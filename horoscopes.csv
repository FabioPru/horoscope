"
2,5 january 2019,aries,"Hurt feelings can be patched up thanks to a lunar aspect that wants you to feel better about yourself. You don’t even have to have a conversation with someone in order to heal. Maybe you just need to write a letter, the kind you don’t mail, but allows you to release pent-up feelings.

"
3,6 january 2019,aries,"Got #goals? If so, then you’ll love today’s sizzling aspects. First there’s a solar eclipse in your house of ambition and success.

Then you’ll be pleased to know that amorous Venus enters your house of free-spirited thinking today. However, this isn’t just about being kinky, so stop thinking 50 Shades. This is more about taking exotic vacations together, dating a brand new type or going to new venues on date night.

"
5,8 january 2019,aries,"Raging against “the machine” could backfire on you big time, Aries. This could mean your boss, a government agency, a cop who pulls you over or a key decision maker. Keep calm and carry on.

"
14,17 january 2019,aries,"Keep your opinions to yourself today. A Moon-Venus opposition indicates that something could be taken wrong way, no matter how diplomatic you are. Don’t put yourself out on a limb in any manner: in writing, contractually, you name it. Tomorrow, though, the situation is quite different.

"
15,18 january 2019,aries,"It’s time to make some major decisions about the direction your life is heading in. Intelligent Mercury meets up with transformational Pluto in your house of goals. You may suddenly rebel against a person or situation that has been holding you back. Bravo!

"
28,1 february 2019,aries,"
Ouch! The two most obstinate planets in the solar system, Mars and Pluto, square off. The temptation to mouth off will be strong; the problem is that you run the risk of telling An Important Person to go f*** off. Probably not your best move. 

"

"
32,5 february 2019,aries,"

"
33,6 february 2019,aries,"
Feeling a bit worn out? It’s possible with the Moon in Pisces. Chill out. Relax. Pamper yourself. Take a nap. Call in sick to work. Recharge your batteries, because you have a very social week ahead.

"
34,7 february 2019,aries,"
A dazzling Sun-Jupiter aspect could bring some amazing people your way, Aries. Keep an open mind. Some of these folks could be quite different than the types you’re used to. You’re not the shy boring type, and these folks certainly know how to live.

"
40,11 march 2019,aries,"
Money will be on your mind today, Aries. With the inspirational Moon forming a trine with Saturn in your career zone, you should be considering all of the ways that you can bring more financial stability to your life. This may mean cutting back on spending, but long run it will be worth it.

"
41,12 march 2019,aries,"
Shhhh!!! Keep your mouth shut, ram. I don’t care if you’re the savviest person in the room. That’s the whole problem: you may very well be the smartest person in the room, and by talking you will divulge too much. The dream stealers and passive aggressive types are out today. Also, watch out for over promising something, as you may not be able to deliver it.

"
42,13 march 2019,aries,"
You should be feeling more powerful and in control, thanks to macho Pluto in a feisty place. But as the ancient Taoist warrior-monks understood, true power is best hidden from prying eyes. Keep your strength a secret and quietly move ahead with your agenda.

"
43,14 march 2019,aries,"
Keep your Spidey sense turned all the way up today, as your intuition will be right on target. This is super helpful as there is so much planetary activity going on in your ambition sector. Cosmic wisdom will come your way.

"
44,15 march 2019,aries,"
Are you dying to be in the spotlight? It’s not a good move under current cosmic skies. No matter how talented you are, or how much you want to share your ideas, you’re better off remaining silent. Don’t worry, this energy doesn’t last long. Sit tight for another week.

"
45,16 march 2019,aries,"
Things that used to seem difficult may now be easier to handle, Aries. That’s because you are stepping into a place of greater personal power. This is good news, as the Sun will be entering your sign next Wednesday. As they say, “more power to you!”

"
47,18 march 2019,aries,"
Rome wasn’t built in a day, Aries! And your dreams are going to take a while to manifest also. Don’t let this get you down. Adjust your expectations and be more realistic about timelines.

"
54,25 march 2019,aries,"
Someone could provide you with excellent advice, so if you’re smart you’ll pay attention to it. You rams can be stubborn at times. The intel you receive could pull you out of a rut, all the more reason to listen.

"
55,27 march 2019,aries,"When the going gets tough, the tough get going. That’s an old, well worn phrase, and as a stubborn ram you know this better than anyone. But with Venus in your twelfth house it’s time to figure out ways to move forward without expending so much freakin’energy.

"
56,31 march 2019,aries,"The floodgates open! Mars enters your oh-so-chatty communications sector, telling you to get your message out there. Your brain will be crackling with ideas and people will be interested in what you have to say. The next two months are superb for socializing and short distance travel. Single rams, your best bet for meeting someone is right in your own neighborhood.

"
57,7 april 2019,aries,"Spend some quiet time today thinking about your long range goals, whatever they might be. Intelligent Mercury is in the most secluded part of your chart, forming a strong aspect with mature Saturn. Naturally you’re going to want to make more money, but isn’t there more to life than that? Consider your personal happiness too.

"
58,8 april 2019,aries,"You may be concerned about your money situation, but things could change in a very interesting way. Subterranean Pluto is helping you come up with new ideas that will increase the size of your bank balance. Just don’t go up against any authority figures this week, especially on Wednesday and Saturday. As my grandma used to say, “keep your cards close to your vest”. Keep quiet and play dumb.

"
59,9 april 2019,aries,"Someone may serve up some criticism today, and you will NOT be in the mood for it. Instead of going on the warpath, quietly pull away and mull things over. Your intuition is high and should be on point. Is there any truth to the criticism? If not, don’t sweat it. You’ve got better things to worry about than someone’s bad attitude.

"
60,10 april 2019,aries,"It’s one thing to be a visionary; it’s another to be in fantasy land. Jupiter begins a four-month retrograde in your house of thinking big. This will demand more attention to detail and planning on your part. That said, by August 11th you could create a magnificent path ahead. Onward and upward!

"
61,11 april 2019,aries,"You will be inexplicably drawn to all things mysterious and hidden, Aries. With magnetic Venus and murky Neptune meeting up in the most confidential part of your chart, you’re going to be like Sherlock Holmes with a magnifying glass. You can also play the role of a sexy spy, so get the boudoir warmed up and ready to go.

"
62,12 april 2019,aries,"Stick to the facts today. Everyone may have an opinion, including you. But opinions mean nothing unless they are backed up by something solid. This may require some patience and you may have to do some digging. However, true knowledge is power.

"
63,13 april 2019,aries,"If there’s something about yourself—or your life—that you’ve been trying to change, you could feel a little stuck. That’s because the Sun is squaring Pluto, planet of transformation. Don’t worry–this energy changes quickly, tomorrow in fact.

"
64,14 april 2019,aries,"Feeling gutsy and bold? You should be! Four  celestial orbs are pushing you to expand. This is no time to be timid. Nor should you listen to naysayers who will put down your ideas.  You’ve got what it takes, Aries, so let it rip.

"
69,19 april 2019,aries,"Hmmmm….you may need to adjust the way you communicate with people in your world, Aries.

"
70,20 april 2019,aries,"The Sun leaves your sign today, but this is no cause for sadness. That’s because El Sol is now in your house of earning and saving more money!

"
71,21 april 2019,aries,"The Sun is now in solid Taurus, which is a grounded sign. But you’re feeling a bit adventurous and there’s nothing wrong with that. Are other people going to be pleased with your sunny new attitude? Maybe not, but that’s not going to stop you.

"
72,22 april 2019,aries,"Thomas Edison, when asked about how he came up with so many inventions, said that “ideas are in the air.” He was acknowledging that inspiration from the cosmos is out there and we can tap into it. Pay attention to your thoughts, as an amazing Sun-Uranus aspect could bring you a money-making idea today and tomorrow.

"
73,23 april 2019,aries,"Adventure is calling your name, but can you afford to go off and do something spontaneous? As long as it doesn’t cost too much, or take time away from your ambitions. With so much energy in your success sector, you have to balance risk with reward.

"
76,26 april 2019,aries,"People around you could be acting out, making you feel unsettled. The best thing that you can do is to remain unmoved, silent even. There could be more drama over the next few days, so let it unfold.

"
77,27 april 2019,aries,"With megamouth Mars in your communicating sector, no doubt you feel perfectly entitled to voice your opinion. The problem is that a difficult Neptune aspect indicates that others may not be as straightforward. This means that you could spill a lot, but they won’t…..and knowledge is power, which they will end up possessing. Be more strategic, Aries.

"
78,28 april 2019,aries,"It’s not your karma in life to suffer in a job or field that isn’t right for you. A Saturn-North Node opposition could make you feel a bit gloomy about your prospects, but not too worry. The ringed planet goes retrograde tomorrow, enabling you to come up with a Plan B.

"
79,29 april 2019,aries,"Slow mo’! Saturn starts to retrograde in your ambition sector, forcing you to slow down and ensure that you’re doing things right. Over the next few months your ideas and plans could change dramatically, for the better at that. But this doesn’t mean that you’ll be thinking small. On the contrary… the sky is the limit.

"
80,30 april 2019,aries,"A confusing Neptune-Mars square could be throwing off both your intuition and  the logical part of your brain. Needless to say, this is not a smart time to make decisions. Nor is it wise to blurt out what’s going on in that brain of yours, as you could be completely off. Silence is the best policy right now.

"
81,1 may 2019,aries,"You could sell ice cream to Eskimos under today’s fabulous aspects. So if you need to get a message out there, start hustling. Make the big ask. Crush it on social media. Flirt your little heart out. Not everyone will bite right away, but at least you’ve got the ball rolling.

"
82,2 may 2019,aries,"Ouch. Someone might try to pull a power play with you, and it could be a doozy. No matter how you try to be diplomatic, or how intelligent your argument might be, it won’t matter. Big egos don’t like to be shot down, do they? This might be one situation that it’s smarter to walk away from.

"
83,3 may 2019,aries,"Your sign is famous for being intrepid and you are going to live up to that reputation today! A wonderful Mercury-Jupiter trine allows you to strike off bravely in the direction of your choice. You won’t be looking back, either. Good for you.

"
84,4 may 2019,aries,"A new Moon occurs in your house of money, ram. This is one of the best times in 2019 to start earning more and saving more. But if you have big dreams that cost money, it’s critical to be conservative in your approach. A Mars-Jupiter opposition warns against diving into expensive ventures too quickly.

"
85,5 may 2019,aries,"People could be blustering and bloviating, and your tolerance for their BS will be pretty low. Before you lash out take a deep breath and count to ten. This battle probably isn’t worth it. Let them take their inflated egos somewhere else.

"
86,6 may 2019,aries,"The road ahead becomes clearer now that Mercury is in your regulated, stable second house.

Pay close attention to your thoughts and dream state as your intuition is high.

"
89,9 may 2019,aries,"You’re feeling feisty and independent… good for you! A terrific Venus-Jupiter trine lifts you up. But not everyone wants to see you soar like an eagle. You know what to do with people like this: ignore them or dump them. The end.

"
90,10 may 2019,aries,"An internal battle may be brewing as you can’t decide whether to come on strong or back down.

"
91,11 may 2019,aries,"From your chart it’s looking like you’re craving more structure in your life, which isn’t such a bad thing. You also wants answers and commitments, so if you need to approach somebody, today is a good time to do so. Next Tuesday also works.

"
92,12 may 2019,aries,"The Moon is in flirtatious Leo, telling you to forget about your responsibilities and just have some fun. It winks at Venus in the house of adventure, all the more reason to take the day off and play. You have a lot of planetary energy later this week focused on career, so chill our and recharge your batteries.

"
93,13 may 2019,aries,"Gotta love it when the two of the most authoritative orbs in the solar system–Pluto and the Sun–are having a bromance. They are in your houses of mo’ money and crushing it in your career, so you are in an awesome spot for making progress. It’s time to step up and take charge of your life rather than waiting for things to fall into your lap.

"
94,14 may 2019,aries,"“You don’t ask, you don’t get.” That’s an old saying thrown around by salespeople and it really is true. A terrific Mars-Venus aspect tells you to ask for what you want: the date, the job, the raise, the wedding ring, the vacation, whatever floats your boat. Don’t assume that everyone is reading your mind.

"
95,15 may 2019,aries,"Big day in the cosmos! Venus enters your house of earning more money, while Mars zips into the domestic sector.

"
96,16 may 2019,aries,"You’re as serious as a heart attack and people will be paying attention to your words. As a result, get important messages out there. Mature, logical Saturn has your back, and verbal Mercury does too. Whether you’re talking things over with a lover or promoting your brand, now’s the time to sat your piece.

"
97,17 may 2019,aries,"Curb your enthusiasm? You may need to temper your words and actions, Aries. A Mercury-Jupiter aspect indicates that you should slow down, promise less and be more attentive to details. A slowdown is not the same as quitting. Keep on moving forward, but be more observant in the process.

"
98,18 may 2019,aries,"The Scorpio full moon is a winner for scoring big, as in Big Money. It falls in your house of net worth, and a fantastic Mercury-Pluto trine could help bring in a raise, new job or higher revenues if you’re self-employed.

101,21 may 2019,aries,"Can we TALK?! Egads, not only does the Sun enter chatty Gemini, so does verbal Mercury. Honey, you are in an awesome position to get the word out over the next few weeks, whatever that means to you! You can crush it on social media. Flirt like no one’s business. Negotiate like a Fortune 500 exec. It’s also a super time for all Aries artists and creatives to shine.

"
102,22 may 2019,aries,"A money-making idea could hit you today and it could be pure genius. Better yet, it won’t be off-the-wall crazy either. Home based businesses are especially favored right now, so consider a side hustle or full-time domestic gig.

"
103,23 may 2019,aries,"If anyone tries to put you down or hold you back, I wish them a lot of luck! People may try to use guilt to get to you. Or perhaps they’ll try to make you think that you can’t pull something off. But they’re wrong, and you know it!

"
104,24 may 2019,aries,"They say that money talks, and right now it may be talking too much. Don’t get caught up in materialistic pursuits, ram. Trying to keep up with others or judging people by their bank account is not the way to go. And if you’re surrounded by people who are doing this, it may be time for some new friends.

"
105,25 may 2019,aries,"It’s Memorial Day weekend in the US and the planets want you to have a good time! Kick off the beginning of summer with the tribe. Plan some adventures. With happy-go-lucky Jupiter in your house of living la vida loca, you DESERVE to have some fun!

"
106,26 may 2019,aries,"Talking things over with someone is a better use of your time than simmering in resentment. It’s also better than arguing. You need to reduce drama, not perpetuate it or increase it. Namaste.

"
107,27 may 2019,aries,"“Slow down, you move too fast. Got to make the morning last! Just kicking down the cobblestones, looking for fun and feeling groovy.” You may be too young to remember this song, but the word “groovy” ought to tip you off that it’s from the 60s. A wonderful Moon-Neptune aspect today recommends that you kick back, relax and have some fun.

"
108,28 may 2019,aries,"Following the rules may make you feel safe. After all, we don’t always want to stand out or appear to be a rebel. But deep inside you may realize that you don’t want to do things the same way as everyone else. You don’t have to! But today’s not a smart time to make a big proclamation about it. Do your own thing behind the scenes.

"
109,29 may 2019,aries,"Shut yo’ mouf! Yeah, it’s a good day to keep things on the downlow. Chatty Mercury squares deceptive Neptune, which just happens to be in the house of confidentiality. Unless you want to make a total fool of yourself, or reveal state secrets to the enemy, you need to zip it. Tight.

"
110,30 may 2019,aries,"Don’t make promises you can’t keep, babe! And watch out for people who could do the same to you. They may not mean any harm, but overoptimistic Jupiter could be sprinkling star dust in their eyes. Tomorrow is a better time to get a clear picture as to what’s going on.

"
111,31 may 2019,aries,"The weekend starts off with a sizzle thanks to amorous Neptune and Venus forming a trine! Not only will these two help you find or enhance love, they can also inspire you to increase your cash flow. If you’ve been considering a job change or entering a new field, this is a good time to do some research.

"
112,1 june 2019,aries,"June begins with a request from the cosmos to balance practicality with taking chances! You’re in an awesome spot to shake things up, but making big changes without thinking them through is just foolish. Relying on gut hunches is not advised right now either. Think things through with the lest side of your brain.

"
113,2 june 2019,aries,"You know what you want and you’re not afraid to ask for it. So go ahead and be vocal! Considering that tomorrow’s new moon occurs in your house of communicating, the next two weeks are perfect for expressing yourself.

"
114,3 june 2019,aries,"The Gemini new Moon helps to put thoughts into words. Practical Saturn is well aspected to this lunation, ensuring that you’ll be thinking logically. As a result you’ll be able to make progress. Just don’t expect everyone else to be as forthright as you are, however. A wonky Neptune aspect could create confusion.

"
115,4 june 2019,aries,"There may be plenty of people trying to tell you what you should do, but that doesn’t mean that you have to listen to them. As a matter of fact, now that logical Mercury is in your house inner comfort, you’re not going to let anyone disrupt the flow of your precious chi.  Keep calm and carry on.

"
116,6 june 2019,aries,"Jangled nerves, stress and discontent start to ease up as gentle Venus is active in your house of stability. Pull away from known divas and a**holes if at all possible. You need a break from the crazy world, ram. Take it.

"
117,7 june 2019,aries,"Be open with people today and tomorrow. Too many tense emotions have been building up, and you need to release them. Do this before Sunday, though, as the cosmic skies get cloudy then.

"
118,11 june 2019,aries,"Sunny optimism works some days, but today is all about being realistic.You can’t afford to use hope and a prayer, as lovely as that sounds. The fiery Sun opposes Jupiter, demanding that logic rules. This theme runs through your chart all the way through the full moon on the 17th, so remain focused.

"
119,12 june 2019,aries,"In Italian families there is often a person who becomes the consigliere, whether they like it or not. This is the name for someone who gets stuck doing all of the hand holding, the peace making and problem solving. It’s usually a thankless job! So if your family (or friends) view you as the go-to person when the sh** hits the fan, then maybe it’s time to drop this role.

"
120,13 june 2019,aries,"Tone things down a little, ram. Your sign is well known for being direct but right now you need to be a bit more diplomatic. Don’t worry, you won’t be perceived as being weak!

"
121,14 june 2019,aries,"Flattery will get you everywhere today; being straightforward will not. You’re such an independent, confident sign that you tend to tell it like it is. Not today, ram! Let your talent shine too. People will be impressed by your skills and eloquence.

"
122,15 june 2019,aries,"You’re always so understanding of other people’s needs; now it’s your turn. A lunar aspect urges you to say what’s on your mind. This is especially true with family and a lover. Otherwise tension will build and reach critical mass, most likely by the middle of next week.

"
123,16 june 2019,aries,"This is a good day to go with the flow rather than following a typical routine. You’re in an intuitive place, so use your sixth sense to your advantage. People may criticize you for being so vibey instead of rational, but what do they know? Unless they’re an Aries too, they’re in the dark.

"
124,17 june 2019,aries,"The Sagittarius full moon could bring an audacious plan to a successful finale! And if you haven’t been working on anything that’s adventurous, it’s a good time to start. From your chart it appears that you’re growing tired of being hemmed in. Carpe diem.

"
125,18 june 2019,aries,"Determination sets in as a strong Saturn aspect fires up your resolve. Love, career, money matters: you want things done and you want them done now. But what’s nice is that there is a sense of ease with this, a knowingness that things will work out well.

"
126,19 june 2019,aries,"Ugh. A standoff between Mars and Pluto is going to bring out egos and tempers. Authority figures or systems (like a government agency) could be difficult to deal with. It’s up to you as to whether you should engage in this battle or not. If you can, wait until Friday to deal with these people.

"
127,21 june 2019,aries,"Big day in the cosmos! The Sun enters Cancer, your domestic sector, and Neptune starts to retrograde. Over the next few weeks some old childhood dramas and family dynamics could come back, if just in your mind. It’s important to work through these issues now. A solar eclipse occurs here on July 3rd, and it gives you the opportunity to move ahead with a lighter heart.

"
128,22 june 2019,aries,"Don’t be so emo! This could be tough to do with the Moon in the most sensitive part of your chart. Instead of letting your feelings take over, why not dig a little deeper and ask yourself what those emotions are trying to tell you.

"
129,23 june 2019,aries,"It’s one thing to be a visionary and another to be a bloody fool. People will be thinking larger than life today, but that doesn’t mean that they have a clue about what’s going on. Watch out for unrealistic thinking, not only on the part of others, but with yourself.
 

"
130,24 june 2019,aries,"You may appear confident on the outside, but inside is another story. With murky Neptune in a shaky spot in the most psychological part of your chart, you could be a bit emotional. A strong lunar aspect tomorrow helps you realize just how much you have going for you!

"
131,25 june 2019,aries,"Sometimes less is more, Aries. You’re better off taking on a few things and finishing them rather than too many and doing a half assed job. Mercury enters your talent sector tomorrow, so you will be in an excellent place to lavish your skills on a few important choices.

"
132,26 june 2019,aries,"How sweet it is! Lively Mercury zips into your house of romance, shopping, dining out and having fun. Take this energy and run with it before Mercury goes retrograde on July 7th. The pace may slow down a little bit between then and the 19th.

"
133,27 june 2019,aries,"Something unusual could happen today, something that will bring you greater peace of mind. Maybe it’s a raise or a job offer. Perhaps a family or romantic situation gets resolved to your liking. The next three days are all well aspected for creating more stability in your life.

"
134,28 june 2019,aries,"You’re playing for keeps, something that people are going to start to realize about you. Logical Saturn is guiding you in your long term decision making. This is important, as two eclipses in July will bring about massive changes in your career and home environment.

"
135,29 june 2019,aries,"You are so used to being direct and honest that sometimes you forget that a little bit of charm go a long way. A sweet lunar aspect can help you speak or write the kind of words that will impress and cajole others. Go back to being an obstinate ram another day!

"
136,30 june 2019,aries,"People may try to talk you out of doing something that you desire. The question is: should you listen to them? Maybe they’re jealous and don’t want to see you succeed. Or maybe they have your back, but they have a limited view as to what is possible. Don’t give up your dreams that easily. Stand up for what you want!

"
137,1 july 2019,aries,"Red hot Mars enters your romance zone, turning up the heat and spice factor! New love can be found. Existing relationships can take a dramatic, sexy turn. Just make sure that you aren’t so bogged down in home and caree5r matters that you don’t have time to enjoy this delicious energy.

"
138,2 july 2019,aries,"Work, work, work. It may seem that you just can’t get away from it. Pay close attention, Aries, because tomorrow’s solar eclipse may make you choose between your personal life and your professional one. If a boss (or your own business) is sucking you dry, some changes need to be made, stat.

"
139,3 july 2019,aries,"The focus is on your nearest and dearest as a solar eclipse occurs in Cancer, your domestic sector. The urge to nest and spend more time with loved ones will increase as gentle Venus enters this house today also. However, work demands may be pressing on you, and you may have some hard choices to make. If a job or other big goal is taking too much away from your personal life, it’s time to do some thinking.

"
140,4 july 2019,aries,"Some tough decisions need to be made about your personal life and your career. This is going to require an open mind. The ability to recognize new possibilities is the key, so don’t get stuck in a traditional groove. Let other people play by the rules or do things to keep people happy. You need to go your own way.

"
141,5 july 2019,aries,"The Moon, Jupiter and Neptune form a happy triangle in the heavens, encouraging you to live life a little bolder. This not only includes the “outside”–your appearance or the activities you take part of–but your inner world as well. Why not study a new philosophy or concept, such as Zen or mindfulness?

"
142,6 july 2019,aries,"The Virgo Moon sets up a sporty kind of a day. So go ahead, work that body! Swim, hike, play tennis or golf, or go to the gym and take a class. Then make this a habit, because you’re going to need vibrant health. An eclipse in the most ambitious part of your chart occurs on the 16th, and it’s going to be intense.

"
143,7 july 2019,aries,"Egads! Mercury goes retrograde in your house of romance. Between now and the 19th you need to watch what you say (and text) to a lover. Old issues could come back, needing to be dealt with. Don’t forget that red hot Mars is in this sector too, which could amp up drama. Oh….and I would be remiss if I didn’t tell you that old lovers could come slithering back too. Gird your loins.

"
144,8 july 2019,aries,"Changes need to be made at home and with your family, and this is a good time to do so. The Sun and Venus are both in this part of your chart, so you have cosmic support. The key to handling these issues intelligently is to use logic, not emotions. Facts will win the day over feelings.

"
145,9 july 2019,aries,"People will be playing hard ball today, so get ready for stubbornness and attitudes. The fiery Sun opposes disciplined Saturn. This is NOT a good time to bend the rules, tell the boss to go f**k off, or get way too emotional in the wrong setting. Keep calm and carry on.

"
146,10 july 2019,aries,"Someone close may need a shoulder to cry on today. Or maybe they just need some advice. Be there for them, as you’ll be able to provide inspiration and balance.

"
147,11 july 2019,aries,"Emotions can get heated as the two cosmic hotheads, Mars and Uranus, square off against each other in the heavens. Someone could say or do something that will throw you off balance. Heck, even you might do something that’s out of character. Think before you react.

"
148,12 july 2019,aries,"It’s a great day to indulge in anything of a creative nature or a sports activity. Your need to grow mentally, and even though many people view hobbies and sports as something primarily done for relaxation, they can also expand your mind. Which is precisely why you should try a new technique or activity.

"
149,13 july 2019,aries,"Your sign is never shy about taking on an adventure or new challenge! That’s why today’s Moon-Jupiter meet-up is custom made for your intrepid sign. Go ahead, take a risk of some kind. The areas of love and creativity are the best place to shake things up, as is foreign travel.

"
150,14 july 2019,aries,"Last week a Sun-Saturn opposition placed your needs against those of a job or a person who may be demanding that things be done their way. Well, here we go again: today the Sun opposes Pluto, and it’s the same kind of tense energy. Fortunately the upcoming lunar eclipse (on Tuesday) puts you in the driver’s seat, so don’t get all emo. Have the last laugh instead.

"
151,15 july 2019,aries,"Good heavens, are you motivated! The Moon swings past Saturn and Pluto in the most ambitious part of your chart. Nothing is going to stop you, and tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in this sector will make that clear to everyone–including the trolls and wannabes.

"
152,16 july 2019,aries,"Ladies and gentlemen, a drumroll please…..a lunar eclipse is occurring in Capricorn, your house of ambition. Something that you’ve been working hard on will come to pass, ram, probably within the next two to four weeks. Truth be told, not everyone is going to be thrilled with your success but that’s their problem. Get ready to take a bow.

"
153,17 july 2019,aries,"“I wanted it yesterday!”  That may be your attitude thanks to a tough Venus-Saturn opposition. Yesterday’s eclipse has gotten you all fired up to chase after your dreams, which is a good thing. But getting pushy about it and expecting immediate results is not. Chill out. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

"
154,18 july 2019,aries,"Yum! A lovely meeting of the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, creates a romantic mood. But this aspect also bodes well for inspiring creativity. Feeling better about yourself is possible too, as there is a nice healing vibe going on.

"
155,19 july 2019,aries,"Making peace with loved ones becomes a simpler task now that verbal Mercury is in Cancer. There has been some tense energy all month in this department, but you’re now entering into a much more peaceful phase. And a friskier one, too—-the Sun enters Leo, your house of having fun, on Monday!

"
156,20 july 2019,aries,"“Things cannot remain in stillness forever”, says Taoist author Deng Ming Dao. “Storms may destroy some things, but they also prepare the way for life…there must be an opportunity for new things to emerge and begin their own cycle.” That’s the message that the cosmos has for you as a number of planets are engaged in a standoff in the heavens. Pluto, planet of transformation, wants you to move on, but you’re holding back. It’s time to let go.

"
157,21 july 2019,aries,"People aren’t mind readers, so stop expecting them to know what’s going on in that head of yours. A productive Sun-Mercury aspect helps you communicate with people who count, especially family members and a lover. It’s time to put home and family matters to rest anyway, as the Sun is leaving this part of your chart tomorrow.

"
158,22 july 2019,aries,"Woo-hoo!! The Sun enters Leo, the most fun loving part of your chart. It’s officially time to shop for swag, dine out, attend concerts and go to the movies. Romance gets a big boost also, so plan some amorous date nights and weekends with your honey. Single and looking? Venus enters this sector on Saturday, so it will become easier to find a mate.

"
159,23 july 2019,aries,"You’ve got it going ON, Aries. Seriously–with the Moon in your sign winking at charismatic Mars, you are practically glowing. Nothing wrong with that either, as you will attract people who want to get to know you better. This could be a potential romantic partner, but it could also be a new BFF or industry connection.

"
160,24 july 2019,aries,"You’ve never been someone to hold back when it comes to chasing after a dream. But sometimes you just have to wait for the right cosmic energy to be in place to do so. Well Aries, a terrific Mercury-Venus link opens up doors. Get ready to walk through them.

"
161,25 july 2019,aries,"Over the next few days it may feel as though a big burden has been removed from your life. Has it really, or is it a positive shift in your attitude? Who cares! What matters is that optimism is returning thanks to abundant Jupiter in a good spot. This energy will increase through August 11th, at which time you’ll feel even more jazzed.

"
162,26 july 2019,aries,"Curb your enthusiasm? You may need to tone things down a bit. Being flamboyant or too confident about your abilities and personality could rub people the wrong way. Don’t worry, this doesn’t last long. In 24 hours glamorous Venus enters your house of drama and creativity, at which time you can let it rip!

"
163,27 july 2019,aries,"Ggrrrr!! Magnetic Venus glides into sultry Leo, catching up with her cosmic lover, Mars. The entire Leo season could be full of fun, flirting and amorous adventures. The new moon arriving on August 1st opens up a fresh chapter in love, and also your creativity. Develop your talents and show them off!

"
164,28 july 2019,aries,"Stop settling, Aries. That’s the message from Chiron, the Wounded Healer. You deserve a fabulous love life. You need more time off for personal pursuits, like hobbies or going out on the town. But you’ll never have these things if you don’t make the effort!

"
165,29 july 2019,aries,"Sometimes in life we beat ourselves up, saying, “Oh, I don’t have the talent to do that” (whatever “that” may be). Other times we think we have what it takes to do something, but we really don’t! Today’s cosmic energy demands that you take a realistic view about your habits, beliefs or skill level. It’s no big deal if you need to improve; accept it and then do what it takes to move ahead.

"
166,30 july 2019,aries,"The old adage about being the iron hand in the velvet glove applies to you today, Aries. If you need to demonstrate strength you’re better off doing it with charm and eloquence rather than blunt force. This is not your typical MO but hey, sometimes ya just gotta butter people up.

"
167,31 july 2019,aries,"Finally. Your family, lover, roommate or landlord may get off your back! Mercury is now direct in your domestic sector, helping you iron out residential and personality issues. From now through August 11th you should do whatever it takes to settle down this part of your life.

"
168,1 august 2019,aries,"Rawr! A sizzling new moon occurs in Leo, your house of romance. You now have the cosmos’ permission to be a flirtatious as you want, and if that means having a fling, so be it. Of course you can indulge in a more serious romantic encounter, which many rams will take advantage of. But issues about security could arise, especially the financial kind. Make sure that love is not blinding you to a lack of dinero.

"
169,2 august 2019,aries,"Don’t be so emo! A Venus-Uranus square could set off some major sensitivity to what others say and do. This could throw you off balance, making you think that things are worse than they actually are. Relax. Once the Moon changes signs tomorrow you’ll be in a far more practical place.

"
170,3 august 2019,aries,"The weekend is here and you’ll be in the mood for getting things done. Sure, you could use this energy to clean out the garage or balance your checkbook. But the cosmos calls for getting back into hobbies or sports that you may be neglecting. Is there a new activity you’d like to try? Then look into it and start, as next week is awesome for creative and physical outlets.

"
171,4 august 2019,aries,"Everyone has an opinion and a lot of them have a good point! All the more reason to pay attention to what others have to say. You are entering into one of the most mind expanding weeks you’ve had in a long time. Don’t be too proud to admit that there are savvier people out there. Soak up their wisdom.

"
172,5 august 2019,aries,"The Libra Moon is helping you to play nice with others, a situation that isn’t always easy for your independent sign. Listen, you don’t have to agree with everything they say and do. Just be more tolerant. There could be a surprise payoff down the road for you if you do.

"
173,6 august 2019,aries,"Do you want to make money or lose it? A Moon-Uranus opposition could make you operate with emotions and haste, never a good plan when it comes to finances. There are some stellar aspects ahead for earning more. Balance your bright ideas with some serious number crunching before you act.

"
174,7 august 2019,aries,"A fabulous Sun-Jupiter trine creates a level of optimism that you haven’t witnessed in ages, ram! Your creativity and talent are blossoming. Romance is poised to take an adventurous turn. If you feel as though the sky is the limit, you’re on the right track. And if you’re not there yet, you will be next week when Jupiter goes direct on Sunday.

"
175,8 august 2019,aries,"Romance sizzles with a delightful Venus-Jupiter trine! You should be feeling more adventurous, not only when it comes to love but in all areas of your life. Make a vow to do something out of the ordinary this week. Even if it has to be scheduled for some time in the near future, plan it now.

"
176,9 august 2019,aries,"It’s time to find a happy medium between thinking with your head and feeling with your heart. With so much planetary activity in dramatic Leo these days, you run the risk of running on pure emotions. Don’t forget that the grey matter between your ears has value too. That said, the mood is still dreamy!

"
177,10 august 2019,aries,"Is honesty always the best policy? You’re feeling charming and free spirited, thanks to all of the planetary action in vivacious Leo. But you run the risk of revealing too much…or maybe trusting the wrong person. Have all the fun you want, but keep some information under lock and key.

"
178,11 august 2019,aries,"Big day in the cosmos! Logical Mercury enters your romance sector, dialing down the drama (phew). Optimistic Jupiter goes direct in your house of adventure (yee-ha!) and Uranus starts to retrograde in your income house (keep an eye on cash flow). You’re going to want to take more chances, which is a good thing….as long as they don’t cost too much money.

"
179,12 august 2019,aries,"Despite all of the fun, flirty energy going on in your chart, today you mean business. A Moon-Saturn conjunction makes you both passionate and determined to see something through. Set your sights on something that’s important to you and remain focused as a laser beam.

"
180,13 august 2019,aries,"Trying to talk sense to someone who needs to hear it? Good luck with that. A Mercury-Moon opposition will make it difficult for people around you to think logically. The full moon on Thursday is the best time to make them wake up, so hold off until then if you can.

"
181,14 august 2019,aries,"Ggrrrr!!! Romantic Venus meets up with the fiery Sun in your house of romance, making for one steamy day. If you’re looking for love both online sites and matchmaking friends could work. This aspect is also super for creative projects, so dive in and make your mark.

"
182,15 august 2019,aries,"The Aquarius full moon focuses on the people in your world, the ones who truly count. Make sure that you’re spending time with the kind who appreciate and respect you. Frenemies, iffy lovers and people who bring too much drama to the table should be deleted. You’ve got too much going for you to put up with trolls and malcontents.

"
183,16 august 2019,aries,"Don’t let emotions cloud your judgment when it comes to money matters. Erratic Uranus is stirring stuff up in your cash sector, and it could be easy to respond with feelings rather than facts. Fortunately a slew of celestial orbs are about to enter practical Virgo, at which time you’ll be able to use more logic!

"
184,17 august 2019,aries,"It’s not your karma to work in a soul-sucking job for the rest of your life. Nor is it your destiny to put up with all sorts of crap from relatives or a lover. The North Node of the Moon opposes Saturn, letting you know that the time has come for living a happy, authentic life. When Mars and the Sun enter efficient Virgo next week, you’ll be able to make a lot of changes.

"
185,18 august 2019,aries,"Got the urge to purge? Energetic Mars is in Virgo, your sixth house of organization. Other orbs go there later this week, so don’t be surprised to find that you actually feel like cleaning the house and getting all caught up on errands! This also happens to be your fitness sector. Starting a new diet or exercise regimen is favored, especially this coming weekend. You will be surprisingly disciplined!

"
186,19 august 2019,aries,"It’s time to show the world just how dynamic and talented you truly are. A Moon-Mercury aspect helps you get the word out! Find a platform that works best for you. The upcoming Virgo season is incredibly productive for you, so start getting ready now. Fame and fortune come to those who hustle under these aspects.

"
187,20 august 2019,aries,"Do you work for the police or fire department? Do you rescue people for a living? No? Then why are you trying to help someone who clearly needs to figure something out for themselves! Sometimes the best way to assist someone is to let them make a mistake and learn from it. It’s called tough love and it often works.

"
188,21 august 2019,aries,"“The way a person does one thing is the way they do everything.” You’ve probably heard that quote before, and it applies to you right now! It’s time to do things in a far more interesting way, and this includes the small things. Be fussy. Be particular. Give everything that added dollop of pizzazz. Make life more interesting!

"
189,22 august 2019,aries,"Doubts may start creeping in, throwing you off balance. But is there any substance to them? Probably not! This is one of the best times of year for you. Enjoying the sweeter side of life is what it’s all about. Stop worrying about things that aren’t true problems.

"
190,23 august 2019,aries,"Reality starts to set in as the Sun enters practical Virgo! You’ll be even more motivated than usual to get a grip on your personal and professional lives. This year Mars and Venus are also in this organized sign, and logical Mercury arrives soon. The upside is that your health, career and finances can all benefit from your hard work.

"
191,24 august 2019,aries,"Your motivation rises to get into superb physical condition as gorgeous Venus meets up with energetic Mars. Find an exercise buddy to work out with. Involved in a romantic relationship? The couple that plays together stays together, so make a pact with your lover to get healthy together. Besides, think of all the energy you’ll have for “other stuff.”

But in order to do that you need to get your life together–your work flow at the office, personal vitality and fitness, being caught up on errands and generally not feeling like you’re always up against a deadline. Slacker Neptune opposes the new moon though, whispering in your ear that you should stick to doing things the same old way. Wrong. Make the necessary changes.

290,6 may 2019,taurus,"Good news! Level headed Mercury glides into your sign, adding more planetary firepower to the house of Taurus. Your intuition may be off this week due to Venus in a tough spot, but Mercury’s new position will help you observe things with clarity and contentment.

"
291,7 may 2019,taurus,"Confusion may exist about where a particular plan, project or relationship is heading. Things will become more clear over the next few days and there could be some positive surprise twists, so stay tuned.

"
292,8 may 2019,taurus,"It’s showtime! Say buh-bye to a dreary old self-image and lifestyle. Magnetic Mercury meets up with rebellious Uranus in Taurus today. This is truly a game changer, as your life could do a 180 degree turn. But it all starts with you. The cavalry is not going to ride in to rescue you. Start making things happen.

"
293,9 may 2019,taurus,"It’s always a wonderful thing when your head and your heart are working in sync together, and that is what is happening today. Make sure to surround yourself with only the people who support you. The last thing you need is someone who wants to burst your bubble. If you need some alone time, take it.

"
294,10 may 2019,taurus,"It will take all of your effort to see things for what they truly are, Taurus. A Venus-Pluto square could find you in fantasy land. This could make you easy prey for people with agendas, so watch out for them.

"
295,11 may 2019,taurus,"With the Sun in your sign, it’s all about you these days. You’re thinking about the year ahead and all of the juicy things you’d like to experience. A Sun-Saturn trine is telling you to create a bucket list with only fun things on it, the bolder the better. Hey, if you don’t do some of these things now, you may never get around to them.

"
296,12 may 2019,taurus,"A gentle breeze of comfort and happiness is blowing through Taurus today. A sweet Moon-Venus aspect is perfect for relaxing at home or heading to a day spa for some pampering. Take good care of yourself, whatever it takes. The rest of this week is going to be pretty energetic (in a good way) so recharge your batteries.

"
297,13 may 2019,taurus,"Damn, you’re determined! With the fiery Sun trining no-nonsense Pluto, you are a force to be reckoned with. Pluto is all about personal transformation. It’s about digging deep into your soul and asking yourself if you’re on the right track. Is it time to do a 180? Maybe! Only you can answer that question.

"
298,14 may 2019,taurus,"The cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, are in a flirtatious mood today. Venus especially is feeling adventurous, recommending that you take a chance on a new type of lover. Already attached? Then today (and the rest of the week) is perfect for planning your next romantic getaway.

"
299,15 may 2019,taurus,"Yes! Glamorous Venus enters your sign, so the next three weeks are prime for a makeover. Make sure you look good because Mars zips into the house of self expression. The way you think, speak, write (and express yourself through the arts) will all be a part of the package that is you.

"
300,16 may 2019,taurus,"Minds are like parachutes: they work best when they’re wide open! That’s the message that the cosmos has for you these days, Taurus. Sign up for classes. Listen to podcasts. Meet people from different countries, or who have a totally different philosophy about life than you do. Try new hobbies or sports. Life is short, and there is so much to try!

"
301,17 may 2019,taurus,"We all need a little attitude adjustment from time to time. After all, what we think ends up influencing what we say and do. A Mercury-Jupiter aspect helps you find more effective ways to handle emotions and thought patterns.

"
302,18 may 2019,taurus,"Ready for some adventure? More important, is your lover ready for it too? Because if they’re not you just may have to find someone who’s game for some fresh experiences! The full moon takes place in your commitment sector, but it’s very focused on you: are you enjoying life to the fullest? Are you the person you truly want to be? If not, bust out of an old groove and live a more authentic life.

"
303,19 may 2019,taurus,"The Sun will remain in Taurus for another 48 hours, so pull out your bucket list. Come up with plans for the year ahead. Once the Sun enters Gemini on Tuesday you’ll be in a great place to figure out the next moves you need to make.

"
304,20 may 2019,taurus,"Follow your gut today, and your emotions too. Your friends and other people may try to tell you to go a different route, but your own wisdom is best. Tuesday is super for gaining more clarity, because spunky Mars is active in your house of thinking.

"
305,21 may 2019,taurus,"Cha-ching! Ah, the luscious sound of the cash register ringing, a sound near and dear to the Taurus heart. You love money and it loves you, and right now you can score more of it. Not only has the Sun entered Gemini, your income sector, but so has shrewd Mercury. Over the next month you can make enormous strides when it comes to increasing your cash flow.

"
306,22 may 2019,taurus,"You are an absolute force of nature today, thanks to a Mars-Uranus meet up. Uranus is the planet of brilliant ideas and it acts quickly, which means that you could do a complete 180 degree turn. So don’t be surprised if you decide to change your life’s path in a heartbeat and swiftly move on to something new.

"
307,23 may 2019,taurus,"You know how people say “you have to fake it til you make it’? What they mean, of course, is that sometimes you have to play the role of the person you want to be in the future, even if your circumstances right now aren’t exactly to your liking. It might feel a bit awkward but you should give it a try.

"
308,24 may 2019,taurus,"Gentle Venus is in your sign, perhaps making you more forgiving than usual. Don’t be too quick to cut people slack, Taurus. They may take advantage of it. There’s nothing wrong with holding people to high standards.

"
309,25 may 2019,taurus,"You need some guarantees these days, especially when it comes to love and money. A happy Jupiter-Moon aspect will help you get answers to some of the questions that are burning in your mind. Sunday is well aspected for digging deep, so the cosmos is working in your favor.

"
310,26 may 2019,taurus,"According to your chart, you seem to be a bit unfocused. Perhaps you have too much on your plate. Or maybe your mind is consumed with fears and stress. It’s time to clear out the mental cobwebs and focus like a laser beam. This will mean cutting out distractions, including some people, but it has to be done.

"
311,27 may 2019,taurus,"If you need help, don’t feel shy about asking for favors. Friends, colleagues or mentors will be happy to help you. From your chart it appears that you have always been there for them. Now it’s your turn to cash in.

"
312,28 may 2019,taurus,"This may sound a bit cold, Taurus, but not everyone deserves to be in your life. This goes for friends, colleagues and team members. It could even apply to your family and a lover. If anyone is bringing too much drama and stress into your life, it may be time to pull away a bit.

"
313,29 may 2019,taurus,"You know that sappy saying, “there is no ‘I’ in the word ‘team’ “? Well, try telling that to other people today! Let’s just say that cooperation will be hard to come by, so don’t expect it. You may need to be the voice of reason in a group effort, but if people are slacking off too much, then wait until tomorrow. The energy is much better then.

"
314,30 may 2019,taurus,"Hide the credit cards. Avoid Amazon and Ebay. Car showrooms? Don’t even think about it. The same goes for luxury boutiques and swanky online shopping sites. A Mercury-Jupiter opposition warns that your eyes will be bigger than your wallet. Overspending is a real possibility, so it’s Target and McDonald’s for you, my friend. Hold the fries.

"
315,31 may 2019,taurus,"With va-va-va-voom Venus in your sign, you can attract people to you like moths to a flame. Naturally this could mean a new lover, but everyone is going to want to bask in your glow. This is looking like one heck of a social weekend, so put on some gorgeous clothes and head out the door. Your public is waiting for you, dahling.

"
316,1 june 2019,taurus,"Just what exactly IS charisma, anyway? People who exude magnetism don’t necessarily have the same kinds of charm. Audrey Hepburn’s charisma was way different than, say, Marilyn Monroe’s. Obama’s appeal is nothing like Brad Cooper’s. With charming Venus in your sign, it’s time to think about the message you’re sending out, and how to improve it.

"
317,2 june 2019,taurus,"You know what you want, and the good thing is that nothing is going to get in your way. Does that mean that there will be no roadblocks, no obstacles to get past? Hell no! They will be there. You simply won’t care, that’s all. And that’s a beautiful place to be.

"
318,3 june 2019,taurus,"Yeah, baby! Today’s sparkling new Moon occurs in your house of earning and saving more money. A terrific Pluto-Saturn-Venus aspect encourages you to take some chances, such as changing fields or maybe even starting your own business. But make sure to follow your own wisdom. Friends, colleagues and family members could get a little jealous and give you advice that isn’t solid.

"
319,4 june 2019,taurus,"Chatty Mercury enters your house of communication, opening up the floodgates! You are going to have a lot to say over the next few weeks, that’s for sure. This could be one of the best times in 2019 to brainstorm and network with other people. It also rocks for partying and flirting, I might add. Have fun!

"
320,5 june 2019,taurus,"Words can cut like a knife or they can heal. The choice is yours. Do you want to go ballistic or be a peace maker? While you’re at it, consider the way you talk to yourself. Maybe you should be a bit kinder.

"
321,6 june 2019,taurus,"Venus spends another 48 hours in your sign, so make the most of it! If you’ve been thinking about updating your appearance with some new clothes and a different hairstyle, then go for it. In astrology what counts is when you start something. Even if it takes a few weeks or months to pull off a new look, the important thing is that you got it going when glamorous Venus was in Taurus.

"
322,7 june 2019,taurus,"Today is perfectly aspected for being spontaneous and doing whatever you want! Spunky Uranus is in your sign, telling you to forget your worries and responsibilities. If you can’t cut loose today then find some time over the weekend to have some fun.

"
323,11 june 2019,taurus,"A Sun-Jupiter opposition warns against taking on unnecessary debt or overspending. With optimistic Jupiter in your house of credit cards and net worth, you may think that you’ll have no problem whatsoever finding the money later on to pay the bills. Really? Stay conservative with your money through the 23rd.

"
324,12 june 2019,taurus,"Are you underselling yourself? Perhaps you think that you’re not as brainy or eloquent as others. Maybe you’re shy at get-togethers and lack confidence. It’s time to get rid of this ridiculous notion. When the Sun enters Cancer on the 21st you’ll start to realize that you have brains—just like the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz!

"
325,13 june 2019,taurus,"Breaking the rules can be fun sometimes. However, sticking to the tried and true also has its merits. Today you can find a balance between being edgy and playing it safe. Not everyone can pull this off, but you’ll figure out how to do it.

"
326,14 june 2019,taurus,"You may think you know what’s best but it would be wise to seek a second opinion. Even if a trusted individual tells you what you already know, it’s worth it to get the feedback. This energy continues into next week, so keep an open mind.

"
327,15 june 2019,taurus,"People may be trying to get their way by wearing you down, thinking that you have a soft side. Well, you DO have a tender heart but you’re nobody’s fool. Hold your ground too, as this energy goes into next week and reaches a crescendo on Wednesday, Give ’em an inch and they’ll take a mile, my friend.

"
328,16 june 2019,taurus,"You should only be listening to people who are 100% trustworthy, Taurus. They will aid and inspire you. They will point out fresh avenues for you to explore. Also, avoid the kind of people who want to do things the same old way, “because that’s how we’ve only done it.” You need to have your mind expanded, not restricted.

"
329,17 june 2019,taurus,"Its time to get serious about your finances, Taurus. Tonight’s full moon occurs in your net worth sector. Risk-adverse Saturn is warning against doing anything crazy, though. Like quitting the day job when you don’t have anything else lined up. Or putting money in speculative investments. Play it safe for now.

"
330,18 june 2019,taurus,"You can move mountains, as verbal Mercury meets up with assertive Mars in your communication sector. If you need to make a big ask or get your point across to someone, today is a good time to do so. Tomorrow and Thursday, not so much. Strike while the iron is hot.

"
331,19 june 2019,taurus,"People will be spouting all sorts of ideas today, and chances are they want you to buy into them. But with shrewd Mercury and assertive Mars in your house of quick thinking, you’ll be nobody’s fool. Just don’t tell them that, OK?

"
332,20 june 2019,taurus,"With unpredictable Uranus acting up in your sign, you might be tempted to do or say something unusual. The problem is that the Moon squares Uranus from your house of authority figures, which means that there could be some backlash. Do you really want to piss off a boss, client, cop, judge or government agency? Or someone close whose opinion means a lot to you? Be careful.

"
333,21 june 2019,taurus,"You’re known by the company you keep, Taurus. Two major planetary aspects will force you to examine your connections, both personal and business. First, Neptune retrogrades in your house of friends and colleagues. And the Sun enters Cancer, one of the most social parts of your chart. So over the next few weeks you could be in the presence of a lot of people, but are they the right ones for you?

"
334,22 june 2019,taurus,"What are your most closely held values, Taurus? With the Moon in your house of cherished thoughts, it’s important to give this some thought. A powerful lunar aspect next Tuesday will help you realize that your life is not predetermined in any way. You can  choose some new values!

"
335,23 june 2019,taurus,"Your emotions——and those of others— could be going all over the place, courtesy of a Venus-Jupiter opposition. One minute you may be feeling settled and practical, and the next you could be reeling from a jealous hissy fit. This energy continues into tomorrow so do your best to chill out!

"
336,24 june 2019,taurus,"Getting involved with a good cause will change not only the lives of other people, but also your own. You may not have a lot of time right now, but try to carve out just a little. Eventually you’ll be able to devote more attention to it. Just make sure that you get involved in an organized group, otherwise you’ll quickly lose interest.

"
337,25 june 2019,taurus,"Learn from your mistakes and move on, Taurus. With the Sun, Mercury and Mars all in the most thoughtful part of your chart you’ll be able to figure out how you went off track—-and how to avoid this in the future. You’re nobody’s fool and you won’t make the same mistakes twice.

"
338,26 june 2019,taurus,"Take care of home and family related matters now that logical Mercury is in your domestic sector. It’s important to jump on this immediately, as aspects in early July could heat things up. There will be an eclipse on the 3rd and Mercury starts to retrograde on the 7th. You’ve been warned!

"
339,27 june 2019,taurus,"What a winner of a day! With spunky Uranus active in your sign, you can impress the daylights out of everyone. Needless to say this energy is good for your career, so shamelessly plug yourself. Negotiate deals. Explain your brilliant ideas. But you can also flirt and party to your heart’s content too.

"
340,28 june 2019,taurus,"Some of your ideas may not be as crazy as you think, Taurus. So don’t listen to what other people have to say. Nor should you pay attention to that little voice of fear that wants to keep you trapped doing the same old thing. With the Moon in your sign your true passions will rise.

"
341,29 june 2019,taurus,"Making amends on the home front is possible thanks to a positive lunar aspect. The Moon is in Taurus, which will help you protect your own interests while still cooperating with others. People may be more agreeable than you’d expect.

"
342,30 june 2019,taurus,"Hard work pays off, something that you know all about. After all, you’re one of the most grounded signs of the zodiac! But a Moon-Saturn opposition may bring unrealistic expectations about what is possible. Don’t assume that everything is going to fall into place quickly and neatly; it may be more involved than that.

"
343,1 july 2019,taurus,"Home and family matters pick up momentum now that assertive Mars is in this part of your chart. Moving and redecorating could happen, along with starting a family of your own! Just don’t rush in, as Mercury will be going retrograde here from the 7th through the 19th.

"
344,2 july 2019,taurus,"Watch your words, oh raging bull. You like to tell it the way you see it but it’s not a good time for being so direct. Wait for smooth talking Venus to enter your house of communicating, which happens tomorrow!

"
345,3 july 2019,taurus,"The floodgates open as a sparkling solar eclipse occurs in your house of thinking, speaking and writing! Over the next six months you’ll be quite chatty and social. Fabulous ideas will come your way. The only thing to watch out for is being too opinionated, an issue with mature Saturn opposing this lunation.

"
346,4 july 2019,taurus,"Yesterday’s eclipse was designed to jostle your mind into new ways of thinking. Neurologists say that our brains tend to have repetitive thoughts because they create grooves, or neural pathways. They’re kind of like a path through the woods that remains clear because it is used so much. The good news from the scientific community is that these grooves can go buh-bye. It’s called “neural plasticity”, and today’s aspects encourage you to be open to that possibility.

"
347,5 july 2019,taurus,"Need to talk to someone? Then reach out to a trusted friend or family member. You’ve been carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders and it’s time to lessen that load. Someone else’s opinion could help you recognize options that you hadn’t even considered.

"
348,6 july 2019,taurus,"Give yourself permission to play! The Moon is in the most carefree part of your chart, so find a person to share good times with. It’s a great weekend for taking up a hobby or sport, or getting back to one that you used to enjoy. Life’s too short to be working and worrying all of the time.

"
349,7 july 2019,taurus,"How are things at home? Getting along with the family unit? I sure hope so, because Mercury starts to retrograde today in your domestic sector. Issues from the past could come back, demanding to be resolved. Fortunately this is short lived (it lasts through the 19th). You have a lot of planetary firepower in your communications zone, so don’t be shy about speaking up.

"
350,8 july 2019,taurus,"Don’t hold back! Say what’s in your mind and in your heart, even if you’re not sure that it’s the right thing to do. It is. Holding things in will only make things more difficult, so out with it already.

"
351,9 july 2019,taurus,"Talk is cheap, so make sure that your words count. Don’t make promises that you can’t keep. On the flip side, be wary of other people trying to get you to do things their way. This includes signing contracts or agreeing to some course of action. If possible, wait until Thursday before making key decisions.

"
352,10 july 2019,taurus,"Right now you have the ability to get along with everyone, even people who aren’t your type! This is a good thing because team work counts for a lot in the weeks ahead. The last thing you need are people trying to block your progress.

"
353,11 july 2019,taurus,"If anyone gives you a head time today, chances are you’re going to charge at them like a raging bull! Unpredictable Uranus is agitated, it’s in Taurus, and it doesn’t want to take any guff. The good news is that this passes by tomorrow.

"
354,12 july 2019,taurus,"Put your home life first this weekend, Taurus. Even if your family lives far away or you don’t have a Significant Other, at least spend some quality time on yourself. The next 48 hours are excellent for chilling out and doing some inner work on your psyche too.

"
355,13 july 2019,taurus,"Enough already! You’ve been carrying too much emotional baggage and it’s time to let it go. But just thinking happy thoughts and repeating affirmations isn’t going to work. You need to see yourself as a “bigger” person, too chill to even care about some of this nonsense. The eclipse on Tuesday will help you do that.

"
356,14 july 2019,taurus,"The opinionated bloviators will be out in force today, and it could be easy to get caught up in a war of words with them. But is it worth it? Probably not. With so much planetary energy circulating through your house of optimism and living large, you don’t have time for egotistical chumps.

"
357,15 july 2019,taurus,"The word “passion” conjures up so many things: excitement, desire, optimism and a willingness to try new things. You’ve got passion in spades today as the two most spirited orbs in the solar system–Jupiter and the Moon—meet up. Take this wonderful energy and run with it.

"
358,16 july 2019,taurus,"Yee-ha! A luscious lunar eclipse occurs in the most free wheeling part of your chart. If you’ve been pining to get any from restrictive circumstances, this is your moment. And if you’ve been working on something big… a manuscript, business launch, epic voyage, graduate degree…things are going to come together nicely.

"
359,17 july 2019,taurus,"You may feel like bending the rules. You could try to convince yourself that this is what visionaries do. The problem is, even the most creative thinkers and doers on the planet still need to operate within a system. Remember that and you’ll do fine.

"
360,18 july 2019,taurus,"Your powers of persuasion are off the charts, so use this to your advantage! You won’t have to be forceful either. Charm will work better than shows of strength. And all areas of your life can benefit–your romance, career, friendships and family relationships.

"
361,19 july 2019,taurus,"Life becomes a lot livelier now that chatty Mercury is in your house of expression and socializing. But old issues with close connections could come back, demanding to be resolved. If you need to talk things over with people, get it done between now and the 31st.

"
362,20 july 2019,taurus,"A battle may erupt as people think that their opinions are the only correct ones! Be wary about taking a “my way or the highway” approach. And if anyone tries to push you into following their agenda, back away as politely as possible.

"
363,21 july 2019,taurus,"This is one of the best times in 2019 to get your point across to someone who needs to hear it. The Sun meets up with Mercury in your communication sector, giving you the gift of gab. You could win people over in your personal life or make big splash in your professional one. Don’t hold back!

"
364,22 july 2019,taurus,"It’s high time that you spent some quality moments with loved ones….or even just alone be yourself, recharging your batteries! It will be easy to do now that the Sun is in Leo, the part of your chart that encourages you to nest. Over the next four weeks you could also make important decisions about where to live and with whom. Want to redecorate? Then wait til Saturday, when Venus–planet of beauty–enters this sector.

"
365,23 july 2019,taurus,"Your sensitivity to others’ needs—and your own–is heightened by a Moon-Mars connection. It’s a big-hearted energy, one that will help you find inner peace. People may need your assistance, so don’t hold back from helping them. You will be at the right place at the right time.

"
366,24 july 2019,taurus,"The lines of communication open wide, thanks to a happy Mercury-Venus aspect. With so many planets currently in your house of family, home and romance, you should make an effort to work things out with loved ones. But you can also use this energy to self-promote and socialize.

"
367,25 july 2019,taurus,"Passion may be overtaking your mind, making you wonder if you’re operating too much on emotions. You’re not! It’s due to a wonderful Mars-Jupiter trine. These orbs are activating the paths of your chart that enable you to dig deep into your psyche. It’s all about living life to the fullest and feeling content about it. Don’t be afraid to show the world how ardent you are.

"
368,26 july 2019,taurus,"You’re a grounded soul, not one to take unnecessary risks. But an interesting Mars-Saturn aspect helps you push just a teensy bit past your comfort zone, which is perfectly OK. As a matter of fact, it’s smart. Keep taking these baby steps one day at time. In a few months you’ll be in a different place and you’ll get there without crashing and burning.

"
369,27 july 2019,taurus,"The urge to nest at home gets even stronger now that Venus is in your domestic sector. Since this glittering orb governs beauty and comfort, it’s time to update your place. Even off you’re on a tight budget you should do what it takes to make home base serene and chic. Declutter, deep clean and decorate.

"
370,28 july 2019,taurus,"It’s perfectly OK to let out your emotions, Taurus! As a matter of fact, it’s essential that you do so right now. Chiron, the Wounded Healer, wants to bring your life into balance. The first place to start is with your psyche. Then work on relationships with your family. Career, health, money….they can wait a bit. Balance doesn’t happen  overnight.

"
371,29 july 2019,taurus,"Old childhood patterns and memories could come roaring back, the kind that get you worked up. While this may be annoying, it’s part of a healing process that your heart and soul are going through right now. Just let it wash through you. The cosmic skies are calmer tomorrow.

"
372,30 july 2019,taurus,"People may be expecting more from you than you’re willing to give. So carefully consider it if you’re asked to do more. You may need to set some boundaries, and people won’t hesitate to lay guilt on you. Remind them diplomatically that you need to take care of your own interests.

"
373,31 july 2019,taurus,"Say hallelujah, say amen. Mercury has gone direct in your communications sector, ending two plus weeks of gaffes and unclear messages. Your thinking should become clearer as well. Take this energy and run with it, because now you can negotiate, self promote and socialize like crazy!

"
374,1 august 2019,taurus,"The Leo new moon puts family and residential matters first…but are you on board with what’s going on? Disagreements could occur about where to live, or with whom. Family members could be butting into your personal business, especially the romantic kind. With fiery Uranus active in Taurus, you aren’t going to roll over and play dead, that’s for sure. Let others know that your opinion WILL be heard.

"
375,2 august 2019,taurus,"People are going to rub you the wrong way….but are they really doing anything wrong? Erratic Uranus is active in your sign, making you overly active to the outside world. Take a deep breath and count to ten before you say or do anything that you might regret. Tomorrow the Moon glides into the most playful part of your chart, so why not wait this out?

"
376,3 august 2019,taurus,"Oh yeah! The weekend is here and the Moon is in Virgo, your house of flirting and having fun. Take advantage of this light hearted energy. You’ve been working hard and you’ve earned some down time. As August progresses you’ll have your mind on more practical matters; all the more reason to play right now.

"
377,4 august 2019,taurus,"Change can come easy or it can come hard. It can happen fast or at a snail’s pace. With the two most obstinate planets–Mars and Pluto–trying to push you out of your comfort zone, you might expect a rough ride. These guys aren’t subtle; actually they’re usually quite forceful. But today they’re forming a bromance, so things will happen with greater ease.

"
378,5 august 2019,taurus,"Getting everyone in a group to work better as a team isn’t impossible, Taurus…but it will require some finessing on your part. That’s OK. Thanks to Jupiter in the most optimistic part of your chart, you’ll be able to point out the big picture to everyone.

"
379,6 august 2019,taurus,"With spunky Uranus active in your sign, you may feel as though you can do it all. But you can’t and you shouldn’t. Let others do their share and keep them in the loop. Besides, they’ll be able to provide you with sage advice when the time comes.

"

Just avoid people who will try to tell you that “it can’t be done”. What the hell do they know? If they’re going to try to hold you back, then maybe they shouldn’t be along for the ride.

"
476,12 april 2019,gemini,"Someone could be critical today, or maybe they’re not acting like a team player. Who cares? You’ve got bigger fish to fry. With so much activity in your house of ambition, you won’t really notice the buzz kill types.

"
477,13 april 2019,gemini,"People could be in a pissy, petty mood today. But don’t let this interrupt the flow of your precious chi. Just avoid known trouble makers and hang out with people who respect you. There’s a lot of fun to be had this weekend if you surround yourself with the right kind of people.

"
478,14 april 2019,gemini,"Two fabulous aspects today encourage you to enjoy the company of other people over the next 48 hours. This could be with a lover, friends or industry types. Some amazing partnerships could develop, and you might end up being transformed as a result. It’s all good.

"
479,15 april 2019,gemini,"A Jupiter-Venus square could bring out the stubborn side of people. Being diplomatic and understanding may not work, so don’t let this situation bother you. By Wednesday the energy changes and people will be more amenable to your common sense.

"
480,16 april 2019,gemini,"Wishy washy behavior from others could find you scratching your head in confusion. Don’t expect this to go away today; wait 24 hours. Tomorrow verbal Mercury enters your house of teamwork, enabling you to deal with people diplomatically.

"
481,17 april 2019,gemini,"Choose your friends wisely, Gemini. Now that shrewd Mercury is in your house of friends and colleagues, you should only surround yourself with people who back you up 100%. The people you know could be instrumental in changing your life in ways that you simply can’t imagine right now.

"
482,18 april 2019,gemini,"Your emotions could go all over the place due to a Moon-Pluto square. It’s frustrating, because you’ve been trying to keep your thoughts and feelings in a more positive place. This is just a temporary situation, though. Once the Sun rolls into Taurus on Saturday it will be far easier to make progress.

"
483,19 april 2019,gemini,"Feeling mushy and romantic? It’s not surprising with the full moon occurring in your fifth house of amour. But despite the warm and fuzzy vibes going on you could still feel a tad independent. But this is a good thing. Since when has clinginess ever been attractive?

"
484,20 april 2019,gemini,"The Sun enters the quietest, more secretive part of your chart. The next four weeks are an amazing time for rest and recuperation. It’s also wise to do some much needed inner work, releasing negative habits and thoughts. But you won’t be doing this all by yourself. Gentle Venus glides into your house of friends today. Don’t be afraid to lean on them for comfort and advice.

"
485,21 april 2019,gemini,"Even though aggressive Mars is in your sign, you still need to be a team player. Today is a smart time to cooperate with others due to a Moon-Mercury trine. However, there is a part of you that you intend to keep to yourself. Not everyone needs to know your deepest secrets.

"
486,22 april 2019,gemini,"Sometimes emotional healing takes years on a therapist’s couch. Other times it can happen in an instant. A very cathartic Sun-Uranus aspect brings rapid realizations, the desire to change and a deep sense of contentment. Amen.

"
487,23 april 2019,gemini,"Jupiter is the planet of abundance, and today it forms a perfect aspect with the emotional Moon in your house of commitment. Your outlook towards love will become sunnier. It’s important to feel as though you have some say as to what is going on in a romance, so don’t be afraid to speak up.

"
488,24 april 2019,gemini,"Hold onto your heart… and your wallet! Mighty Pluto begins to retrograde in your eighth house of net worth and serious intimacy. This could actually be quite cathartic, as Pluto is like a phoenix rising from the ashes. You will need to take a good long look at how you handle your relationship with love and money.

"
489,25 april 2019,gemini,"You’re playing for keeps! It doesn’t matter if we’re talking about love or money, you’re pretty serious about your decisions. And why not? With assertive Mars in your sign, you’re starting to fixate on what’s most important.

"
490,26 april 2019,gemini,"Pay attention to your intuition, Gemini. It’s on target. But a lunar aspect could make you feel as though you know better, which could make you take unnecessary risks. Play it conservative for now.

"
491,27 april 2019,gemini,"You will not be in the mood for wishy washy people who can’t make up their minds. Nor are you going to settle for nebulous situations. However, trying to force issues or people won’t work. Sometimes you just have to sit tight and wait for amore answers, and this is one of those times.

"
492,28 april 2019,gemini,"Discipline is not the same thing as karma, Gemini. You’re not stuck living a pre-ordained life that doesn’t suit you. But changing your circumstances often requires discipline and hard work. Know the difference between these two and you’ll gain wisdom.

"
493,29 april 2019,gemini,"Drama, begone! Now that stern Saturn is retrograde in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, it’s time to reflect on how you handle certain people and situations. This is especially true when it comes to romance. Over the next few months you are going to grow up a lot, becoming calmer and more at peace with yourself.

"
494,30 april 2019,gemini,"People could be talking in circles today, something that won’t sit well with you. It will be even more annoying if it’s someone who’s a decision maker, or someone you’re relying on to get things done. Keep your emotions under control and don’t let this get to you.

"
495,1 may 2019,gemini,"“It’s not what you know, it’s who you know that counts.” Gemini, that old saying means a lot due to a Mercury-Mars meet up. With aggressive Mars in the networking part of your chart, you should be doing everything possible to meet new people and reconnect with others. Work it, honey.

"
496,2 may 2019,gemini,"Guilt, fear, bribery….yup, people will be ready to use whatever “weapon” they can today. But you’re not stupid enough to fall for it. Just keep your Spidey sense turned up high, because people are going to use emotion and drama to get their way. Some may be more subtle than others.

"
497,3 may 2019,gemini,"Friends, lovers and colleagues could be quite lucky for you today, so keep your cell phone powered up! You never know who might send that winning text your way. Make a point to get out there and circulate.

"
498,4 may 2019,gemini,"Ready for some emotional and psychological healing? The new moon takes place in the secluded, restful house of closure. Logical Mercury glides into this sector on Monday, so you are in an excellent position to do some much needed inner work. Seek the help of a professional or a confidante if you need it.

"
499,5 may 2019,gemini,"Pushy Mars is in your sign, and it could be making you quite assertive. Aggressive even. This is not necessarily a good state to be in, especially today with Mars opposing Jupiter. You run the risk of trying to lay down the law with someone close. Don’t go there, because it will backfire. Wait until Thursday to make your move.

"
500,6 may 2019,gemini,"Right now you’re looking like the most psychic of all the twelve sings, which means that you’re armed and extremely dangerous! Seriously, you should be using this energy to your (secret) advantage. Shrewd Mercury just entered the house of the subconscious mind, joining the Sun and Uranus. Go ahead and snoop.

"
501,7 may 2019,gemini,"You may be tempted to cut someone slack, but is that wise? You know what they say: give someone an inch, they’ll take a mile. This is true in personal relationships as well as professional ones. Don’t be afraid to draw a line in the sand.

"
502,8 may 2019,gemini,"Sshhhh!! Your best work will be done behind the scenes today. Shrewd Mercury meets up with genius Uranus in your house of confidentiality. It’s an excellent day to look for another job or research starting up your own business. Snoop the competition, develop a new product line, but whatever you do, keep it on the down low.

"
503,9 may 2019,gemini,"It pays to be cooperative and work well with others, both in your personal and professional lives. Does this mean that everyone is going to be friendly and chipper? No it does not. But don’t let that get in your way. Rise above their petty behavior and be the true class act that you are.

"
504,10 may 2019,gemini,"Square peg in a round hole? You may feel as though you don’t fit in, or that others don’e share your ideals. But that’s OK. Tomorrow begins a number of wonderful aspects that will lat for several weeks, in which you will realize that you don’t have  to fit in! A healing, peaceful time is ahead. Namaste.

"
505,11 may 2019,gemini,"You could come to some quiet decisions today about matters with far reaching consequences. This shouldn’t be a painful process either, but a peaceful one. You’re stepping into a place of greater personal power and it shows.

"
506,12 may 2019,gemini,"Your sign is famous for the ability to communicate but today you can outdo yourself. A positive Moon-Venus trine allows you to get the words out in an eloquent manner….without a show of force! Getting people around to your way of thinking is possible, which means that they’re also more likely to do what you want (another bonus).

"
507,13 may 2019,gemini,"You’re in secret agent mode today, always an interesting place to be. A meeting of the illuminating Sun and probing Pluto allows you to dig deep.  Sure, you could snoop your lover’s text messages on their phone, but this energy is better spent in other ways. Use it to improve your finances, health or mental state, anything that’s really significant.

"
508,14 may 2019,gemini,"You can get a point across to someone without a lot of force, Gemini. With assertive Mars in your sign you run the risk of being too pushy these days. But a terrific Mars-Venus trine enables you to speak your piece with grace. Keep this in mind for the rest of the week, as the energy continues.

"
509,15 may 2019,gemini,"It’s time to become stealthier, Gemini! Venus glides into your mysterious twelfth house of research, soul-searching and confidentiality. At the same time her companion Mars enters the house of creating stability, which includes love and money. Do what’s needed to shore up the foundations of your life without making big announcements about it.

"
510,16 may 2019,gemini,"Personal decisions can be made with a lot of fanfare, or they can be so subtle that others don’t even know what you’re up to. A positive (yet secretive) Mercury-Saturn aspect enables you to get in touch with your deepest emotions and make serious decisions that come from the heart…with some logic thrown in for good measure.

"
511,17 may 2019,gemini,"Just how many close connections do you need to have in your life? Some people pride themselves on the number of people they know; others prefer to keep a close coterie of intimate confidantes. Consider what works best for you.

"
512,18 may 2019,gemini,"You really  need to start taking better care of yourself, Gemini. The full moon takes place in your house of habits and health. Uranus is practically yelling at you to slow down, chill out and walk away from responsibilities (or people) that are weighing you down. It’s time for some extreme self-care, but it starts with you. Treat your body and mind as though they are a temple.

"
513,19 may 2019,gemini,"How’s your health, Gemini? The Sun spends a few more days in your house of physical and mental well being before it enters your sign. Now’s the time to take care of diet, fitness or ailment issues. Your birthday season is almost here and you need to be firing on all cylinders.

"
514,20 may 2019,gemini,"Don’t expect people in your world to follow a strict set of rules that you’ve created, or that society believes in. Deal with people from your heart first. When the Sun enters your sign tomorrow you’ll start to loosen up a bit.

"
515,21 may 2019,gemini,"Yippee kiyay! Your birthday season officially begins, and this year it’s extra special. The Sun just entered your sign, and so did vivacious Mercury. These two are forming a bromance as they pass through your sign over the next few weeks. El Sol solidifies your authority and independence, while Mercury increases your brain power. Today is a great time to create a bucket list for the year ahead.

"
516,22 may 2019,gemini,"Your subconscious mind will be hyperactive over the next 48 hours, and this is a good  thing. It could provide you with a solution to a problem that has been vexing you, or ideas for a brand new way of living. The bottom line is that if you act on these ideas, your life will feel a lot more stable–and therefore your emotions will too.

"
517,23 may 2019,gemini,"Chasing after the almighty dollar may not be worth it if your values are out of sync, Gemini. Today is a good time to put thought into what you’re doing for a living and why. Money isn’t everything; peace of mind and happiness count for a lot too.

"
518,24 may 2019,gemini,"You can’t trust your judgment today, Gemini. Period. A Moon-Venus square indicates that you will be operating on pure emotion and not logic, which is not a good thing. Keep your opinions to yourself. It may take a good week for the cosmic skies to clear, so don’t make any major decisions until then.

"
519,25 may 2019,gemini,"If life has become a bit….(yawn) predictable, it’s time to shake things up. Thanks to the moon in the feistiest part of your chart, you’ll have no trouble dreaming up ways to be more bold. You only live once, Gemini. Make the most of it.

"
520,26 may 2019,gemini,"Don’t feel as though you’re being selfish by taking some “alone time”. You truly need it. This doesn’t mean that you should cut out friends or people who mean a lot to you. Just make sure that you’re surrounding yourself right now with people who fill you up, not the kind who drain you.

"
521,27 may 2019,gemini,"Recently it may have seemed as though other people had the upper hand. Maybe you were thinking that you would never be able to get ahead or gain some control. Persistence pays off, my friend. A wonderful lunar aspect helps put you on a level playing field.

"
522,28 may 2019,gemini,"It will be difficult to figure out what people are saying and thinking today, Gemini. And with your hyperactive brain, you will be going into overdrive trying to figure them out. Don’t waste your time. The bottom line is that they’re confused. When they eventually gain clarity, so will you.

"
523,29 may 2019,gemini,"Sometimes being straightforward and open can work against you, and today is one of those times. A Mercury-Neptune square warns you to say little, especially at the job or when dealing with authority figures. Pay attention to what they’re saying and doing instead. Neptune is blowing a lot of fog around; you’ll need to be at your perceptive best to figure out what muckety mucks are up to.

"
524,30 may 2019,gemini,"It looks like you’re going to have to be the voice of reason today, Gemini. People may be overly optimistic about things, or unable to come up with a logical thought and plan. If a situation or relationship looks like it’s going off the rails, then step in and be the boss.

"
525,31 may 2019,gemini,"Feeling like a sexy secret agent? An international man of mystery (“the name is Bond, James Bond”)? Or a deliciously saucy femme fatale? You can thank a Venus-Neptune trine for this delightful state of affairs (and I do mean affairs). If you really want to work this energy, though, leave something to the imagination. Don’t put all your goods on display. Keep ’em guessing.

"
526,1 june 2019,gemini,"You’re better off right now being the power behind the throne rather than being on center stage. It’s a better strategy to do your thing quietly. This will throw off competitors, trolls and anyone else who’d like to see you fall flat on your face. It certainly will be fun having the last laugh, won’t it?

"
527,2 june 2019,gemini,"You’re pretty much done  with vague promises and situations that aren’t right for you. And the good thing is that you’re ready to do something about it. But before you dive in, spend some quiet time alone and think things through. Better yet, tap into your intuition, which is pretty strong right now.

"
528,3 june 2019,gemini,"Woo-hoo! Today’s new Moon occurs in Gemini, placing your dreams on center stage. If you’re willing to hustle, you can make terrific headway by December. There is some wonky energy, however, surrounding this lunation. Financial and romantic matters can shine, as long as  you keep things private or confidential. The other issue is that you can’t give your power over to someone else. A lover, boss or business partner could try to push you in a direction that you don’t want to go in.

"
529,4 june 2019,gemini,"Shrewd Mercury enters your money sector, a beneficial event. Red hot Mars has been there for some time, which could have spurred you to spend more money than is reasonable. Mercury’s logical thinking will balance Mars’s assertiveness. Don’t forget, Mars is the great motivator….use its energy wisely to further your financial situation.

"
530,5 june 2019,gemini,"Motivator Mars fires you up to create stronger foundations in your life, at all levels. You’re starting to realize that you can’t go on living in limbo. Nor is it your karma to be handed the table scraps of life. A positive mental shift is occurring, so take it and run with it.

"
531,6 june 2019,gemini,"Some people like to shove their sex appeal in everyone’s faces with boobs hanging out of their blouses or tight pants that leave nothing to the imagination (“Is that a sock?”). But not you, Gemini. Glamorous, seductive Venus is in the most hidden part of your chart, allowing you to be sexy and classy at the same time.

"
532,7 june 2019,gemini,"Anyone who thinks that you’re a pushover is in for a big surprise. You are going to hang on tenaciously to your position or desires. But don’t make a big production out of this; keep your determination under wraps.

"
533,11 june 2019,gemini,"The Sun in your sign is making you quite independent, and rational too. Which is precisely why you’re going to have a problem with people who want to blow smoke up your tuckus. People may not be intentionally trying to deceive you, but they could be overly optimistic about where things are going. Keep it real, even if that pisses them off.Gemini

"
534,12 june 2019,gemini,"Damn, you’re motivated! A meeting of Mars and the North Node of the Moon fires you up to start creating more stability in your life. You might want to start with money and romance, as they are well favored right now.The most important thing to realize is that you’re not stuck in a particular situation.

"
535,13 june 2019,gemini,"You’re not one to follow the crowd, at least not this week! With the Sun in your sign you should be feeling more independent than usual. If anyone tries to rein you in, politely let them know that you’re perfectly happy being exactly who you are.

"
536,14 june 2019,gemini,"Live for the moment, Gemini! From your chart it appears that you’re getting too bogged down in the future. Quit trying so hard to predict outcomes and stage manage everything that’s going on. Loosen up a little bit and enjoy the process instead.

"
537,15 june 2019,gemini,"When the going gets tough, the tough get going….and its time for you to take that attitude! Quit selling yourself short, thinking that you don’t have the brains or the brawn to pull something off. You do, and your rivals will be left in the dust.

"
538,16 june 2019,gemini,"Sometimes the path ahead isn’t a straight line; it’s full of twists and turns and detours. But that can often be the best way to get to a destination. Don’t be too anxious to get ahead, Gemini. Things may not seem straightforward to you  now, but in the end you’ll realize why things had to take time.

"
539,17 june 2019,gemini,"Romantic matters could be murky, and tonight’s full moon is trying to shed light on them. The problem is that foggy Neptune is in a tough angle to the Moon, making it hard to know what’s going on. The same holds true for business relationships. Wait until the Sun enters Cancer this Friday for more clarity.

"
540,18 june 2019,gemini,"It’s a great day for planning the future thanks to a Saturn-Neptune aspect. Saturn helps us make good long term decisions, while Neptune opens our eyes to fresh possibilities. This week is better for planning than taking action, though, as tomorrow brings some cosmic storms.

"
541,19 june 2019,gemini,"The bloviators are out there today, and they may be trying to get you to part with your money. It’s also possible that an employer, client, lawyer or someone else will play hard ball, trying to get you to accept terms that aren’t worth it. Keep calm and carry on, because the Sun enters your money house on Friday.

"
542,20 june 2019,gemini,"Keep big ideas to yourself, Gemini. The idea stealers are out there, along with the Debbie Downers.  You also need to protect the secrets of others, which includes trade or industry information. Once Mercury changes signs on Wednesday the 26th you can open up a little bit.

"
543,21 june 2019,gemini,"The Sun enters your income zone, which should be good news when it comes to landing more money. The issue is that Neptune starts to retrograde in your career zone at the same time. What this means is that you need to slow down and consider all of your options carefully. Don’t rush into anything until you have all of the facts.

"
544,22 june 2019,gemini,"The Moon enters Pisces, the part of your chart that loves the luxe life. This is a good weekend for treating yourself to a nice treat (without breaking the bank, though!). Romance sizzles too, and the time is right for lining up a more defined future.

"
545,23 june 2019,gemini,"Promises, promises! People might make them, but will they follow through? With a Venus-Jupiter opposition things may look good on the surface, but you need to do some digging to see if they’re legit. And make sure that you’re not making agreements that you can’t deliver on either.

"
546,24 june 2019,gemini,"Trying to get a straight answer from someone—especially a decision maker—could be tough. Neptune is swirling its mist, indicating that people could be confused or worse—deceptive. Thursday rocks for getting down to business, so if possible, wait until then. Your intuition will be just as strong as your logic.

"
547,25 june 2019,gemini,"Perhaps you’re tired of playing nice and doing things to appease other people. If that’s the case, a lunar aspect will help you assert more independence. Better yet is that verbal Mercury enters your house of communicating tomorrow. You’ll have plenty to say!

"
548,26 june 2019,gemini,"Talk much? Your sign is famous for gabbing and thinking and now you have the cosmos’s permission to do just that. Verbal Mercury is now in your house of communicating. If you have a message to get out there, do it before July 7th when the messenger planet goes retrograde.

"
549,27 june 2019,gemini,"Getting rid of a bad habit or way of thinking could be a snap today, Gemini! No twelve-step program, no years on a therapist’s couch. Sometimes change happens in an instant. If you’re willing to be open to that idea, metamorphosis can occur.

"
550,28 june 2019,gemini,"The next 48 hours have a restful, healing energy about them. On an emotional and physical level, it’s time to start feeling better. The solar eclipse on July 3rd falls your house of habits, and it will kickstart a brand new chapter in which you can create smarter routines. Discipline will bring you results.

"
551,29 june 2019,gemini,"Some interesting news could come your way, or a winner of an idea. If that’s the case you shouldn’t hesitate to take action. Some research may need to be done first but that’s a smart thing to do.

"
552,30 june 2019,gemini,"You may need to be the voice of reason today, so be prepared to lay down the law. Others may be operating on pure hope and fantasy, never a good thing! Bring them down to Earth as diplomatically as possible.

"
553,1 july 2019,gemini,"Can we talk? Megamouth Mars enters your communications sector, turning you into someone to be recognized! Use this special planetary energy to socialize and catch up with friends. Flirt like a pro. Promote your resume or brand. Go on the lecture circuit or become a consultant. Just take note: Mercury is in this house too and it goes retrograde on the 7th.

"
554,2 july 2019,gemini,"Money talks and it’s practically screaming at you today. It’s time to get a lot more serious about planning for the future. Conservative Saturn is in your net worth sector, telling you to develop better saving and investing habits.

"
555,3 july 2019,gemini,"No more shaky situations for you, Gemini. A solar eclipse in one of the most solid parts of your chart demands answers and guarantees. This is true in your romantic life as well as your financial one. Between now and December you can create better circumstances for yourself. The key is to think long term, not just about the near future. If you have any doubts about whether a person or situation can go the distance, then walk away.

"
556,4 july 2019,gemini,"Yesterday’s solar eclipse occurred in your money house, so it’s time to go after more cash. But from your chart it appears that you may feel stuck, as if you couldn’t possibly do something different with your career. Stern Saturn is in your net worth sector, and it demands that you do things conservatively. However, that doesn’t mean that you have to remain in the same job or field. Be open to fresh ideas.

"
557,5 july 2019,gemini,"Great day to release pent-up emotions and ideas, safely and calmly. With the Moon in your house of talking and connecting, this is the moment to let others know what’s going on in that head of yours. Do it now because Mercury is going to go retrograde here on Sunday!

"
558,6 july 2019,gemini,"Spending time with family and loved ones is what counts with the Moon in Virgo. Try to get any issues out to the way today, if you can—Mercury starts to retrograde tomorrow in your house of communicating!

"
559,7 july 2019,gemini,"You really  need to watch your words, Gemini! Big mouth Mars is in your house of thinking, speaking and writing. Mercury is there too, and today it goes retrograde. This doesn’t last long: it’s over on the 19th. But you don’t want to say anything that you’ll regret, so think before you speak.

"
560,8 july 2019,gemini,"Pay attention to your own wisdom today rather than relying on the advice of others. They may get offended that you’re not listening to them, but it’s your life, babe. With the Sun in Cancer you’r coming from a very logical place.

"
561,9 july 2019,gemini,"Tighten your belt, Gemini. It’s time to play closer attention to your finances and plan for the long term.  A Sun-Saturn opposition demands maturity and discipline. The good news is that an auspicious trine on Thursday could help you earn more.

"
562,10 july 2019,gemini,"It seems like everyone wants a piece of you these days, and that’s a good thing! But before you “spread the wealth”, so to speak, you should consider just who and what you’re giving your time to. Not everyone should be in the loop.

"
563,11 july 2019,gemini,"Watch your temper and watch out even more with your words. An aggressive Mars-Uranus square could prompt you to say or text something you might regret. You might also realize that someone is not all they’re cracked up to be. It’s best to keep this observation to yourself for now.

"
564,12 july 2019,gemini,"The next 48 hours are wonderful for socializing thanks to a Moon-Venus connection. There is so much planetary activity in your career sector this month; make sure that you take some down time. Romantic alliances can also do well right now!

"
565,13 july 2019,gemini,"Oooh la la! The passionate Moon meets up with lucky, generous Jupiter in your house of serious love. Make this a special date night (or all day event) with your sweetie. No sweetie in sight? Then circulate in your local neighborhood, as lusty Mars and amorous Venus are in this sector.

"
566,14 july 2019,gemini,"Money matters are developing momentum thanks to an upcoming eclipse in your wealth sector on Tuesday. Watch out for anyone who is playing hard ball, trying to get you to do something that might benefit them more than it will help you. This could be a stock broker, real estate agent, attorney, potential boss or client or banker. Maybe it’s even someone with whom you share assets. Look out for #1, my friend.

"
567,15 july 2019,gemini,"It’s a wonderful day for teaming up with people you love…..and maybe even someone you’d like to have as a romantic partner! A juicy Moon-Jupiter conjunction brings out your best. Jupiter is also known for doling out some luck here and there, so something unusual but positive could happen.

"
568,16 july 2019,gemini,"A major celestial event occurs today—a lunar eclipse in your eighth house of deep emotions and net worth. Yup: sex, intimacy and investments and “unearned” money are all in the same house, which makes this one loaded sector. And because lunar eclipses are full moons, something could be coming to a close. This can go either way, depending on what’s going on in your life: breaking up or getting engaged. A court award could go your way, or not. The key right now is to focus on long term ramifications, not on what you want today.

"
569,17 july 2019,gemini,"Trying to wiggle out of a situation won’t work, Gemini! You’re better off facing the issue head on. Passive aggressive games, “poor little me” routines, putting on the charm offensive–forget about it. Keep things real. People will respect you more for that.

"
570,18 july 2019,gemini,"Go posh or go home! A lovely Venus-Neptune trine tells you that it’s perfectly OK to pamper yourself and/or a loved one. (Gotta love it when the cosmos tells you to splurge, even if just a little bit). So book a manicure or a massage, dine in a more upscale cafe, or treat yourself to some new clothes. Keep it affordable and enjoy yourself.

"
571,19 july 2019,gemini,"Mercury retrogrades back into your income sector, reviving issues that may have come up earlier in the year. This is actually a good thing: the boss may be willing to give you a raise, or a company that had a hiring freeze awhile back may now be able to employ you. But you should also be reviewing your expenses and savings to see where you can improve your habits.

"
572,20 july 2019,gemini,"How should you handle things: should you come on strong or be laid back? That’s the question posed by today’s Pluto-Venus opposition. The reality is that neither approach will work right now; you need to find a middle ground. Once the Sun enters Leo on Monday you’ll gain more clarity and be able to express yourself better.

"
573,21 july 2019,gemini,"This is the last day that the Sun will be in your income house, so take advantage of it! In a sweet cosmic coincidence, El Sol forms a perfect aspect with shrewd negotiator Mercury. Ask for the raise, the job or the business. Seek out new and better ways of making money. Cut deals and self promote. It’s all good.

"
574,22 july 2019,gemini,"A match made in the heavens for people of the Gemini persuasion: the Sun enters Leo, your house of socializing! Over the next four weeks you should be partying and networking like crazy. Short distance trips are highly favored, as is romance. The cosmic lovers–Mars and Venus—will both be in this sector as of Saturday, so get ready for amour.

"
575,23 july 2019,gemini,"Your social life picks up momentum! High octane Mars and the passionate Moon are in the mood for partying, hanging out in the neighborhood or going on a quick trip out of town. Singles, you could meet someone locally, so dress to impress—even if you’re going to the laundromat.

"
576,24 july 2019,gemini,"You could be in quite a generous mood as diplomatic Mercury and loving Venus meet up in the heavens. Just make sure that you’re not SO generous that you’re going to be taken advantage of. People need to be worthy (and grateful!) of  your kindness.

"
577,25 july 2019,gemini,"If you have something to say to someone, or a message you want to get out to the world at large, now is the time to do it. Some terrific aspects occur over the next four days will enable you to be spot on. Today red hot Mars in your communicating sector forms an alliance with lucky Jupiter in your partnership zone. Business and romantic relationships will benefit big time.

"
578,26 july 2019,gemini,"Tone down your words and try to keep emotions out of the picture, Gemini. A Mars-Saturn aspect demands more logical thought than just going on feelings. That’s OK, you’ll get your dose of the feels. Tomorrow Venus enters the most expressive part of your chart.

"
579,27 july 2019,gemini,"Phew. Thank heavens that Venus is now in your house of self expression. To be honest, you were running the risk of coming on too strong, due to the fiery Sun and aggressive Mars already in this sector. Now you can get further with charm and diplomacy. Go ahead, work your magic!

"
580,28 july 2019,gemini,"Any doubts that you’ve had about being able to pull something off start to disappear! I’m not talking about pulling off a bank heist. I’m referring to some kind of dream that seems farfetched, something that takes you out of your comfort zone. You’re starting to realize that you do have the chops to go for it. And whatever you don’t know, you’ll learn along the way.

"
581,29 july 2019,gemini,"What’s going on there??!!  Your brain might be working on overdrive, dreaming up problems and dramas that don’t have any basis in reality. So stop playing psychic super sleuth, because your sixth sense isn’t worth a damn today. Chill out and let things go.

"
582,30 july 2019,gemini,"It my seem as though other people have the upper hand, but that’s not a problem for your clever sign! With motivator Mars in your house of communicating, you’ll be able to get your point across with charm. Better yet, your words will inspire people to think differently….about you and what you have to say.

"
583,31 july 2019,gemini,"Woo-hoo! Mercury goes direct in your house of income and savings. Raises and job offers that were held up should start to move forward. So should negotiations with clients and increasing business revenues. This energy lasts til August 11th, so make the most of it.

"
584,1 august 2019,gemini,"The Leo new moon opens up a brand new social season for you, one in which you should  be wining and dining and schmoozing. And networking for business, cutting deals and promoting your brand. So why are you holding back? Hmmm…it’s probably due to Uranus, which is making you doubt yourself. Or it could be that you don’t completely trust the people around you and need to feel them out first, which is a smart move.

"
585,2 august 2019,gemini,"The trolls and passive-aggressive types could be on the prowl today, ready to stir up their usual petty nonsense. Even a lover or close friend could act erratically. Fortunately you have gentle Venus in your house of thinking and communicating, so you won’t fly off the handle. Next week you’ll have the opportunity to put the trolls in their place.

"
586,3 august 2019,gemini,"Nesting at home is on the agenda this weekend as the Moon glides into your domestic sector. But you could also head out to the home design stores, shopping for new linens, furniture and wall coverings. August is a good time to create a sanctuary at home, like a meditation/yoga room. Don’t have that kind of space? Then put together a “shrine” on a small tabletop, dedicated to peace and personal growth.

"
587,4 august 2019,gemini,"Heaven knows you love to talk, and with megamouth Mars in your communication zone, you run the risk of coming on too strong. So consider a better way of getting your message across without sounding wimpy! You absolutely need to make a point, so don’t clam up. Just use a little more diplomacy, that’s all.

"
588,5 august 2019,gemini,"They say that flattery will get you everywhere, and sometimes that’s true. But right now you’re better off showing people that you have what it takes to make things happen. This could be at work, of course, but also within a romantic or family situation. People might be underestimating you. Show them that they’re wrong!

"
589,6 august 2019,gemini,"Your subconscious mind is a bit too overactive today, making all sorts of crazy thoughts pop into your mind. Therefore, think before you say or do anything as your intuition could be off. It may also be difficult to stick to routines and habits under this aspect. Do you really need that piece of cheesecake or double martini? No? Then stay on track.

"
590,7 august 2019,gemini,"Good heavens, you have the diplomacy of an ambassador trying to resolve an international dispute. You have the kind of salesmanship that could sell ice cream to Eskimos. Crushing it on social media is possible, along with landing a book deal or an agent. Let’s not even talk about how charismatic you are to potential suitors. Is it the perfume you’re wearing? Nope, it’s an awesome Jupiter-Sun aspect. Work it, honey. Work it good.

"
591,8 august 2019,gemini,"Long lasting love is in the stars, thanks to a delightful Sun-Venus connection. Considering that Venus is in your house of communicating, you should feel free to speak your mind about important matters. Geminis looking for love could find a keeper, and in their own town at that. No need to find someone in a different area code or time zone. As they say, “Shop local”!

"
592,9 august 2019,gemini,"Make sure that you’re congruous, Gemini. Your words and actions need to be solid. People need to feel as though they know where you’re coming from. This may require you to develop more self confidence or to switch up your image in some way. But what’s wrong with being authentic?

"
593,10 august 2019,gemini,"To your surprise you may realize that things that were important to you just aren’t anymore. It’s no big deal. It’s just that the Sun, Mars and Venus are all in the most thoughtful part of your chart, enlightening you. Inspirational Neptune is also active in your house of big dreams, so expect change. It’s for the better.

"
594,11 august 2019,gemini,"Peace at last? Erratic Uranus begins to retrograde in one of the most psychological parts of your chart, helping to quiet your overly busy mind. Jupiter resumes direct motion in your house of serious romance (hallelujah), and chatty Mercury enters your communicating sector! You can finally release pent-up thoughts and emotions in a productive way, to people who count.

"
595,12 august 2019,gemini,"You need to make some changes, Gemini. The kind that involve inner work. Your emotions and thoughts need to be calmer. Fortunately disciplined, mature Saturn forms a perfect angle with the Moon. Find a modality that works for you: meditating, journaling, seeking professional help or scheduling more free time for yourself. You’ll be happier as a result!

"
596,13 august 2019,gemini,"“Everyone is entitled to MY opinion!” Oh really? Think twice before you take this stance. Hey, your ideas and thoughts could be absolutely brilliant and 100% on point. But that doesn’t mean that people need to be reminded of that. Sometimes ya just gotta keep your genius to yourself, Gemini.

"
597,14 august 2019,gemini,"Grab your keys and head for the door, Gemini! You need to be out circulating today. A delicious Sun-Venus aspect is perfect for romance (finding it or increasing it), having cocktails with friends or schmoozing for business. Next week is going to be quite social too, so don’t get too bogged down with responsibilities. You must  enjoy this energy.

"
598,15 august 2019,gemini,"Yessss!!! The Aquarian full moon helps you dive into the more exciting part of life. It’s time to plan adventures and consider activities, philosophies and people you might not have thought were possible before. They are, and it’s up to you to chase them down.

"
599,16 august 2019,gemini,"People are saying one thing and your mind is saying another. Pay attention, though, and listen to others. Their opinions and advice may be more sound than you realize. The problem is that rebellious Uranus is active in the house of your subconscious mind, stirring up the doubting side of your brain.

"
600,17 august 2019,gemini,"Are you selling your soul for the sake of stability? Sometimes we stay in a job or relationship even if it’s lousy, because it might be better than what else is out there. (“Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.”) But years can go by, and you’ll always be wondering if there truly is a better option. Start thinking in a more visionary way, Gemini.

"
601,18 august 2019,gemini,"Home is where the heart is, and it’s where your focus will be over the next four-plus weeks. Mars has just entered Virgo, your fourth house of home and family. Other celestial orbs will follow later this week. Do you need or want to move? Redecorate? Perhaps you and a lover need to discuss living together, to starting a family of your own. Just don’t get too pushy about things, a possibility with Mars in this sector.

"
602,19 august 2019,gemini,"Take some time off for yourself and just have fun. You desperately need some down time, and with the Moon in your house of friends you should make plans with the tribe. Yes, it’s a Monday, but so what. The planets don’t follow our working schedule and they’re telling you to chill out!

"
603,20 august 2019,gemini,"Being direct and to the point could work against you today, especially in a group setting. People don’t want to hear the truth, nor are they ready for cutting edge ideas. It will take them some time to reach that point, so hold off until the time is right.

"
604,21 august 2019,gemini,"Got something to say to a lover or family member? Then today is your day. With silver tongued Mercury at your service you can settle old arguments, talk about money quietly and discuss the future without drama. You’re entering into a very content, settled place over the next few weeks, so make peace now.

"
605,22 august 2019,gemini,"Cutting through red tape and weasel words is going to be a task today, Gemini. With sharp-as-a-tack Mercury in your house of thinking, you’re focused and realistic. Problem is, others will be blowing smoke your way. Keep calm and observe rather than talking and probing. Others’ actions will speak louder than their words.

"
606,23 august 2019,gemini,"Home and family matters take center stage thanks to the Sun entering your domestic sector. Assertive Mars happens to be in this house too, making you determined to resolve housing and relationship issues. Old issues from your childhood may come bubbling up to the surface next week, but this is positive: an amazing transformation could take place on your part.

"
607,24 august 2019,gemini,"Emotions get intense as Venus and Mars meet up in Virgo, but this is a positive thing! Many Geminis will get closer to their lover, having serious talks about the future. Anything related to housing is well aspected too as Virgo is your domestic sector. It’s a sentimental, mushy time, so enjoy it.

"
608,25 august 2019,gemini,"People who seem intent on pushing your buttons need to get out of your way, Gemini. This may mean setting boundaries. Or letting them know that you’re not interested in their opinions. You’re not fated by some horrible destiny to be surrounded by people who don’t support you! Start spending more time with those who respect and love you for what you are.

"
609,26 august 2019,gemini,"A happy event could occur today or over the next week, something that will put a smile on your face. Maybe you get engaged or conceive a baby. Perhaps you hear those three little words, or realize that you’re in love with someone. There is  an air of privacy around this, so don’t feel compelled to blab about it. The time will come for going public.

"
610,27 august 2019,gemini,"Serious financial and career decisions require thought and research right now; don’t avoid it! It’s critical that you create a strong foundation for yourself when it comes to savings, investments and job prospects. Your intuition is quite strong too, so use both logic and gut hunches to move ahead.

"
611,28 august 2019,gemini,"You need to vent and you need to do it in a productive manner. Fortunately brilliant Uranus is active in the most psychological part of your chart, helping you shake off the blues. There’s no need to take other people down, even if they’ve hurt you. What counts is that you feel good inside.

"
612,29 august 2019,gemini,"Your lively sign is known for being out there socializing, but right now you could be a homebody. That’s because planets are piling up in your fourth house of domesticity. Mercury joins Mars, Venus and the Sun there today. Actually this is beneficial as it appears that you need to settle some family business, which includes letting past dramas go bye-bye.

"
613,30 august 2019,gemini,"Just how important are those dreams of yours? Is it possible that you’ve outgrown some of them? If that’s the case today’s new moon in Virgo will point this out. Maybe you’re not even sure about what you want. That’s OK and to be expected, as murky Neptune opposes the moon. By mid-September you’ll have a much clearer idea about what you truly desire.

"
614,31 august 2019,gemini,"There’s a difference between lowering your standards and changing your mind, Gemini. If something isn’t working for you anymore, there’s nothing wrong with letting it go. As long as you replace it with something that speaks to your authentic self you will be on the right path.

"
615,1 september 2019,gemini,"Inner peace: it’s so elusive, and everyone wants it. Fortunately for you, Gemini, four planets are creating soothing aspects in the most emotional and psychological parts of your chart. But this isn’t just for today: this is a powerful catharsis that can turn your life around. This energy runs for two solid weeks so take advantage of it.

"
616,2 september 2019,gemini,"Housing, family and romantic matters heat up as assertive Mars tears through your domestic sector. Mars is like a double-edged sword; it can make good things happen quickly, or it can really mess things up by creating arguments and drama! So choose wisely. This is an emotional sector and it always benefits from a little logical thinking.

"
617,3 september 2019,gemini,"Family members and loved ones need to hear what’s on your mind, Gemini. Right now you have Mercury’s eloquence and Mars’s strength working on your behalf. From your chart it appears that some decisions need to be made; situations need to be resolved. And it looks like you’re the one who’s going to get the ball rolling. As usual.

"
618,4 september 2019,gemini,"Decision makers could be dragging their feet, which could make you feel unsettled. Romantic partners could also be wishy washy. You can choose to get annoyed and freak out, or decide to not let this throw off your inner sense of balance and serenity. By tomorrow the energy changes and you’ll feel more centered.

"
619,5 september 2019,gemini,"Building a strong foundation for your future is well aspected now, Gemini. Naturally this includes finances, but it also covers romance and mental health. One of the most important things you can do is to pay attention to your own wisdom rather than the advice of others. Go within. The answers you’re seeking are there.

"
620,6 september 2019,gemini,"You’re starting to realize that you don’t have to be responsible for someone else’s feelings, work load or problems. That doesn’t mean that you’re not willing to lend them a hand. Rather, you’re not going to let them dump their sh** on you. This will mean setting boundaries, of course, but it’s necessary. You have your own problems to contend with.

"
621,1 january 2019,cancer,"Happy new year, Cancer! You (and people of the Leo persuasion) are the most likely to start a diet and fitness program and stick with it. So don’t wait…pick your poison. Figure out what exercise regimen and eating program will work best for you, and dive in.

"
622,2 january 2019,cancer,"Joining forces with others is a significant move that you can make today. The Sun and Saturn are holding a power lunch in your house of committed relationships. This includes romance, but also business alliances that can take your career much further. Singles, you’re in a great position to meet someone new, a keeper at that.

"
623,3 january 2019,cancer,"Think that you’re not smart enough? Not educated enough? You might feel that way due to a tense Mercury aspect. But nothing could be further from the truth. As a matter of fact, cosmic aspects on Friday are perfect for banishing this idea forever. Sign up for a class, listen to an informative webinar, or find a mentor who can help you.

"
624,4 january 2019,cancer,"Not everyone shares your sense of adventure, nor do they see things with your creative flair. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t associate with them. Sometimes you just have to agree to disagree!

"
625,5 january 2019,cancer,"Your closest connections are about to make a major turn tomorrow, courtesy of a solar eclipse in your house of partnerships. Fortunately you are in a practical place right now. Think long and hard about the kind of people you want to have with you on your journey. Not everyone will make the cut.

"
626,6 january 2019,cancer,"Big news in the cosmos! A solar eclipse occurs in your house of commitment, opening up doors that may have been firmly shut in the past. If you’re single and lonely, those days could be coming to an end by July. Those Cancers who are dating could see things get a lot more serious. Married crabs could experience a romantic renaissance. And with Uranus active in your house of tradition, you’re going to want things to be stable and sensible.

"
627,7 january 2019,cancer,"Sometimes getting into a good habit groove is a real challenge. Fortunately for you, Venus–planet of ease–glides into your efficiency sector today. You can make a lot of traction with your 2019 plans. Good thing too, because genius Uranus is now direct in your ambition sector.

"
628,8 january 2019,cancer,"Cooperation may be non-existent today. People may have a “my way or the highway” kind of attitude. You can let this get to you or let it slide. From your chart it appears that a boss or authority figure could be critical, so slap a smile on your face and soldier on.

"
629,9 january 2019,cancer,"You could do a 180 today, and this is a good thing. Spunky Uranus is active in your house of goals and ambition. Your passion is running high too. Why settle in life for situations that aren’t optimal? There’s nothing wrong with changing your direction.

"
630,10 january 2019,cancer,"Yum. The passionate Moon and amorous Neptune meet up in your house of romance, making today a sweet time for romance! But this also happens to be your house of creativity, so expect inspiration to be flowing in a big way.

"
631,11 january 2019,cancer,"It’s time to get serious about what you want out of a relationship. Don’t expect others to know what you’re thinking. The most important message that the cosmos has for you is to not settle. Make that clear to people who want to be in your life.

"
632,12 january 2019,cancer,"It may be the weekend but your mind will be on important long term goals and plans. Actually this is a blessing, because next week the planets will be pushing all  signs of the zodiac to make some serious decisions. You have a jump on everyone else, as the Moon and Mars meet up in your house of ambition.

"
633,13 january 2019,cancer,"Pay attention if others have advice for you. Two heads are better than one. You may be taking an unrealistic view about a particular issue; don’t be afraid to ask for advice.

"
634,14 january 2019,cancer,"If you have found it difficult lately to find common ground with someone, that’s about to change. Sometimes you need to open your mind a bit for that to happen. You’re in a more philosophical place these days, which will help you appreciate where other people are coming from.

"
635,15 january 2019,cancer,"You’re currently in a period in which your happiness and future success depends on how you interact with others. This is no time for going it alone. The good news is that the cosmos is trying to introduce you to solid new partners, professionally and personally. Be on the lookout for movers and shakers and fun people who know how to live.

"
636,16 january 2019,cancer,"Sometimes we’ve reach a point in our lives when we realize that our values have changed. This can be a sad event, or it can be incredibly uplifting. Today a lunar aspect helps you realize that you’re upping your game, which means that your values are (happily) on the way up too.

"
637,18 january 2019,cancer,"Your relationships with other people are under review, big-time. That’s because shrewd Mercury meets up with deep diving Pluto today in a conjunction. You won’t be willing to play the part of enabler anymore, or the “nice one”. You deserve respect. Claim it.

"
638,19 january 2019,cancer,"
With the Moon in your sign you should be looking out for #1. But others may be trying to ram their agendas down your throat. Forget about it! Once the Leo eclipse arrives on Monday, they’ll realize that their plans won’t work.

"
639,20 january 2019,cancer,"
This is one heck of a good week for creating more stability in your life. Today the Sun enters Aquarius, your eighth house of wealth and intimacy.  If you want to see gains when it comes to love and money, avoid thinking like the crowd. 

"
640,21 january 2019,cancer,"
Your income can take a nice leap forward over the next few months, thanks to today’s lunar eclipse in Leo. But in order to make the most of this aspect, you’re going to have to tiptoe carefully around business partners, bosses and clients. This doesn’t mean that you have to kowtow to them; just be diplomatic.

"
641,22 january 2019,cancer,"
Sometimes creating new habits and routines can be a real drag. Let’s face it… who wants to be disciplined? But a Venus-Jupiter conjunction helps you create new systems with ease. Good thing too, considering that yesterdays eclipse occurred in your house of stability.

"
642,23 january 2019,cancer,"
This is not a good day to buck the system, no matter how badly you’d love to. It may seem as though other people have the upper hand, and this can be frustrating. Don’t let it go. By Friday you’re back in charge.

"
643,24 january 2019,cancer,"
You have a reputation for being moody, but is that really the case? With logical Mercury entering your house of psychological depth, you could actually be the most chilled out person in the room. Over the next three weeks you can process old emotions that need to go.

"
644,25 january 2019,cancer,"
You won’t be fazed if faced with a big project or idea. A super Mars-Jupiter trine will encourage you to break things down into manageable chunks. You’ve heard how to eat an elephant, haven’t you? One bite at a time.

"
645,26 january 2019,cancer,"
No rest for the weary? Despite the fact that it’s the weekend you may feel as though you still are on the clock. For heaven’s sakes, forget about your job and other worries. You need to recharge your batteries.

"
646,27 january 2019,cancer,"
With the authoritative Sun in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, you’re in no mood for anyone who wants to disturb your peace. So don’t let them!  Stay away from known malcontents. Stick with the people who put a smile on your face.

"
647,28 january 2019,cancer,"
Ready to take some kind of creative risk? If you are, the results could be well worth it. Take a good long look at your circumstances. If you feel held back in any area, it’s time to reconsider your options.

"
648,29 january 2019,cancer,"
You can either let your emotions run your life or logic. And sometimes it seems that we’re often bouncing back and forth between the two. But a solid Sun-Mercury aspect today enables you to use both to your advantage.

"
649,30 january 2019,cancer,"
New Year’s Day has come and gone. So has the month of January. So if you haven’t started that diet yet, and/or the exercise program, today is a good time to get going. The passionate Moon meets up with vibrant, healing Jupiter in your house of wellness. Getting fir may be easier than you think.

"
650,31 january 2019,cancer,"
Have things gotten a little…..dull…in a relationship? From your chart it appears that you may be too stuck in “rules” and how you think things should be. Loosen up a little, Cancer! Inspirational Neptune tells you to break a few of your regulations. 

"
651,1 february 2019,cancer,"
Take a breath and count to ten. Then back away slowly from the angry person in front of you! Seriously, a Mars-Pluto square could bring out the bossy worst in folks. It could be your spouse, boss or a cop who pulls you over. Don’t rattle their cages; it’s not worth it.

"
652,2 february 2019,cancer,"
An unexpected opportunity could come your way over the next few days, and if you’re wise you’ll take advantage of it. Make sure that you have everything lined up and organized. Look the part, dress the pact, act the part.

"
653,3 february 2019,cancer,"
From your chart it appears that you need a lot more support from people in your world. Now is the time to ask for it. This includes your kids, a lover, colleagues, family members or a business partner. If you persist in going it all alone, you’ll just end up becoming more resentful.

"
654,4 february 2019,cancer,"
The new Moon in Aquarius opens doors in both love and money. Lucky Jupiter has your back, but the gas giant demands a practical attitude on your part. Be honest with yourself––if you’ve been engaging in fairy land type thinking, it has to go.

"
655,5 february 2019,cancer,"
Good news! Your head and your heart are working in unison today. Decisions can be made that are both logical and yet soothe your passionate soul. This energy carries into the weekend, so use it wisely.

"
656,6 february 2019,cancer,"
Lighten up a little, Cancer! The cosmos has been pushing you hard lately to get a firm hold on finances and relationships. Today is a good time to forget about the serious stuff and just play. Don’t worry, all of the serious stuff will still be there tomorrow.

"
657,7 february 2019,cancer,"
If you apply yourself to your work, the long term payoff could be significant. A terrific Sun-Jupiter aspect tells you to only focus on projects with  a big profit potential. Don’t waste time on the small stuff. If possible, farm that out to someone else.

"
658,8 february 2019,cancer,"
If you’re not focusing on Big Bucks, you’re making a big mistake. Shrewd Mercury is trying to locate some serious coin for you—are you on board? Gotta do your part. Ambitious Mars is on a roll in your house of success.

"
659,9 february 2019,cancer,"
It may be the weekend but something unusual could happen when it comes to your career or finances. Shrewd Mercury is on the job, which means that whatever happens could be beneficial. You may decide to completely change your career path and move on to more fertile territory.

"
660,10 february 2019,cancer,"
You may have felt stuck lately, Cancer. But logjams start to loosen up now that intelligent Mercury is in your house of optimism. Your ability to see things from a broader perspective will increase. Solutions are on the way.

Looking for love this Valentine’s Day? Both friends and online dating sites are favored for introductions. Coupled up crabs may actually feel like going out on the town as a group tonight and over the weekend, rather than being alone. It’s a smart time to talk about shared values too.

"
662,18 february 2019,cancer,"
The Sun in Pisces is making you more adventurous than usual, so get ready to break out of a rut. But from your chart it doesn’t appear that you’re going to run off and join the circus. Just be open to inspiration….plenty of it will be coming your way over the next few days.

"
665,11 march 2019,cancer,"
Certain people in your life need a reality check, Cancer. With the Moon and Mars in the wisest (and friendliest) part of your chart, you need to give them some advice. Whether they are open to it or not is another story. At least you tried.

"
666,12 march 2019,cancer,"
Reality check! Either you need one, or the people in your world do. Heck, maybe all of you need it. A Jupiter-Sun square indicates that opinions will be flowing like wine. The problem is, are they based on anything logical? If you are certain that your ideas are realistic and on target, then you need to pay very close attention to what other people are saying and doing. They could be way off the mark.

"
667,13 march 2019,cancer,"
People need to know what your game plan is, Cancer. This is no time to keep it a secret. This is at the job front as well as in your personal life. The good news is that people may be more supportive than you’d expect, and they could provide you with sage advice too.

"
668,14 march 2019,cancer,"
Top professionals, like medical doctors and airline pilots, are always taking classes to perfect their craft. (In some industries this is mandatory.) A close Sun-Mercury connection recommends that you do the same. But this doesn’t just have to be for work; it can be for fun too, like learning a foreign language or becoming a gourmet cook.

"
669,15 march 2019,cancer,"
There could be some rapidly changing circumstances over the next 48 hours, and you may have to react quickly. A battle between Mercury and Jupiter indicates that part of you will be in denial while another part will be  logical. Let logic win.

"
671,17 march 2019,cancer,"
With Mercury retrograde in your house of taking chances, you may be unsure about which path to go down. Fortunately Mercury makes a terrific aspect with Mars today in your house of friends and mentors. Seek out the opinion of someone who is in the know, which includes online experts who blog or podcast about their experiences.

"
672,18 march 2019,cancer,"
Obstacles mean nothing to you right now. Nor do critical words from people who don’t want to see you get ahead. With the Moon in Leo, you are focused and driven. Just wait until the sun enters Aries on Wednesday: you are then going to become a force of nature.

"
673,19 march 2019,cancer,"

"
676,22 march 2019,cancer,"

So what are you waiting for? Call a friend, chuck your to-do lists and responsibilities, and go off into the wild blue yonder.

"
680,31 march 2019,cancer,"Some of your best work will be done behind closed doors. Now that Mars is in your house of confidential matters, you should be working on things quietly. This could be anything from a job hunt to a diet to a new love relationship. With other planets in your house of adventure, you could be considering some exciting new options. Keep them to yourself for now.

"
681,7 april 2019,cancer,"The week ahead has some interesting energy when it comes to your relationships with others. It’s as if the cosmos is telling you to avoid traditional types—you know, the ones who think inside the box. Instead, you should surround yourself with visionaries who may  just be a little crazy…..but they’re the ones who know how to live!

"
682,8 april 2019,cancer,"There are a lot of people in your world who are expressing a lot of opinions lately. As a result, it could be easy to get confused. Some of these people have agendas that they’re hoping you will adopt. Stick to your guns. If something seems off, avoid it.

"
683,9 april 2019,cancer,"People could be touchy today. It seems that they are operating with a set of rules that they think everyone needs to obey. However, that’s their problem, not yours. You can choose to be diplomatic and play along or you could also opt to go your own way. I recommend the latter.

"
684,10 april 2019,cancer,"How good are you at getting things done? That’s going to be a big question over the next four months! Jupiter has just gone retrograde in your house of efficiency. If you are always underestimating how much time and effort something takes, you’re in for a wakeup call. But the upside is that you can be ultra-organized and realistic by mid-August.

"
685,11 april 2019,cancer,"Don’t be surprised if you have a craving to bust loose from confining situations. The two vibiest planets in the solar system, Venus and Neptune, are meeting up in your house of adventure. Neptune is all about inspiration, whereas Venus’s magnetism likes to pull juicy things your way. From your chart, it appears that you are more than ready for some major changes. Go for it.

"
686,12 april 2019,cancer,"It’s essential that you pay attention to deadlines and details these days, Cancer. Don’t underestimate how much time, money or effort something will take. If in doubt, be as conservative as possible. People may not like it, but you can’t afford to look foolish in the end.

"
687,13 april 2019,cancer,"Who’s the boss at home or in your other relationships, both personal and professional? People might be flexing their muscles today, trying to let you know that they are the alpha male or female. Avoid them and hang out with the types who aren’t into these head games.

"
688,14 april 2019,cancer,"If you want something, don’t beg. Don’t yell. And don’t settle for table scraps either! Some happening cosmic aspects help put you in the driver’s seat: assured, focused, competent and magnetic. This is a nice place to be!

"
689,15 april 2019,cancer,"Under current cosmic skies it will be easy to underestimate how long something will take to accomplish. Or how much it will cost and the amount of effort that will be required to make it happen. That’s OK. Logical Mercury enters your success house on Wednesday, at which time you’ll gain clearer insight.

"
690,16 april 2019,cancer,"Details and information could be murky today. It’s not that others are trying to deceive you; it’s more like that have no clue what’s going on. No problem, because intelligent Mercury enters your house of ambition tomorrow. You’ll figure it all out in no time.

"
692,18 april 2019,cancer,"A full moon is coming tomorrow in your domestic sector, which means that decisions need to be made about a family or housing matter. Your inner sense of well being is also governed by this house. If someone close is rattling your cage, you may need to set some boundaries or pull away.

"
693,19 april 2019,cancer,"Cancers are famous for being home bodies. Considering that tonight’s full moon occurs in your domestic sector, you should be happy. This is a good lunation, helping you to balance your work demands with those of your private life. Besides, you have a lot of planetary energy taking place in your house of friends, indicating that your BFFs will become a lot more important to you in the weeks ahead.

"
694,20 april 2019,cancer,"Are you well rested? I hope so, because the Sun is now in your house of hanging out with the tribe!

"
695,21 april 2019,cancer,"Your desire to live a healthier, cleaner lifestyle will increase due to a positive lunar aspect. It’s time to stop making excuses and to take control of problems that may have been going on for far too long. An exercise or diet buddy is a good plan right now, someone who will hold you accountable….and who’ll suffer along with you on those workouts!

"
696,22 april 2019,cancer,"Keep your phone powered up and check your emails: a surprise text or call from someone could bring about a fabulous experience.

697,23 april 2019,cancer,"A sudden surge of energy and inspiration could hit, prompting you to get more serious about your health and fitness. With lucky, healing Jupiter in a good angle, you could find just the right doctor, diet or protocol that will work wonders.

"
698,24 april 2019,cancer,"Fed up with being an enabler? Always being taken for granted in love? Then it’s time to reflect and take back some of your power, Cancer. Pluto starts to retrograde in your relationship sector, which will force you to get real. If it’s the other way around–you’re  the diva or difficult one–chances are you’re going to get a wakeup call.

"
699,25 april 2019,cancer,"Pluto just went retrograde in your partnership sector, and already you will be thinking about long term connections with people. One thing is certain: you need passion and plenty of it, in all areas of your life: love, work, travel, hobbies, you name it. Make sure you spend time with people who are just as passionate as you are.

"
700,26 april 2019,cancer,"Not everyone has your best interests at heart, something that may become obvious today. This could make you quite emotional, due to the Moon in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. Keep your cool, because this energy lasts a few days. With Mars in your house of inner work and pampering, why not pull away and take good care of yourself?

"
701,27 april 2019,cancer,"You don’t have all the facts about a certain situation or person, so don’t do anything just yet. Listening to the opinions of others will just make things worse—“too many chefs spoiling the sauce” so to speak. You need to rely on your own wisdom, but it will be off for a few days. Hold off.

"
702,28 april 2019,cancer,"You won’t be in the mood for anyone laying guilt trips or other crap on you today. Why should you be the dumping ground for other people’s nonsense? If need be, let them know that they can take their attitude somewhere else.

"
703,29 april 2019,cancer,"You are entering one of the most cathartic periods of your life when it comes to serious relationships. Last week Pluto, planet of personal power, went retrograde in this sector. Today Saturn does the same.

"
704,30 april 2019,cancer,"Screeeecchh!!  Throw on the brakes there, Cancer. A wicked Neptune-Mars-Moon aspect warns against diving into something too quickly. This could be anything: a dating situation, going to grad school, quitting the day job and starting a business, you name it. It’s not that you have to walk away from these things: just cool your jets a bit.

"
705,1 may 2019,cancer,"Your intuition is razor sharp thanks to Mars in the most hidden part of your chart. Use this to your advantage, as the red planet forms a terrific aspect with Mercury in your ambition sector.

"
706,2 may 2019,cancer,"Someone needs to be the grownup around here and it might as well be you. Yup, it looks like you’re going to be the voice of reason and serenity while everyone else whines and acts out. Fortunately this aspect doesn’t last long!

"
707,3 may 2019,cancer,"The right people, resources or routines may appear before you today. So if you’re smart, you’ll grab them! The good news is that interesting new people will continue to enter your life after this Saturday’s new moon in your house of networking.

"
708,4 may 2019,cancer,"A sparkling new Moon in Taurus can bring many exciting new people into your world, Cancer. Over the next six months you can have a lot of fun with the existing tribe and people you haven’t even met yet. Just be careful about getting too chummy with work colleagues. Associate with them, but don’t spill too much tea.

"
709,5 may 2019,cancer,"Stopping kidding yourself when it comes to health issues. The same goes for your fitness level. If you are overweight, out of shape and not glowing with health, it’s time to make a change. One of the smartest things that you can do right now is to find an exercise buddy and work out with them. Ask a friend to hold you accountable for brand-new habits that you’re going to develop.

"
710,6 may 2019,cancer,"You are in a fabulous place to meet new people, thanks to the recent new moon in your house of networking. And today lively, chatty Mercury glides into this sector. Over the next three weeks you could make some important new connections.

"
711,7 may 2019,cancer,"A partnership is just that: a place where opinions, feelings and responsibilities are shared. If you feel as though you are carrying too much weight, it’s time to let others know. This even includes your boss. There’s only so much that you should be expected to do.

"
712,8 may 2019,cancer,"Spontaneity is in the air, and it’s a perfect time for making last minute plans with friends. A terrific Mercury-Uranus aspect also recommends that you meet new people, so get out of the house and start mingling. With inspirational Neptune active in your multiculti house of new philosophy, some of the people you meet could be a real change form the usual.

"
713,9 may 2019,cancer,"Make sure that your own work is perfect, Cancer. A Venus-Jupiter trine demands accuracy and efficiency. Don’t sweat it if other people around you don’t have their sh** together. As long as your work shines, you will be able to impress the people who count.

"
716,12 may 2019,cancer,"Feeling glam or glum? If your appearance could use a bit of an update, then you have the cosmos’s permission to spend some money on yourself (yay!). Note that beauty-conscious Venus is in the house of fitness, so there will  be some effort needed on your part to complete the gorgeous package.

"
717,13 may 2019,cancer,"It’s a good time to get to the bottom of what’s really going on in a romance or group situation (which includes friends, volunteer organizations, work associates and so on). You need to know if you’re on the same page with these people. On Wednesday two planets move into houses that will help you align yourself with true soulmates, BFFs and colleagues.

"
718,14 may 2019,cancer,"Today is Mars’ last day in Gemini, your house of privacy and seclusion. Chances are you’ve been doing a lot of thinking about your birthday year ahead and what you’d like to manifest. Well get ready, Cancer, because tomorrow the red planet moves into your sign!

"
719,15 may 2019,cancer,"Woo-hoo! Two planets make a move today and they’re heading to places that spell P-A-R-T-Y. Venus glides into the friendship and networking sector, and look-at-me Mars enters Cancer. A social time lies ahead, but not only with the tribe. You can use this lively energy to schmooze potential bosses and clients. Join a club or a team. Whatever you do, don’t stay at home.

"
720,16 may 2019,cancer,"You need cooperation and an open feeling within your relationships, Cancer. This is just as true at the office as it is in your personal life. Let others know that they have a responsibility to be honest and direct. If they can’t do that, then what are you doing with them?

"
721,17 may 2019,cancer,"Roles may need to be reassigned. Duties might have to be changed. The bottom line is that doing things the same old way just ain’t gonna work anymore. The good news is that optimistic Jupiter will help you streamline things and whip people into shape.

"
722,18 may 2019,cancer,"There is quite an interesting vibe going on in your chart! First there’s a full moon in your house of romance. This could spell the end of your days of being alone, if you’re single. Dating? Then you could get a lot more serious with your lover. Spunky Uranus is all fired up in your house of friends, so a BFF could make introductions. Or a platonic friend might want to be more than that!

"
723,19 may 2019,cancer,"The Sun is getting ready to enter your house of closure, where we toss people, habits and circumstances that aren’t working for us any longer. The cosmos recommends taking a look at people you consider to be friends. Are some of them snarky or unreliable? If so, it’s time for a change. Bring in new BFFs who support you.

"
724,20 may 2019,cancer,"Keep your eye on the ball, Cancer. Murky Neptune is going to try to throw you off track. Just take things one hour at a time, one task at a time. Aggressive Mars is in your sign, pushing you to go faster than you should!

"
725,21 may 2019,cancer,"Move over, John Edward. People of the Cancer persuasion are going to be the most psychic people on the planet over the next four weeks. That’s because the Sun AND mental Mercury just glided into their house of the subconscious mind. Dreams and gut hunches will increase and they will be downright prophetic. It’s also a great time to do some inner work.

"
726,22 may 2019,cancer,"Keep a loose schedule over the next few days! Unpredictable Uranus is active in your house of friends and networking, indicating that plans could change at the drop of a hat. People could call with invitations to have lunch or cocktails. They could play matchmaker and introduce you to someone new. A former co-worker might tip you off about a job opening. But you don’t have to wait to hear from them; make that call!

"
727,23 may 2019,cancer,"Uh, you may want to curb your enthusiasm today, Cancer. With aggressive mars in your sign you run the risk of coming on too strong. Furthermore, certain people may try to burst your bubble. Don’t give them that opportunity. Stick to your ideas and values but be a little discreet.

"
728,24 may 2019,cancer,"You may be tempted to give a friend or colleague the benefit of the doubt, but is that wise? You need to be operating with facts, not appearances or opinions. Fortunately the cosmic skies clear up tomorrow. Until then hold people to your expectations.

"
729,25 may 2019,cancer,"Sometimes you need to invest some money in yourself, and now is one of those times! I’m not referring to a new wardrobe or a night out on the town, although there’s nothing wrong with that. A better way to go is to spend money on your health, such as a gym membership or organic food. Work with a therapist to put issues behind you. You’re worth the investment.

"
730,26 may 2019,cancer,"With the Sun in the most secluded, healing part of your chart you may be craving rest. And it’s wise to take it. Your jangled nerves and weary body need a break.

"
731,27 may 2019,cancer,"You are starting to realize that you are capable of so much more than you had previously thought. The North Node of the Moon is in Cancer,  and it governs who you are supposed to be in this lifetime. Inspirational Neptune forms a fabulous aspect with the Node, opening your eyes to fresh new possibilities concerning your life’s path.

"
732,28 may 2019,cancer,"A theme that is running through your chart this week is reality versus fantasy. Either the people around you are going to be floating around on a pink fluffy cloud, unable to see the world for what it is…..or it will be you! A Moon-Jupiter square indicates that people won’t be able to agree on a direction. They might slack off. Pay attention to this, because you may get stuck holding the ball.

"
733,29 may 2019,cancer,"A cosmic clusterf**k between Jupiter and Mercury could create a LOT of confusion today, Cancer. If anyone tells you that they have a gut feeling about something, and they swear that it’s 100% right, run the other way. Likewise, steer clear of people making big promises or who are planning world domination. Egos will be big and intuition will be off. Make sure that your head is on straight!

"
734,31 may 2019,cancer,"A dazzling Venus-Neptune aspect points the way to a much more flamboyant future for you. From your chart it appears that you’ve been playing it safe for far too long. One of the best things you can do is to find a role model, someone whose life you can emulate. Not that you want to be a cheap imitation of this person…but you can learn from them and develop your own exciting life story.

"
735,1 june 2019,cancer,"It takes team work to make the dream work, something you need to remind yourself about today. A Venus-Jupiter aspect recommends changing the way you handle things. It’s not that you’re difficult. It’s just that current situations in your life require more diplomacy.

"
736,2 june 2019,cancer,"Mercury will be entering your sign in a few days, and this will help you get a handle on what counts. Your thinking will become clearer and you’ll feel like expressing yourself as a result. Today is a good time to run things past people whose opinions you trust. Besides, joining forces with others is looking like a smart idea….start thinking about who should be on Team Cancer.

"
737,3 june 2019,cancer,"The new moon occurs in the most secretive, secluded part of your chart. The next few weeks are well aspected for pulling away from the crowd and recharging your batteries. Be choosy about whom you associate with. A happy Venus aspect recommends spending quality time with a lover and friends. However, tense Neptunian energy warns against sharing too much with colleagues or business connections.

"
738,4 june 2019,cancer,"Here’s an early birthday gift from the cosmos: Mercury enters Cancer today! Mars is there too, and these planets will act as a team to amp up your magnetism and further your interests. Just don’t get in everyone’s faces about what you want. Discretion and quiet behind-the-scenes action is the key.

"
739,6 june 2019,cancer,"The Moon is in Cancer and you are feeling friendlier than usual, even if you’re a social butterfly to begin with! Over the next few days you could meet some interesting new people (lovers included). Make plan with friends over the next 48 hours, and then get ready to power down a little bit. Once Venus changes signs on Saturday you’ll want some “alone time”.

"
740,7 june 2019,cancer,"Someone could surprise you with an offer of assistance. Don’t be afraid to reach out to a friend, mentor or colleague. Even if you just need someone’s opinion about a matter, ask for their input. They may be able to give you just the inspiration you need.

"
741,11 june 2019,cancer,"Rely on your own wisdom, especially at the office. If something seems off it probably is. Co-workers and clients could also be underestimating how long it’s going to take to do something, or how expensive it might be. Don’t confront people or try to explain the facts of life to them; eventually they’ll figure it out for themselves.

"
742,12 june 2019,cancer,"Take a step back from your life and make an assessment. Is this really the way you want to live? Are these the things you want to be doing? Do the people in your world fit? If not, be honest with yourself and head down another path.

"
743,13 june 2019,cancer,"It’s going to be hard to tell whether people are being straightforward or not. The best thing to do is to sit back and let them blather on. The less you say, the better. Eventually you’ll be able to figure them out.

"
744,14 june 2019,cancer,"Life is short, but you’re determined to squeeze as much out of it as you can. And why not? Neptune, planet of inspiration, is stirring up your desire to paint your life in bigger brushstrokes. If anyone is hemming you in though, you may lash out at them. Be careful not to make enemies of people whose help you may need.

"
745,15 june 2019,cancer,"Listen to the advice of others today, as they could shed some light on your situation. But in the end it all comes down to you. A Mercury-Moon aspect in Cancer will help you tap into your own wisdom. The Sun will soon be entering your sign, and you need to get clear about your next steps.

"
746,16 june 2019,cancer,"I feel sorry for anyone who tries to hem you in. With inspirational Neptune flying high in your house of adventure, you’re not going to listen to anyone  who tries to tell you that you can’t do something. Oh, and they’ll continue to do this as the week progresses….which means that you may need to put them in your place.

"
747,17 june 2019,cancer,"Clean up your act, Cancer. A full moon takes place in your house of productivity and getting things done. This is no time to have your head in the clouds, daydreaming. Keep it real. Besides, with the Sun entering your sign in a few days you shouldn’t be burdened with errands and work projects.

"
748,18 june 2019,cancer,"Sometimes other people need to have their eyes opened as to what’s going on. Or maybe they need someone to point out possibilities to them. You can be their guide in a positive way. With energetic Mars in your sign, your words have meaning.

"
749,19 june 2019,cancer,"Put up your dukes and fight? Aggressive Mars and mouthy Mercury are in your sign, and they won’t take kindly to anyone who tries to push you around. Things could get heated, especially with someone close. Wait until the Sun enters your sign before you deal with these people, if at all possible.

"
750,20 june 2019,cancer,"A friend or team member may do something unexpected, and it could create some turmoil. The Moon is in one of the most emotional parts of your chart and you might react without thinking things though. Your values may be different than someone else, which could be made apparent today. Keep calm and carry on as the Sun will soon be in your sign, brightening up your life!

"
751,21 june 2019,cancer,"Woo-hoo!!! The Sun enters Cancer, crowning your the favorite of the zodiac. But before you whip out ye olde bucket list and start planning your next adventure, know this: there will be a solar eclipse in your sign on July 3rd which could bring about fast-moving changes. And Neptune starts to retrograde today in your house of pushing past personal boundaries. This doesn’t mean that you’re stuck where you are; rather, you may be confused where to start. Take your time.

"
752,22 june 2019,cancer,"Life’s too short to play by the rules all the time. With the Moon in the most adventurous part of your chart, give yourself permission to loosen up a little and do things differently. A whopping solar eclipse will take place in Cancer on July 3rd, and you’ll have no choice but to live larger!

"
753,23 june 2019,cancer,"It may be difficult to get things out in the open today. Either you don’t feel like conversing or someone else is in that state. Whatever you do, don’t let your mind dream up wacky scenarios that may have no basis in reality. This goes for tomorrow too. Things will become more clear when Mercury changes signs on Wednesday.

"
754,24 june 2019,cancer,"A much more optimistic period is about to begin for you, but right now you may not be able to see that! It seems that worries are making you see the glass as being half full rather than half empty. You’re not stuck, something you’ll figure out tomorrow.

"
755,25 june 2019,cancer,"Some of your plans may need adjustment, and if you’re smart you’ll take care of that right away. The Sun is in your sign and you may be seeing nothing but green lights all around you. But you can only move in one direction at any given time.

"
756,27 june 2019,cancer,"Keep your schedule light over the next 48 hours, Cancer! Spontaneous Uranus is having some fun in your house of friends and networking. An offer to get together could come out of the blue. You could also meet new people who will play a part in your life for years to come.

"
757,28 june 2019,cancer,"Forging stronger bonds with people is the order of the day, thanks to a Moon-Saturn trine. But in order to do this you need to be a team player, open to the ideas and feelings off others. And they need to do the same. Next week’s solar eclipse in Cancer will open up a wonderful new chapter in relationships, but this may mean cutting off malcontents.

"
758,29 june 2019,cancer,"Need to increase your cash flow? Then it’s imperative to start mingling more with others. A Mercury-Moon aspect recommends getting the word out to a select few that you’re looking for a raise, new job, better clients, whatever. Attend industry events and try to hook up with a mentor too, even if it’s an online guru.

"
759,30 june 2019,cancer,"Don’t take on more than you can handle, Cancer. Right now it appears that you’re overly optimistic about what you can get done in 24 hours. An eclipse in your sign is arriving next week, and it will open new doors. So don’t get bogged down now in extraneous stuff that will tie you down.

"
760,1 july 2019,cancer,"Mars finally leaves your sign, which should help you settle down a bit. Ready to make more money? Good! The red planet is now in Leo, your house of making and saving more money. Notice the word “saving”. Don’t go crazy spending, as this is a side effect of hosting Mars in this part of your chart.

"
761,2 july 2019,cancer,"Your days of hiding in the shadows are over, Cancer. Glamorous, amorous Venus is getting ready to enter your sign, putting you front and center. This is a great time for pampering and a makeover, not to mention dazzling everyone with your presence!

"
762,3 july 2019,cancer,"Woo-hoo! A rollicking solar eclipse takes place in Cancer, which means that all of your fondest dreams are in the spotlight. Better yet is that Venus enters your sign today too, making you the most charismatic thing on two legs. But Saturn opposes this lunation, indicating that you won’t want to be hemmed in by anyone. If people aren’t giving you enough breathing room–or respect–then you may pack up your tent and head off into the sunset.

"
763,4 july 2019,cancer,"The recent solar eclipse in Cancer is setting you along a new path, one in which you’ll be more protective of your own needs and personal space. The Moon is still in your sign and it’s asking you to consider how “karmic” you think things are. Do you think, for example, that it’s your fate to settle for less? If that’s the case, you need to chuck that notion to the curb. Start expecting the best and it will come.

"
764,5 july 2019,cancer,"A productive Jupiter-Neptune aspect points the way to better habits and hacks. It may take awhile for these to become a daily part of your routine, but make an effort to incorporate them. Time and health are the most valuable assets we have. Protect your vitality and free up more happy hours.

"
765,6 july 2019,cancer,"This is a great weekend for getting out of town thanks to the Moon in your house of short distance travel. Don’t worry if you have to say closer to home; socializing and exploring your local neighborhood are also included. The more the merrier, so call your friends and make plans.

"
766,7 july 2019,cancer,"Your cash flow could slow down a bit now that Mercury is retrograde in your income sector. Job offers and raises might take awhile. Clients or prospects may be slow to respond. But the silver lining is that old deals from the past may return, and this time they’ll gel! That and the fact that this is over as of the 19th.

"
767,8 july 2019,cancer,"You should be sparkling with energy and charisma, thanks to lively Uranus forming a happy angle with magnetic Venus. This is not a day to worry about the problems of the world, your job or personal life. Just go out there and enjoy yourself.

"
768,9 july 2019,cancer,"No matter how badly you want to do things your way, it may not happen. A Saturn-Sun opposition pits your needs and plans against those of other people. You can fight this if you wish but you’re better off playing nice and cooperating, at least for the next 48 hours!

"
769,10 july 2019,cancer,"“The future’s so bright, I gotta wear shades!” That’s a line from a Timbuk 3 song (paging 1986, where are you?). But it perfectly describes what’s going on in your life at the moment. A fabulous Sun-Neptune trine kicks open doors that may have been shut and allows you to live in a bigger, bolder way.

"
770,11 july 2019,cancer,"People could be critical about the way you do things, but so what? Chances are they’re suffering from “group think” and they can’t see a bigger picture. This isn’t your problem, so let it go.

"
771,12 july 2019,cancer,"With luxury-loving Venus in your house of spending, you might be tempted to spend a little this weekend. And you should, provided that you can afford to! By the way, this doesn’t mean just designer clothes and swag. New golf clubs, a bike or hobby equipment counts too. It’s whatever makes you feel that you’re being good to yourself.

"
772,13 july 2019,cancer,"Your schedule should ease up a bit thanks to a Moon-Jupiter conjunction. And what if it hasn’t? Then take control of the situation and cut out some of your commitments and responsibilities, at least for the next few days. You need some down time.

"
773,14 july 2019,cancer,"You will be in no mood to take orders from anyone….but that doesn’t mean that they’re not going to try! By the way, this is a theme that has been running through your chart since the Cancer eclipse on July 3rd. If anyone gets too out of line your may give them their walking papers at the next  eclipse, which is on Tuesday.

"
774,15 july 2019,cancer,"Tension is mounting as the lunar eclipse in Capricorn arrives on Tuesday. This is a theme that has been going on in your chart all month, since the time of the Cancer eclipse on the 3rd: just how much of your personal power do you want to give away to others, especially a romantic partner? Today is a smart time to think about this as the Moon swings past Pluto and Saturn, planets that deal with maturity and strength.

"
775,16 july 2019,cancer,"How do you spell “cooperation”? I can tell you this—it’s not spelled me-me-me. That’s the message behind today’s lunar eclipse in your house of serious relationships. Many crabs will get engaged, meet The One or witness some kind of forward movement over the next few weeks. But if anyone is being pigheaded, it may be time to move on.

"
776,17 july 2019,cancer,"It may seem as though other people are holding all of the cards right now, and it’s possible that they do. So….you can choose to fight back, or be a wuss and let them walk all over you. Or, you can wait until tomorrow when cosmic aspects are working in your favor again. Can you wait 24 hours? Yeah, I thought so.

"
777,18 july 2019,cancer,"What a wonderful day to try something new! If you’re in a rut, you can bust out of it, thanks to an uplifting Venus-Neptune trine. This aspect bodes well for romance too. Be as flirty and sexy as you like. Trust me, you will be noticed.

"
778,19 july 2019,cancer,"This month has been a reflective time, intensely so. Two eclipses have forced you to examine your needs and biggest goals. Your relationships with others have gone under a microscope too. Now Mercury starts retrograding through Cancer, telling you to focus even more on what you need and want in your life. This energy lasts until the 31st, so make the most of it.

"
779,20 july 2019,cancer,"The Sun will soon be leaving your sign, which really is nothing to be upset about. Once El Sol enters Leo, things in your life may actually start to quite down and become more stable. Today is a smart time to consider the ways in which you give your personal power away to other people and situations that don’t deserve it! Do this before moving on.

"
780,21 july 2019,cancer,"This is the Sun’s last day in your sign, but it’s nothing to get upset about. On the contrary–El Sol forms a terrific aspect with Mercury in Cancer. It’s perfect for thinking about what you’d like to manifest in the next eleven months. Self image need an update? Then get to work on it, because once the Sun enters Leo, you’ll be on display and in demand.

"
781,22 july 2019,cancer,"The Sun is now in Leo, your money sector, and the action starts right away. Make sure your resume is up to date if you’re looking for a new gig. Start getting caught up on projects because you could land a promotion, new client or an additional source of revenue. The entire week ahead has good aspects that could increase your bottom line.

"
782,23 july 2019,cancer,"There is a lot of positive energy going on in your income sector right now, so make sure that you take advantage of it. Assertive Mars is in this sector and today it forms a harmonious trine with the Moon, indicating that career matters could go your way. Don’t be afraid to show a potential employer or client how passionate and talented you truly are.

"
783,24 july 2019,cancer,"The Sun may have left your sign, but Mercury and Venus haven’t! And today they line up in a perfect aspect called a conjunction, which fuses the energy of both planets. This is a wonderful time to revamp your self image, which isn’t just clothes and hair and makeup. It’s also about your attitude, what you think and what you say.

"
784,25 july 2019,cancer,"“Get outta my way!” That’s your mantra today as motivator Mars is hell bent on getting things done. This especially applies to getting organized and catching up on projects at home and at the office. Lucky, abundant Jupiter is pushing you as well, reminding you of how good it will feel to be on top of things.

"
785,26 july 2019,cancer,"Your life needs more structure, which is the message from the stars today. Strategic Mercury glides into your second house of ritual and creating strong foundations. This includes love, money, health and anything else that will give you greater peace if you have them under control.

"
786,27 july 2019,cancer,"Cha-ching!! Yes, the lovely sound of cold, hard cash. The lovely smell and feel of Benjamins crisply stacked in your wallet (for my friends outside the US, a “Benjamin” is a $100 bill). Cancers are in one hell of a good place for scoring more dinero as profits planet Venus enters your money sector. It joins the Sun and Mars, creating a powerful trifecta. The next four weeks are awesome for finding new sources of income and building revenues.

"
787,28 july 2019,cancer,"Yesssss. You’re finally going to get your just rewards! The hard work you’ve been putting in is going to pay off, although you may have a hard time believing it. Part of the problem is that Mercury has been retrograde in your sign. That changes on Wednesday, so get ready for forward momentum.

"
788,29 july 2019,cancer,"Remember when Mom used to say—after you had done something stupid, or were considering a doofus move—“are you going to jump off a bridge because your friends want to?” Well Cancer, it’s that kind of a day. That cosmic Mom in the heavens is warning you to not follow the crowd. So if a friend, colleague or team member is trying to get you to go along with something, don’t. 

"
789,30 july 2019,cancer,"You may be anxious to move forward with something, but the cosmos recommends slowing down a bit. Think through your options and strategy. What’s wonderful is that better ideas and opportunities are about to come your way, so you should remain open and let them come in.

"
790,31 july 2019,cancer,"Oh happy day. Mercury goes direct in Cancer, ending several weeks of doubting yourself. There is a new moon tomorrow in Leo, which is your house of stability and routine. The next two weeks are well aspected for getting into a predictable groove–good habits, balanced emotions.

"
791,1 august 2019,cancer,"The Leo new moon opens up a fresh chapter in which stability can return to your life, in many forms: romantically, financially and emotionally. It’s a smart time to establish new routines and slow down a bit. This might mean pulling away from people, though, especially friends and work colleagues. Anyone who’s taking up too much of your time, or who brings extra (unneeded) drama, should be sidelined for awhile.

"
792,2 august 2019,cancer,"People may not be willing to stick to their roles or responsibilities today. Nor will they be interested in hearing advice from you. Your best bet is to walk away from this, because the mood changes in your favor next week. One message from the cosmos is clear though: you don’t have to put up with this nonsense. It’s time to step into a stronger position of power. Give it a few days.

"
793,3 august 2019,cancer,"Get your mind off your responsibilities and just have a good time this weekend. The Moon is in the most sociable part of your chart, telling you to cut loose. If you can get out of town for the day, go for it! Short distance travel is favored. But exploring your local neighborhood is on the cosmos’s agenda too. Try something new.

"
794,4 august 2019,cancer,"Anyone who thinks that Cancers are scared sensitive types are in for one heck of a surprise! With the two most assertive planets in the solar system–Mars and Pluto–forming an alliance, you are stepping into a place of power and self confidence. By the way, it looks good on you.

"
795,5 august 2019,cancer,"When the Moon is in Libra, you tend to be more focused on inner comfort and routines than usual. But the Moon winks at saucy Neptune in the most free-spirited part of your chart, telling you to cut loose a little. Don’t forget, a month ago there was an eclipse in your sign, helping you do a 180. Often eclipses take four weeks to deliver their message. Are you ready?

"
796,6 august 2019,cancer,"No matter how much you want to get ahead, you’ll need the assistance of other people. The smartest thing that you can do right now is to cut the fluff and get right down to the facts. Playing the role of the dreamy creative type, or the bold visionary, isn’t going to work. Be as straightforward as possible, not only today but for the rest of the week.

"
797,7 august 2019,cancer,"Today and tomorrow are two of the best days in 2019 to put more cash in your pocket. In astrology, it’s when you initiate things that counts. So if you’re smart you’ll work with this energy. Send out your resume. Make a big ask. Schedule presentations. Research a business you’d like to start. But above all, be willing to cooperate, because teamwork counts for a lot right now.

"
798,8 august 2019,cancer,"It’s time to remove any rose-colored glasses you may have been wearing when it comes to love, Cancer. Take lovers down from their pedestals. Stop settling. An ultra-pragmatic vibe is in the air, and you need to be involved with someone who treats you well. Sharing, teamwork, being on the same page: that’s what matters most right now.

"
799,9 august 2019,cancer,"Are you playing around, or playing for keeps? With mature Saturn in the house of commitment, it’s time to ask yourself just how devoted you are to certain people and plans. There’s nothing wrong with admitting that a certain connection isn’t right for you, by the way. When Uranus goes retrograde next week all of your closest relationships will go under a microscope.

"
800,10 august 2019,cancer,"So many options…..but which one to choose? Inspirational Neptune is active in your house of thinking big and bold, which is great! But the logical Sun is over on the side saying, “Uh, okay—but you can only pick one or two of your bright ideas.” So do what El Sol says and narrow things down. Tomorrow some terrific aspects arrive that will help you chase after your dreams.

"
801,11 august 2019,cancer,"Career and money matters pick up steam, thanks to two glorious aspects happening today! Jupiter has been retrograde in your work sector, possibly bogging you down with too many details and paperwork. But the gas giant resumes direct motion, just as shrewd Mercury enters your income zone. Just be wary of team members—Uranus starts to backstroke in your house of group activities, which includes friends FYI. Be careful about the company you keep.

"
802,12 august 2019,cancer,"The cosmos is pushing you to create more balance in your life, Cancer, whatever that means to you. A sturdy Saturn-Moon aspect today is all about your closest relationships. It’s clear that drama has to go, to be replaced by mutual respect and caring. The full moon on Thursday represents an end point, a time when you can move away from chaotic situations that don’t serve you.

"
803,13 august 2019,cancer,"You may feel as though you “deserve” an expensive treat, and that may be true! But hold on to your wallet. A Moon-Mercury opposition warns against emotional spending. Thursday’s full moon occurs in your house of net worth. You need to build it up, so think about the long term rather than today’s impulses.

"
804,14 august 2019,cancer,"A Sun-Venus conjunction puts you in the mood for making love…or finding the right kind of amour! Making money….but doing what you truly enjoy! Yup, it’s a winner of a day, so take this energy and use it wisely. Tomorrow’s full moon allows you to change things up in romance and finance.

"
805,15 august 2019,cancer,"The Aquarius full moon sets your sights on intimacy, steamy sex and deep emotional bonding. Do you have that in your relationship? If not then it’s time to do something about it. And if you’re single and want to have a soulmate in your life, then this lunation could represent the end of being alone. Once Mars moves into Virgo on Sunday you could meet someone locally, so get ready to sizzle.

"
806,16 august 2019,cancer,"People could be as erratic as hell today, acting in ways that you wouldn’t have expected. Fortunately shrewd, logical and brainy Mercury is in one of the most chilled out parts of your chart. Keep calm and carry on. This may mean ignoring people who don’t want to do their share, but so it is. This energy doesn’t last long.

"
807,17 august 2019,cancer,"Play by the rules or do your own thing? Should you be the dutiful employee/lover/spouse/parent/friend, or should you just worry about yourself for now? If you need some “me” time, take it. Next week will be a busy one in which you’ll be around a lot of people. Recharge your batteries and don’t think that it’s selfish!

"
808,18 august 2019,cancer,"Anyone who thinks that you’re shy and sensitive, always ready to pull into your shell, is in for a big surprise. That’s because you’re entering one of the most vocal and social periods you’ve experienced in a long time. High octane Mars is now in your house of thinking, speaking and expressing yourself. Venus and the Sun will arrive later this week. Forget about being a crab–it’s all about being a social butterfly for the next month!

"
809,19 august 2019,cancer,"You know what you want and you’re determined to get it. Is that such a problem? Nope! It may be for the people around you, but deep inside you know that you’re going to hold on until things start going your way. Kudos!

"
810,20 august 2019,cancer,"When it comes to money rely on facts and logic, not emotions. All that glitters is not gold, so don’t go chasing after a shiny, sparkling new thing. This goes for job offers, business deals and side hustles. Besides, something better could appear once the Sun enters Virgo on Friday.

"
811,21 august 2019,cancer,"Look out for your own interests and don’t be shy about expressing your opinions either. With so much planetary activity taking place in your house of thinking and speaking, you’re the person that others should be listening to. Today magnetic Venus glides into your house of self expression, which will help being others around to your point of view.

"
812,22 august 2019,cancer,"“I double dare you!”  People may seem intent on pushing your buttons, maybe making you feel as though you’re a wimp for not being willing to do certain things. Or maybe you’re holding back without any pressure from others. That’s OK; it’s wise to be careful. Right now you need reassurances and routine more than you need taking unnecessary risks.

"
813,23 august 2019,cancer,"A lively social period opens up for you as the Sun glides into Virgo. This is your third house of schmoozing, networking and sharing your thoughts with others. It’s also the sector that governs short distance travel and being busy in your neighborhood. This Virgo season will be more intense than most because high octane Mars happens to be here. Rest up; you’re going to be burning the candle at both ends.

"
814,24 august 2019,cancer,"Your words have power thanks to a fabulous meeting of Mars and Venus in your communication zone. Use this energy to tell someone how much you care. Or to impress a head honcho. Maybe you need to get your message out in the social or news media. Whatever you need to do, or whomever you need to connect with, don’t be shy.

"
815,25 august 2019,cancer,"From your chart it appears that you’re getting tired of holding things in, Cancer. So it others are constantly spouting theri opinions, or trying to get you to do things their way, speak up. On the flip side, make sure that you’re not aggressively peddling your game plan to someone. This week the energy is all about teamwork.

"
816,26 august 2019,cancer,"OK, single Cancers–get ready for an interesting week. Both online dating sited AND friends can help you meet someone new. If you’re already in a romantic relationship. a terrific Uranus-Venus aspect today encourages you to go out with the tribe and stop living in a couple bubble.

"
817,27 august 2019,cancer,"Someone may try to use guilt you to get you to do something today, or maybe even criticism or force! But with the Moon in Cancer you will be looking out for #1. No problem there. Just don’t start feeling defensive or sorry for yourself, OK? Besides, the rest of the week has a lot of lively, fun energy happening with friends, so make plans with them and forget about everyone else.

"

With unpredictable Uranus active in the most social part of your chart, you could meet a new lover/friend/mentor in an unusual way.

"
819,29 august 2019,cancer,"This is without a doubt the best time in 2019 to let people know what’s on your mind and in your heart. The Sun, Mars and Venus are all in your communicating sector and chatty Mercury joins them today. The great thing is that people want to hear from you. Step out of the shadows and into the sunlight.

"
820,30 august 2019,cancer,"You are entering one of the most thoughtful, focused periods you’ve experienced in a long time, Cancer. Planets are piled up in your third house of thinking, speaking and expressing yourself. Today a new moon occurs here, making it even more important to get your message out to people who need to hear it. But be prepared for resistance, as not everyone will accept your ideas and opinions. Most likely they’re jealous and throwing things at you just to get you off your game.

"
821,31 august 2019,cancer,"It’s not what people say, it’s how they say it that counts! And it could be difficult to read between the lines right now, but you have to make that effort. With so much planetary energy in your house of thinking and communicating, you  seem to be right on point. But you’re going to need the input and cooperation of others. Cut through their confusion and figure it out.

"
822,1 september 2019,cancer,"Hanging out with friends and romancing your lover are under wonderful aspects right now, so enjoy!

The long term prospects are excellent as mature Saturn is on the job.

"
823,2 september 2019,cancer,"Talk much? You could be WAY more verbal than usual, due to a Mars-Sun meet-up in the chattiest part of your chart! This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. People need to know what’s on your mind. The only thing you have to watch out for is  making promises that you can’t deliver on.

"
824,3 september 2019,cancer,"Patience is a virtue, and you’re definitely going to need it today. Clients, co-workers or loved ones appear to be in an unproductive fog in which they can’t figure out how to put one foot in front of the other. Don’t be afraid to tell them to snap out of it (but be diplomatic with clients!). If you let this slide it will become a bigger problem later.

"
825,4 september 2019,cancer,"Which end is up? People will be spouting opinions and trying to get things done, but there seems to be mass confusion. Blame it on a Venus-Jupiter opposition, which will make it tough for people to focus on the end game and the details. Wait until tomorrow when at least YOU will know what to do and how to do it.

"
826,5 september 2019,cancer,"You will have no trouble speaking your mind today thanks to verbal Mercury being active in your communication sector. So go ahead, speak your mind but remain diplomatic. Not everyone around you is seeing things clearly and it could take another week or so before they realize that you’re right.

"
827,6 september 2019,cancer,"Don’t be shy about pushing your own interests, Cancer. This means speaking up and sharing your ideas. A little self promotion wouldn’t hurt either. If the people in your world are too self-centered, the maybe it’s time for a brand new crew.

First, abundant Jupiter is in your house of romance and creativity for the first time in over a decade. It’s also telling you to have more fun and to do some much-needed pampering. And yesterday Mars entered your house of living big and bold. Leo, this could be one of the most expansive years you’ve had in your life. Enjoy!

"
830,2 january 2019,leo,"Don’t worry about it if you spent New Year’s Day drinking more champagne and eating leftover Christmas cookies. The diet can start, and should start, today. A superb meeting of the authoritative Sun and disciplined Saturn occurs in your house of wellness. Of all the signs of the zodiac, Leos are the most likely to stick to a fitness and diet regimen.

"
831,3 january 2019,leo,"People could be acting out today, and chances are you aren’t going to be in the mood to deal with it. That’s because logical, level-headed headed Mercury is in your house of emotions. It’s not your destiny to deal with whiners and complainers, FYI. If you’re surrounded by too many of them, it may be time to find some more optimistic folks to hang out with.

"
832,5 january 2019,leo,"You weren’t put on this planet to suffer, my friend. Get that idea out of your head now! A nurturing Venus aspect allows you to lick your wounds and move on. Get ready, because life is about to become a heck of a lot busier—and more fun! You won’t have the time to fret.

In an interesting twist, a solar eclipse occurs also in your house of planning and efficiency. If there was ever a time to brainstorm and develop solid plans about audacious dreams, this is it.

This also happens to be the house of creativity, so you should be able to dip into that well of genius inside of you.

"
835,8 january 2019,leo,"People may not agree on the direction or the vision of a particular project or idea. Maybe they’re mired in the small foofoo stuff that doesn’t mean anything. Or perhaps they’re trying to rush things along too quickly. Try to find a middle ground—-if they will let you!

930,17 may 2019,leo,"Let’s face it, we can get into ruts when it comes to having fun! If you’re stuck in the pizza and Netflix groove, for instance, why not bust out of it? Maybe you should try rock climbing or going to the science museum. Optimistic Jupiter is in a creative mood, ready to try anything. So should you.

"
931,18 may 2019,leo,"Some exciting energy is percolating below the surface, and it’s coming to a head. The full moon in Scorpio tonight will help wrap things up. Even though this lunation occurs in your domestic sector, your career and other big goals are highlighted. Eccentric Uranus could throw a happy surprise your way, and the end result will be contentment and a greater sense of security.

"
932,19 may 2019,leo,"From your chart it appears that you need to take much better care of your body, Leo. You need more sleep, a more disciplined exercise routine and less stress in your life. You’re about to enter a more social period very soon, one in which you’ll be meeting a lot of people. Recharge your batteries now.

"
933,20 may 2019,leo,"Your imagination may be getting the better of you, courtesy of a wonky North Node aspect. Stick with facts and figures and avoid speculation. If you need someone’s opinion, wait until the Sun enters your house of friends and mentors on Tuesday.

"
934,21 may 2019,leo,"They say that people make the world go round, which is news to Copernicus and Galileo but not to you! Today the fiery Sun and lively Mercury enter your eleventh house of friends and networking. Friends, acquaintances, club members and colleagues will be your key to success and enjoying life over the next month. Don’t be too proud to ask for help or advice if you need it, Leo. Mentors are all around you.

"
935,22 may 2019,leo,"Some interesting career news could come your way, and it has a hush-hush vibe to it. Maybe it’s the opportunity to interview for a job. Perhaps it’s industry intel that’s valuable. Or maybe you come up with an idea for an entrepreneurial venture. With energetic Mars active in the house of research and secrecy, dive right in.

"
936,23 may 2019,leo,"Don’t rush in where angels fear to tread, Leo! Use your Spidey sense to determine if a particular plan, idea or person is worth it, but don’t take action just yet. Besides, old fears from the past could crop up which will make you question yourself. It’s a mixed up day of aggression and fear, which means that it’s NOT a good time to make any decisions.

"
937,24 may 2019,leo,"Give someone an inch, and they’ll take a mile? It could happen today, Leo. Unless you want to get dumped on, set up some boundaries. If not, people will be all too willing to let you do all the heavy lifting. Let them do their own fair share for once.

"
938,25 may 2019,leo,"Jupiter is in the most creative, romantic part of your chart—-and it’s practically screaming at you to have more fun! It winks at the Moon in your house of serious love, so if you have a partner, then make this a special weekend. If you don’t, you could meet someone who’s a keeper.

"
939,26 may 2019,leo,"It’s critical to be around people who share your values, Leo. A Sun-Chiron aspect encourages you to spend more time with people who are forward thinking. A wise man once said, in a nautical metaphor, that people are either anchors or motors. They can pull you down or propel you forward. Make the right choice.

"
940,27 may 2019,leo,"Everyone thinks that Leos are slinky, feline and sexy. What they fail to realize is that you can suffer from self-image problems just as much as anyone else. That may have been happening lately, due to some dicey cosmic energy. But an inspirational Neptune aspect helps put you back on course: fierce, independent and full of life. Oh, and sexy too!

"
941,28 may 2019,leo,"It may be hard to see the good in people today, Leo. With the Moon in Pisces, you may be more emotional than usual. On the other hand, you may be dead-on accurate: these people could be downright scum! But is it worth getting all worked up about it? Don’t you have better things to worry about?

"
942,29 may 2019,leo,"Just because someone is a trusted friend or colleague doesn’t mean that they need to know every bloody thing about your life, Leo. Nor do you need to know everything about them. Balance is needed right now within your relationships. You have enough of your own drama to deal with; you don’t need to indulge in anyone else’s.

"
943,30 may 2019,leo,"Leos love the luxe life, there’s no doubt about that. But according to your chart you need to rein in your spending. A good way to go is to adopt the principle of minimalism: buy and own very little, but make sure it’s top quality and chic. That way you still keep that regal mojo going without being broke.

"
944,31 may 2019,leo,"Things that seemed impossible not too long ago are somehow looking a lot more real, Leo! A lovely Venus-Neptune trine is inspiring you to take another look at what you think you’re capable of. Two upcoming eclipses in July will shake you out of the past and into a new future. Start getting ready now.

"
945,1 june 2019,leo,"Self assurance is an attractive quality, and it’s time for you to develop more of it. Recent events may have made you feel like more of an alley cat than a fierce feline. But with charismatic Venus in your house of authority, you’re starting to get your old mojo back. Hallelujah.

"
946,2 june 2019,leo,"You’re on the verge of making a major decision about your life’s path, Leo. This could be in any area. The good news is that transformative Pluto and mature Saturn are doubling down in the most practical part of your chart, so the choices you make will be good ones. You deserve to live a more beautiful life, something that you’re starting to realize.

"
947,3 june 2019,leo,"You’re entering into quite an independent period, one in which you’ll be carefully selecting who you associate with. The new moon occurs in your house of friends and networking. Usually this kind of lunation makes you want to hang out with everyone and just enjoy life. But this year a Saturn-Venus trine indicates that you will only be letting practical, drama-free people into your circle. Jealous frenemies and divas need not apply.

"
948,4 june 2019,leo,"Sshhh!! Shrewd Mercury is now in your twelfth house of intuition and secrecy. Zip your lips and say as little as possible, even to people you trust. Red hot Mars also happens to be in this sector, and that blabbermouth has a hard time keeping its mouth shut. But it’s imperative to do so. Instead, do as much behind the scenes research as possible. The next three weeks are also awesome for doing inner work.

"
949,5 june 2019,leo,"Your mind could be way  too overactive today, courtesy of high octane Mars lining up with the passionate Moon. Your subconscious mind could stir up all sorts of wacky stuff, some of which may be based on reality and some not. Wait til Friday to act on any psychic hits you receive or decisions you need to make.

"
950,6 june 2019,leo,"Your sign is quite familiar with the idea of wielding power quietly. The other signs may think that you’re flamboyant and always showing off how fierce you are. But they forget that a cat like you likes to stalk its prey, remaining hidden in the shadows until the time is right….and then you pounce. It’s that kind of a day, Leo! Stay low to the ground, say little and just observe.

"
951,7 june 2019,leo,"Your confidence gets a boost as sparkling Uranus sends some mojo your way. This is a smart time to use both sides of your brain: the logical left side and the conceptual right. They’re both working together (instead of fighting) so you’ll be able to feel good about yourself and life in general.

"
952,11 june 2019,leo,"They say that flattery will get you everywhere, but is that really true? Uh, from your chart the answer is no, at least for the next 48 hours. So be wary if people are kissing up too much. And don’t go down that brown nosing path yourself.

"
953,12 june 2019,leo,"Tap into your intuition today, that mystical source of wisdom. From your chart it appears that you need some down time. There are plenty of people around you who can and will proc=vide sage advice, but right now it needs to come from within.

"
954,13 june 2019,leo,"Make sure that you pitch in and help, even if you don’t feel like it! A Sun-Pluto aspect promises that if you do, it will come back to you. People need to know that you’re willing to be a team player. This is a recurring theme in your chart over the next few months, so get used to it.

"
955,14 june 2019,leo,"Things are looking up for you but you can’t really see it. You’re so bogged down in your day to day reality that some of the passion for living has left you. Don’t worry–good times lie ahead. When the full moon arrives on Monday you’ll start to feel lighter.

"
956,15 june 2019,leo,"You are on the verge of physical and mental burnout, and you simply can’t keep pushing yourself like this. All the more reason to kick back and relax this weekend. But taking a day off here and there won’t be enough: you need some serious R&R, something that the July 3rd eclipse will help you do.

"
957,16 june 2019,leo,"Leave your cares behind, Leo. You are a fixed sign. As a result you can dig into a problem like a lion tearing a zebra apart for dinner. And then you can chew on the damn bones for a few days. Let things go. Otherwise your health will be negatively impacted. Namaste!

"
958,17 june 2019,leo,"It’s time to stop diddling around and wrap up a creative project if some kind. And while you’re at it, you need to figure out what’s going on in your love life. A full moon occurs in your house of romance and talent, but foggy Neptune is making things way too nebulous. When the Sun enters cancer this Friday your intuition will provide you with the insight you need.

"
959,18 june 2019,leo,"Your Spidey sense is right on target today, but you’re in a practical mood as well. So take those psychic hits and run with them. Tomorrow the mood changes quite a bit, so seize the moment.

"
960,19 june 2019,leo,"It could be harder than hell to keep your mouth shut as people will be playing head games and trying to push others around. It’s a “take a deep breath and count to ten” kind of a day, Leo. Your intuition could be off too, so don’t even think of relying on it. But once the Sun rolls into cancer on Friday, your psychic skills will increase, and you’ll be able to put trolls in their place.

"
961,20 june 2019,leo,"Someone might have on their bossy pants, and it could come as a surprise. Hey, it could be you who decides to fight back against something or someone that’s annoying you! However, you might want to hold off until next Wednesday, when loquacious Mercury enters Leo. 

"
962,21 june 2019,leo,"Leo, you are entering one of the most cleansing, transformative periods of your life. The Sun enters Cancer, the most psychological part of your chart. Neptune starts to retrograde in Pisces, yet another sector that governs your mental well being. Over the next four weeks your thoughts, feelings and habits will go under a cosmic microscope. Get ready to do some serious inner work.

"
963,22 june 2019,leo,"Yum. The weekend is looking steamy and passionate thanks to the Moon in Pisces. Sure, you could spend the weekend in the boudoir. But this is also your house of the occult! Maybe it’s time for a psychic reading or a session with a shaman.

"
964,23 june 2019,leo,"Loved ones could be flaky as hell, not being able to make up their minds about the simplest things. There could also be some petty disagreements and jealousy going on. Don’t sweat it; this is a temporary cosmic storm which will be over within 48 hours. When Mercury enters Leo on Wednesday you’ll be able to talk to these people and get to the bottom of things.

"
965,24 june 2019,leo,"Your emotions could be going all over the place, and as a result it could be hard to make decisions. There could be a lot of good options out there, and you may not be able to see them due to your brain fog. Clear that up and you’ll be in a much better spot.

"
966,25 june 2019,leo,"A Moon-Chiron aspect may be shaking up your confidence, but this won’t last long. Recent events have made you wait sensitive and wary. Once strategic, logical Mercury enters your sign tomorrow, you’ll feel that old mojo coming back!

"
967,27 june 2019,leo,"Some surprising career news could come your way, and this is a good thing. Your track record speaks for itself and people have taken notice. This energy carries into the weekend so be ready to show off your talent.

"
968,28 june 2019,leo,"Maintain some balance between all of your responsibilities and activities, Leo. An eclipse is coming next week that will test the limits of your physical and emotional health. If you’re overdoing things, the cosmos os going to deliver a wakeup call.

"
969,29 june 2019,leo,"You may be used to impressing others with your fierce attitude and refusal to settle for less. After all, you are the king or queen of the jungle! But today you’ll be able to dazzle others with your logic and ideas. Don’t be afraid to show the world this side of your persona.

"
970,30 june 2019,leo,"A friend or lover may be heading down a path that’s not right for them. Speak to them about this, even if they don’t seem to welcome your opinion. Eventually they will realize that you were right, and that you had their back.

"
971,1 july 2019,leo,"Yeah, baby! Leo season is three weeks away but the cosmos is starting the party early. Mars rolls into your sign today, getting you charged up and focused on your deepest desires. Intelligent Mercury is already there, so start creating that bucket list for the year ahead.

"
972,2 july 2019,leo,"Feeling like a sexy secret agent? Or maybe you feel the energy of a mystical Taoist warrior-monk. Perhaps you’re ready to pull away from people and quietly plan your next coup. Blame it all on Venus, which is entering the most secretive part of your chart. Sshhh!!

"
973,3 july 2019,leo,"Some seriously big things are happening behind closed doors, Leo. I’m referring to the inner sanctum of your mind, which is bolted shut so that the outside world can’t get in. A powerful solar eclipse in Cancer is telling you to stop, slow down and reconsider all the aspects of your life. If anything or anyone is making you unhappy, then get out the pruning shears and start cutting. It may be painful, but so is living a life that isn’t authentic.

"
974,4 july 2019,leo,"Releasing the past and any negativity that currently exists in your life is not an easy task. That’s what yesterday’s solar eclipse was all about, and today you might be feeling out of sorts. It’s not your karma to deal with crappy emotions, people and situations, Leo. The sooner you realize that the faster you’ll be able to move on and feel better.

"
975,5 july 2019,leo,"Yaasss! The Moon is in Leo and it’s time to have some fun. Optimistic Jupiter is smiling from your house of creativity, telling you to try something different when it comes to relaxing and enjoying life. Sometimes we get into ruts when it comes to our “playtime”. Get out of the old sandbox and into a new one.

"
976,6 july 2019,leo,"Mercury is going to go retrograde tomorrow in your sign, which means that you’ll have a lot of thinking to do over the next two weeks. Today is a smart time to consider your habits and routines as the Moon is in organized Virgo.   You’re going to need a strong foundation in the months ahead. Might as well start now.

"
977,7 july 2019,leo,"Your birthday season is not far off, and Mars and Mercury are already in Leo. This is great for motivation and thinking things through. It just so happens that Mercury begins to retrograde today, a situation that will last through the 19th. Use this energy to rethink your plans. Have your values changed? You’re going through an amazingly metamorphic chapter, and your idea of what’s important could be altered dramatically.

"
978,8 july 2019,leo,"There are changes afoot with your career, and you may be torn between two (or more) paths. One of the best things that you can do is to use your intuition for guidance. This will mean quieting your mind through meditation or a long walk in nature. A good psychic could also provide you with guidance.

"
979,9 july 2019,leo,"You could find yourself in a situation in which things simply aren’t adding up. Don’t drive yourself crazy trying to figure it all out, because that won’t happen today. But by Thursday things should become crystal clear.

"
980,10 july 2019,leo,"You could be highly inspired to take better care of your inner world, Leo. Your sign is famous for being image-conscious but there’s more to life than that. Do whatever it takes to heal your psyche and become more balanced.

"
981,11 july 2019,leo,"You’re tired of feeling like other people are in control of your life and you may rebel. This is your choice, of course. But with so much planetary energy going on in your confidential twelfth house, you could also pull away and plot your escape!

"
982,12 july 2019,leo,"Oohhh, what a luscious weekend you have ahead! Glam Venus is in Leo and it winks at the passionate Moon. This is a great time for shopping and pampering yourself. It’s also well suited for socializing, flirting and going out on the town. Enjoy.

"
983,13 july 2019,leo,"A lucky meeting of the Moon and Jupiter could bring a happy event in romance. Creative projects also soar, to the point where you might think that things are happening too easily. Listen, not everything in life has to take forever or be full of angst. Some times they just flow….and you deserve that.

"
984,14 july 2019,leo,"Playing by the rules may sound like a good plan, and no doubt other people want you to believe that. But do you think that it’s going to take you where you want to go? Don’t be afraid to break a few expectations that others have. They’ll survive, trust me, and you’ll be a heck of a lot happier.

"
985,15 july 2019,leo,"Just one more PUSH!! Yeah, that’s right….give something you’ve been working on a little more muscle today. That’s because tomorrow’s lunar eclipse occurs in your ultra efficient house of getting things done. Today the passionate Moon is in a great position to help you hammer out those last few things that need to happen. Then get a bottle of bubbly, because you deserve to celebrate your hard work.

"
986,16 july 2019,leo,"The big theme for Leos this month is bringing things to an end: health issues, toxic relationships or jobs, procrastination, sloppy habits, all of the things that make us feel off balance. Today’s lunar eclipse is the wrap-up to what may have been lots of effort on your part to get your act together. Kudos! Make sure you lock in new habits and routines, though—old unproductive ones die hard.

"
987,17 july 2019,leo,"Yesterday’s lunar eclipse was all about creating better habits and systems that will make you more efficient. Problem is, Venus–the planet that likes to take the easy route–is whispering in your ear that it’s OK to keep doing things the same old way. No, it’s not! Hey, that’s how procrastination works. Take things one day at a time and you’ll see improvement.

"
988,18 july 2019,leo,"It’s a sexy, sultry day, a good time to get in touch with your inner lioness or lion! With glamorous Venus and amorous Neptune in fine form, it’s also wonderful for pampering and canoodling. Go ahead, indulge yourself.

"
989,19 july 2019,leo,"You’re such a fierce and proud individual that many people assume you’ve got your mental act together, 100%! The reality is that you have fears, sorrows and negative thought patterns, just like everyone else. Mercury retrogrades into the most psychological part of your chart today, encouraging you to “take a look under the hood”, as it were. Probe the corners of your mind for weaknesses and root them out. Your birthday season starts in a few days; it’s time to feel lighter and happier.

"
990,20 july 2019,leo,"Deep down inside you know that things need to change. So why are you fighting it? Uh, maybe it’s the Venus-Pluto opposition in the heavens. Venus likes to take the easy route, whereas Pluto takes a scorched earth, take-no-prisoners path. Somewhere in between there has  to be a happy medium. Find it and start your journey.

"
991,21 july 2019,leo,"OK Leo, in 24 hours the Sun will be in your sign and the party can start. But for now you need to do one last thing, and it’s important. The authoritative Sun and intelligent Mercury line up perfectly in your house of closure and transition. Commit to walking away from situations and people that may be bringing you down. Decide to make a daily habit of performing the kind of inner work that will bring you peace and comfort. Namaste.

"
992,22 july 2019,leo,"YAASSSS!!!! Your birthday season is officially here as the Sun enters Leo. Truth be told, the past year hasn’t been an easy one. But you can make up for it, as high octane Mars is already in your sign and Venus arrives this Saturday. There is a determination about you that is unstoppable, and people around you sense it. You are so  ready to leave the past behind, so whip out the bucket list and write down some new adventures to embark upon!

"
993,23 july 2019,leo,"Your birthday season starts off with a bang! Red hot Mars is in Leo and it forms a terrific aspect with the Moon, which is in the most adventurous part of your chart. What can I say? It seems that the cosmos is encouraging you to take some chances and live a bolder lifestyle. You’re a fixed sign, which means that change doesn’t always come easy. But once Venus enters Leo this weekend, things will flow.

"
994,24 july 2019,leo,"Ready, set……stop? The Sun just entered your sign 48 hours ago and no doubt you’re ready to rumble. But Venus and Mercury decide to hold a secret meeting in the most hush-hush, thoughtful part of your chart. So don’t feel bad about pulling away and spending some time alone as you ponder what to do next, or who you want to be. There is a strong cosmic push urging you to be authentic in all areas of your life.

"
995,25 july 2019,leo,"You are entering an incredibly creative and fun-loving phase, Leo! Yes, the Sun just entered your sign the other day, but that’s not the only reason why things look so enticing. Red hot Mars is in Leo too, and today it forms a fabulous aspect with abundant Jupiter in your house of enjoying life. You’ve been toiling away in the shadows for too long. Live a little!

"
996,26 july 2019,leo,"YAY!! Lively Mercury is now in Leo, and this is a good thing. You have a lot  of thinking to do about your future, probably more than you’ve had before in your adult life. Start contemplating what your next moves will be as there is a game changing solar eclipse arriving on July 3rd.

"
997,27 july 2019,leo,"Oh, the good news just keeps on coming for lions. The Sun entered Leo a few days ago, joining gung-ho Mars. And today luscious Venus joins them. It’s always a good thing when Venus is in your birth sign because it sets the stage for creating a brand new image. Remember how the Cowardly Lion got all dolled up when he reached the Emerald City? It’s time for you to revamp your look.

"
998,28 july 2019,leo,"The Sun, Mars and Venus are all in Leo and they’re acting like a team of cheerleaders. ” 1 2 3 4, let me hear you stomp the floor! 5 6 7 8, Leo’s here and she can’t wait!” Yup, it’s birthday season and there’s nothing holding you back. Even Chiron, the Wounded Healer, is in the mix, telling you to stop selling yourself short.
 
 

"
999,29 july 2019,leo,"The Sun is in your sign and you’re feeling fine. So fine, in fact, that you won’t feel like taking crap from anybody. But that doesn’t mean that everyone is on Team Leo.  A boss, client, authority figure or a smug wannabe may try to burst your shiny red balloon. Don’t let this upset the balance of your precious chi. Shake that mane and sashay off into the sunset instead.

"
1000,30 july 2019,leo,"Not everything is going to make sense today, and that’s OK. Murky Neptune is stirring up the waters of your subconscious mind. The blue planet is helping you wash out old emotions and thoughts that no longer need to be there. So don’t be surprised if random memories and feelings crop up; they’re on the way out!

"
1001,31 july 2019,leo,"What excellent timing! Sometimes the cosmos sends us aspects at the worst possible moment, but in your case it’s just the opposite. Mercury goes direct today in the house of your subconscious mind, which is terrific. You’ve had a lot of mental junk to release so that you can move on with your life. Then tomorrow there’s a new moon in Leo…your annual opportunity to start anew!

"
1002,1 august 2019,leo,"The Leo new moon finally arrives, kicking off a luscious six-month phase in which you can chase after your  dreams. It’s also the best time in 2019 to reinvent your image. But in doing so you may come to realize that some of your previous goals or desires just don’t suit you anymore. A big career change is also a strong possibility. It may be uncomfortable at first to move forward, but nothing ventured, nothing gained!

"
1003,2 august 2019,leo,"Yesterday’s new moon in Leo is opening your mind to fresh possibilities that you may not have considered before. This could be refreshing (“Wow! What a great idea!”) or it could be a bit uncomfortable (“maybe my previous ideas weren’t the best for me”). Change takes courage, my friend, but no other sign of the zodiac has your chutzpah. Next week momentum starts to build….whether you’re ready or not!

"
1004,3 august 2019,leo,"With so much planetary activity in the most creative and fun-loving parts of your chart, chances are you don’t know where to start. So many options….so little time! Fortunately the Moon enters structured Virgo, helping you prioritize. So get out the Birthday Bucket List and pick your top five. Once Wednesday rolls around you’ll be raring to go.

"
1005,4 august 2019,leo,"“Either lead, follow or get out of my way!”  That could easily be your battle cry as aggressive Mars fires you up today. People ought to be listening to you too. Because you’re going to charge ahead with a course of action whether they like it or not. Don’t feel guilty about leaving them in the dust.

"
1006,5 august 2019,leo,"The Moon is in the chattiest part of your chart, which means that you can talk to just about anyone. This includes your writing skills too. Just soften your tone a little bit and play up to people’s emotions. Logic is not as important today as giving people the #feels.

"
1007,6 august 2019,leo,"Your status in the world is changing. People are starting to view you in a new light. The odd thing is, you may not even realize it yet. Don’t sell yourself short, Leo. Don’t be afraid to be fabulous and funny and magnetic!

"
1008,7 august 2019,leo,"Gotta love today’s planetary aspects! The Sun is in your sign, making you fiery and charismatic. El Sol winks at lucky Jupiter in your house of romance and creativity. The energy is fabulous for dazzling suitors, employers, fans and all those wannabes out there. It’s also a great day for having FUN. Remember what “fun” is? I think you need a refresher, so go out and find it.

"
1009,8 august 2019,leo,"The future is so bright, you have to wear shades! That’s the vibe with today’s fabulous Venus-Sun trine. Everything is poised to work out for the best, so if you’re not feeling optimistic, snap out of it.  With lucky Jupiter active in the most creative part of your chart, you’ll be able to find a solution to whatever may be perplexing you. FYI: romance sizzles with these two planets in action.

"
1010,9 august 2019,leo,"Anything is possible for you, Leo. The Sun, Mars and Venus are all in your sign, providing you with confidence and charisma. But Saturn, planet of kudos and rewards, also has your back. The ringed planet is helping you to create the structure and discipline you need. All of this adds up to a pretty sweet, solid situation!

"
1011,10 august 2019,leo,"Stop playing down your abilities, Leo. And don’t be afraid to let your personality shine either. Even though the Sun is in your sign, you may still feel a bit subdued. Do the inner work necessary that will help you feel glorious. You are  fabulous, and it’s high time that you accept it!

"
1012,11 august 2019,leo,"Here’s a sweet birthday gift from the cosmos! Jupiter finally goes direct in your house of love, after several months of being asleep on the job. Your creativity will soar and there will be more time for having fun too. By the way, magnetic Mercury enters Leo today, perfect for updating your image. And Uranus starts to retrograde in your house of goals, which actually is a blessing. It will stop you from jumping all over the place with ideas. Focus is the key.

"
1013,12 august 2019,leo,"Call it “Motivated Monday”, because that’s the kind of energy your sign has going on right now. You’re going to be inspired to catch up on loose ends, and this is a good plan. Planetary aspects later this week call for fun and romance. Get rid of the grunt work now so that you can play later.

"
1014,13 august 2019,leo,"An independent streak is rearing its head, making you crave autonomy. And is that so bad? Others might get a little bent out of shape, but they’ll get over it. Right now you need to pursue your own agenda, not to mention some personal down time.

"
1015,14 august 2019,leo,"“Damn, I’m good! The future’s so bright, I have to wear shades.” That’s the kind of upbeat attitude you could have today Leo, and you deserve it. The fiery Sun, your ruler, meets up with glamorous Venus in your sign. There’s nothing wrong with looking good and feeling good, and hell—showing it off too! So venture out and enjoy yourself. It’s a birthday gift from the cosmos.

"
1016,15 august 2019,leo,"Who’s on Team Leo? That’s the question raised by the Aquarius full moon. Aquarius is your opposite sign, the house that deals with close personal relationships. You could solidify situations with people (like getting engaged or entering into a business alliance). But you could also walk away from situations in which you’re doing all of the giving and not getting anything back. The decision is yours to make.

"
1017,16 august 2019,leo,"Don’t let criticism from others throw you off your game, Leo–even if it comes from higher up. With intelligent Mercury active in your sign, you know what’s going on. Which may precisely be why others are in a snit: they know that you’re right. Don’t rub their noses in it as this will only make things worse. Just smile sweetly and go about your day.

"
1018,17 august 2019,leo,"Duty calls and you may be saying “screw you!” Yup, you won’t feel like doing anything today that smacks of discipline and hard work. My advice is to relax and have some fun this weekend. Do it now, because next week Mars moves into one of the most structured, hard-working parts of your chart.

"
1019,18 august 2019,leo,"Show me the money, honey! That’s your new battle cry as motivator Mars barrels into your house of cash. A word of warning here: the tendency to overspend is always an issue with Mars in this sector, so be careful. But you can also make enormous strides when it comes to landing a higher paying job or starting a business of your own. Venus, planet of profits, and the Sun arrive later this week. Get ready for a busy month ahead.

"
1020,19 august 2019,leo,"The Sun will be leaving your sign in a few days, but that’s nothing to get upset about. An inspirational Moon-Mercury aspect opens your mind to fresh possibilities for the next year, things that you may not have considered before. The purpose of being on Earth is to grow as a person. Are you ready to try some new things?

"
1021,20 august 2019,leo,"Letting everyone know what’s going on may not be the smartest move right now, Leo. With so much planetary firepower in your sign you may feel as though you can’t go wrong. But discretion is needed right now. As for listening to other people’s opinions, avoid that as well. You have a good handle on things and don’t need distractions.

"
1022,21 august 2019,leo,"You know deep inside that it’s time to take things up to the next level. Maybe it’s a romance or your career. Perhaps it’s your lifestyle. And you certainly don’t lack the smarts or courage to do so. What are you waiting for? Get on with it already!

"
1023,22 august 2019,leo,"This is the Sun’s last day in your sign, and before it moves on it leaves a gift at your doorstep: inner peace. You’ve been doing a lot of work lately on your emotions. Truth be told, the work is not yet done. But you’ve made progress and will continue to do so, especially during the Virgo period. Greater serenity and mindfulness will  be yours.

"
1024,23 august 2019,leo,"Get ready, Leo! You are entering into one of the most prosperous times I’ve ever seen in your chart. The Sun is now in Virgo, your second house of making and saving more money. Powerful forces are at work helping you to get ahead. Next week could bring some amazing events your way; make sure that you’re ready to talk about big bucks.

"
1025,24 august 2019,leo,"Security never looked so sexy. A wonderful meet up of Mars and Venus in one of the most stable parts of your chart will set off sparks, Leo! Maybe you’ll meet a mature, grounded but soulful lover. Perhaps an engagement is coming your way. Even job prospects look firmer and more profitable. FYI: this energy only gets better in the weeks ahead.

"
1026,25 august 2019,leo,"A powerful career and money phase opens up this week and continues well into September. Today Chiron, the Wounded Healer, asks where you’ve been playing it too safe. Leos are a fixed sign and don’t take to change too easily. But sitting on the sidelines watching everyone else live a bold life and crushing it isn’t your MO either.

"
1027,26 august 2019,leo,"Confidence is sexy and do you ever have it today! A luscious Venus-Uranus aspect ratchets up your charisma, not only in romance but in business too. It ain’t easy being a show stopper but you were born for this level of adulation. Oh, and here’s the best part: it continues all week long. 

"
1028,27 august 2019,leo,"Deadlines and responsibilities could feel like the 800-pound gorilla in the room right now. With the Moon in the most restful part of your chart, you probably just want to crawl into bed and take a nap! Hey, it you need rest take it, but just for today. Tomorrow things start to heat up as big plans of yours gain traction.

"
1029,28 august 2019,leo,"Mars and Uranus are the two most energetic, assertive planets in the solar system. When they’re at war with each other it’s time to duck for cover. But when they’re in bromance mode–which is the case this week–you’re in luck. It just so happens that they’re active in your houses of making money career progress and  solidifying romance. It’s time to grab what’s rightfully yours!

"
1030,29 august 2019,leo,"Money talks and right now it’s screaming at you, Leo! Shrewd Mercury has just joined the fiery Sun in your income sector. You should be doing whatever it takes to start pulling in more cash. There could be some unexpected surprises coming your way: an important person who believes in you, for instance, or hitting upon a genius idea. Focus more on increasing your cash flow than long term deals that could take forever to pull off.

"
1031,30 august 2019,leo,"Yes! The Virgo new moon is all about making more money and enjoying success in your career. But what’s the best way to get ahead? Murky Neptune could be confusing matters, making it hard to see the path ahead. Take your time and don’t get frustrated. As long as you’re not expecting overnight success, you’ll know what to do by September 14th.

"
1032,31 august 2019,leo,"Don’t beat yourself up if you can’t make up your mind about something. Funky Neptune is active in one of the most emotional parts of your chart. As a result a small battle is being between logic and feelings. If you can, avoid making major decisions today and hold off til next week, when things will become a lot clearer.

"
1033,1 september 2019,leo,"Doing things the same old way will only get you more of what you’ve already got. In other words, things will stay the same. Is that what you want?! I didn’t think so. It’s time to be a bit more adventurous when it comes to major life goals, and this includes romance, career and travel. Fortunately logical Saturn is in a good place to help you come up with a realistic way to get things that may have seemed impossible.

"
1034,2 september 2019,leo,"You are entering into a wonderful period in which you can build a lot of security in your life: financial, romantic and emotional, for starters. Your motivation level is high and you’re on the right track. Which is why you need to avoid people and situations that are too dramatic. It’s also critical to avoid fairyland type thinking. Keep it real and sane, and you’ll be fine.

"
1035,3 september 2019,leo,"You are currently in one of the most practical phases your sign has seen in a long time, Leo. Reality counts. So do rituals, habits and systems that work. If anyone tries to tell you to “just go with the flow”, remind them that sewage flows though pipes. Otherwise just keep hammering away at the things that need your undivided attention.

"
1036,4 september 2019,leo,"Don’t kid yourself about your finances, Leo. A Venus-Jupiter opposition could create confusion about a job, investments or cash flow. If you’re negotiating a job offer, mortgage, court award or anything else that has money attached, you need more facts—and they will be hard to come by today. Tomorrow and Friday are much better days for digging deep and getting the intel you need.

"
1037,5 september 2019,leo,"It’s back to school time for the kids but your chart has the same kind of energy! It’s all about trying new methods, digging into projects and feeling good when you’ve finished something. This is true at work and at home, but also with your health and fitness levels. Anyone who thinks that you’re a lazy, languid lion is in for a shock.

"
1038,6 september 2019,leo,"From your chart it appears that you’re overthinking. This happens a lot when we’re stressed, but it can also happen when we’re having fabulous daydreams (the realistic kind) about our future. Shut down your brain for a few days and forget about it. The answers will come more quickly if you just let them flow in effortlessly.

"
1039,1 january 2019,virgo,"Welcome to a new year, a time when inner peace and contentment will count for a lot. With powerful planets lined up in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, you’re going to be craving stability in 2019. This is true especially within your family, romance and residential situation. Drama just isn’t going to cut it for you.

"
1040,2 january 2019,virgo,"Let’s face it, sometimes you just have to be super rational when it comes to romance. It can’t be champagne and caviar all the time. The good news is that the two most logical orbs in the solar system, the Sun and Saturn, are meeting up in your house of love. It’s a great day for making serious decisions about the future. Likewise, if you’re single and looking, it’s a smart time to create a short list of the qualities that you simply must have been a mate.

"
1041,3 january 2019,virgo,"Family members or a lover could be difficult today, and you may be wondering if you did anything to create this. Whether you did or didn’t, know that this little tempest in a teapot passes quickly. As a matter fact, it’s gone by tomorrow. Friday is a much better time for talking things over.

"
1042,4 january 2019,virgo,"Woo-hoo! Things get juicy and fun as vivacious Mercury glides into your house of amour. This is just an appetizer for the big “meal”: a solar eclipse in this house next Monday. This sector also governs shopping, going out on the town, and creative pursuits. Enjoy.

"
1043,5 january 2019,virgo,"Holding your thoughts and feelings back? You could be, as a result of a Chiron aspect. Chiron is known as the wounded healer, and when it’s activated it brings up stuff that’s deep within. The good news is that the lines of communication are starting to open, so don’t be afraid to speak up.

"
1044,6 january 2019,virgo,"Love heats up big time thanks to two amazing cosmic aspects today. The first is a solar eclipse in your house of romance, fun and flirting. The second is the fact that Uranus goes direct in your house of sex and intimacy. Yowza! To say that the breaks are off is an understatement. Things can start happening at lightning like speed. Hope you’re ready.

"
1045,7 january 2019,virgo,"Despite the fact that yesterday’s eclipse occurred in your house of flirtation and fun, you could be feeling more interested in tradition and security. That’s because Venus enters your domestic sector, making you crave a strong foundation….in addition to desiring the juicy stuff too!

"
1046,8 january 2019,virgo,"Yikes! Emotions will be going all over the place today, either on your part or on the part of others. Be careful what you say and do, as you can end up feeding this fire and make it worse. Things improve tomorrow; wait 24 hours.

"
1047,9 january 2019,virgo,"Something that has been bothering you may quickly dissipate. Not everything in your mind is (a) real or (b) worth getting worked up over.

"
1048,10 january 2019,virgo,"Cooperation and commitment could increase under today’s productive lunar aspect. This is true in your personal life as well as your professional one. If you feel as though you need help with something, don’t be afraid to ask for it.

"
1049,11 january 2019,virgo,"You are currently enjoying a lot of planetary activity and your fun, frisky fifth house of romance. There is a light-hearted air about this sector, which makes it perfect for flirting and partying. But a serious Pluto aspect today indicates that you need to get real when it comes to romance. Really real.

"
1050,12 january 2019,virgo,"Sometimes you just have to let loose and follow your passions, and that’s what the cosmos wants you to do this weekend. You’ve been working hard and playing by the rules; now it’s time to do what makes your heart sing.

"
1051,13 january 2019,virgo,"What really floats your boat, Virgo? Living a passionless life is no way to go. Consider what you can do to make your existence on this planet more exciting….without doing something stupid! (LOL)

"
1052,14 january 2019,virgo,"The cosmos has been conspiring to help you develop your talent. Everyone has some kind of special ability, and it’s time for you to find yours. It wouldn’t hurt to team up with somebody else who is creative too. You could both learn from each other.

"
1053,15 january 2019,virgo,"“Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all!” So said Helen Keller, who transcended her limits and lived an amazing life. With the Moon in your house of taking risks, this is an excellent time for pushing yourself past your own boundaries.

"
1054,16 january 2019,virgo,"A Pluto-Sun meet-up in your house of romance and creativity could transform the way you view your talent level AND love life. Pretty neat, huh? But you won’t know unless you try. Fortunately the Moon is in the most adventurous part of your chart. Vamanos!

"
1055,17 january 2019,virgo,"This may seem as though you can’t keep anybody happy today, Virgo. Let it go. By tomorrow your mood will improve and you won’t care what anyone thinks!

"
1056,18 january 2019,virgo,"Want more love, juicier romantic moments and a happier lifestyle? Then you need to demand it, baby! Tough guy Pluto is telling you to stop waiting for your ship to come in. Swim out to meet it instead. Otherwise you’ll be waiting a long time.

"
1057,19 january 2019,virgo,"
Be selective about whom you spend time with this weekend. Friends, family and lovers could be way too emo and erratic. Avoid known malcontents and stick with the saner people.

"
1058,20 january 2019,virgo,"
The Sun is now in the most can-do part of your chart. But unless everyone around you happens to be a Virgo too, they won’t be jumping to get things done. Which means that you might have to do things by yourself….at least until Thursday, when you put them into place.

"
1059,21 january 2019,virgo,"
Over the past two years you may have gone through a lot of changes, the kind that are deep within. It may not have been easy. But here’s some good news…a lunar eclipse in Leo brings this cycle to an end. Between now and the time of your birthday, you can experience a rebirth–mentally, emotionally and physically.

"
1060,23 january 2019,virgo,"
Trying to talk sense to someone could backfire today, Virgo. On the flip side, someone may try to talk sense to you… and it will go nowhere! Fortunately this aspect will be gone within 24 hours. Intelligent Mercury glides into the most practical part of your chart tomorrow, so you’ll be clear and resolute.

"
1061,24 january 2019,virgo,"
Whistle while you work! Getting things done becomes a snap now that lively Mercury is in your house of efficiency and habits. This is true even of diet and exercise. If getting fit is one of your goals for 2019, now is a terrific time to start.

"
1062,25 january 2019,virgo,"
Residential and family matters get a huge boost from motivated Mars and lucky Jupiter. The next few days are great for finding your dream home or getting approved for a mortgage. Family battles could finally be ended. And love shines too as you and a lover could agree to live together.

"
1063,26 january 2019,virgo,"
Keep the plastic at home and watch your spending. Keep your eyes on your own lover and off of someone else’s! Temptation could be strong to do things that are a bit risky. This is not the time or place.

"
1064,27 january 2019,virgo,"
If at first you don’t succeed then try, try again! That’s the message from the cosmos today. Think about what you’re doing right and what you’re doing wrong. Then make the necessary adjustments.

"
1065,28 january 2019,virgo,"
No matter how much you may feel like telling someone off, take a deep breath instead. Then count to 10, slowly. A lunar aspect recommends switching up your methods of communication, just a little bit. This is more for the benefit of your peace of mind than their’s.

"
1066,29 january 2019,virgo,"
You may need to be the logical, calm one who pulls everyone together today. “So what else is new?” you ask. Hey, the mighty Sun and intelligent Mercury are both in your efficiency sector. Unless you’re dealing with nothing but Virgos, you’re going to be the most pulled together person in the room.

"
1067,30 january 2019,virgo,"
Is there a domestic goddess or god hiding inside of you? It sure looks that way from your chart. Housing and decorating matters are well aspected as abundant Jupiter winks at the Moon. 

"
1068,31 january 2019,virgo,"
People need to know that you have emotions, so don’t be afraid to show them. It’s truly the only way to build stronger relationships. With mature Saturn by your side, your words carry weight.

"
1069,1 february 2019,virgo,"
Emotions will be going all over the place, and people could be argumentative. Choose your battles wisely. After all, once the words leave your mouth you can’t take them back.

"
1070,2 february 2019,virgo,"
If you need money for home-related expenses, start to think creatively today. Uranus, the planet of brilliant ideas, could inspire you with a good one. And this includes asking to borrow cash from a family member. Hey, they might actually help!

"
1071,3 february 2019,virgo,"
Heaven knows you’re efficient. And with the Sun and Mercury in your house of organization, you’re even more productive than usual. But luscious Venus glides into your house of fun and romance today. It’s time to schedule more playtime!

"
1072,4 february 2019,virgo,"
Today’s new Moon occurs in your house of wellness. So if you fell off the diet and exercise wagon right after New Year’s Day, it’s time to get back on it. This is the best time all year to get back in shape and to feel better. From your chart it appears that teaming up with an exercise buddy is a good plan.

"
1073,5 february 2019,virgo,"
You may need to take control of a group effort or something at the office. If people can’t stick to the task, the role or the budget, problems will occur down the road. You’re in a good place to calmly set them on the right track.

Play nice with others today, even if it kills you. With so much planetary activity in your efficiency zone, you’re determined to get things done. Don’t run over others in the process. Besides, you may need them–so smile.

"
1075,7 february 2019,virgo,"
Life is always a lot easier when people are cooperating with each other, isn’t it? A happy Sun-Jupiter aspect is designed to pull people together. You may need to be the driving force behind this, but isn’t that better than mass chaos? Or doing all of the grunt work by yourself? 

"
1076,8 february 2019,virgo,"
Put your money where your mouth is, Virgo. If you say that you’re going to do something to increase your net worth, then make it happen. The time for talking is over. Put one foot in front of the other and push forward.

"
1077,9 february 2019,virgo,"
It’s time to take a good long look at your mental attitude. Are you always focusing on what’s wrong? Do you dwell on the past? Do you react to things emotionally, or logically? Fortunately, brilliant Uranus wants to bring about fast change. Roll with it.

"
1078,10 february 2019,virgo,"
Try to make nice with other people, Virgo. Diplomacy counts for a lot over the next five weeks. However, that doesn’t mean that you need to reveal all of your thoughts to others. Keep some intel to yourself.

"
1079,12 february 2019,virgo,"
You are SO ready to break away from old circumstances, Virgo. It’s almost like a revolt is brewing! But this one won’t leave you or anyone else bloodied on the battlefield. No, this has a fun, devil-may-care feeling about it. So go ahead and have an adventure.

"
1080,18 february 2019,virgo,"
Don’t try to go it all alone, Virgo. With the Sun now in your house of partnering, you should be teaming up with other people. Ask for help if you need it. This is especially true when it comes to your love life. Wonderful aspects in the week ahead encourage cooperation.

1081,26 february 2019,virgo,"
With healing Jupiter active in your house of inner contentment, it will be easier to feel as though you’re in control of things. This is a very sensitive house overall, but you should feel calm. Maybe you’re starting to realize that there are some things in life not worth getting upset about.

"
1082,27 february 2019,virgo,"
You could be feeling far more social than usual these days, Virgo…..and there’s nothing wrong with that! Chances are you’re craving new experiences with a different breed of people. This is a smart move, as making new connections could broaden your mind immensely.

"
1083,3 march 2019,virgo,"
It’s time to stop sweeping things under the rug, Virgo. This is especially true with your closest relationships. Mercury is getting ready to go retrogradeIn your house of commitment. Try to get everything out in the air and settled before Wednesday if you can.

"
1084,10 march 2019,virgo,"
There is a lot of planetary energy going on that is encouraging you to mix it up with lots of new people (not to mention the other people who are already in your world). Some real movers and shakers could come into your life over the next week. Strike up a conversation with them!

"
1085,11 march 2019,virgo,"

"
1086,13 march 2019,virgo,"
Passion meets logic with a happy Mars-Saturn aspect. Don’t let anyone tell you that your ideas are crazy; they might actually be attainable. Saturn will help point out any weaknesses and Mars will give you the drive you need.

"
1087,14 march 2019,virgo,"
If anyone in your world needs to hear the unvarnished truth, today’s the day to give them the reality check that they need. No drama, no yelling–chill Mercury is on the case. But be aware that it may be YOU who needs to wake up and smell the coffee.

Right now you may feel as though you have one nerve left, and everyone is working it! You may love your family and your friends, but geez, they’re acting wonky this week. Let this pass, because things improve tomorrow.

"
1089,16 march 2019,virgo,"
If people call you up and say “let’s go out and have fun”, who are you to say no? With Pluto active in your house of enjoying life, you definitely need to get out of the house. You work plenty hard. Now it’s time to relax.

"
1090,17 march 2019,virgo,"
Details matter, especially to a picky sign like yours. But there is a time to toss the small things aside and focus on the big picture, and that time is now. Mars is cruising through your house of grand ideas. Don’t get caught up in minutia or what other people think.

"
1091,18 march 2019,virgo,"
Right now is a good time to reflect upon the state of your emotional health. Are you plagued with worries, fears or negative emotions? Then it’s time for some detox. Once the Sun enters Aries on Wednesday, you should do everything you can to create more mindfulness and peace.

"
1092,19 march 2019,virgo,"

"
1096,23 march 2019,virgo,"
Ouch! Be careful about voicing off, something that could happen with erratic Uranus in a stinky mood. Your opinions or ideas may not go over very well with others, no matter how intelligent or positively intentioned they might be. Keep those gems to yourself.

Need to add some spice to your relationship? Amorous Neptune is in a good place to help. It gets even better on Tuesday: the other planet of romance, Venus, glides into your commitment sector. Singles, don’t despair….a new lover could come your way on Thursday of this week.

And today assertive Mars zips into your ambition and goals sector. This is truly one of the best times in 2019 to get ahead. Don’t be surprised if other people want to partner with you on your journey.

"
1101,7 april 2019,virgo," Set aside some time to have calm, clear discussions with the ones you love today. Mature Saturn forms a terrific aspect with verbal Mercury. Try to clear the air if you can. Later this week there will be some wonky energy when things could get way too emotional.

"
1102,8 april 2019,virgo,"With the moon in the most visionary part of your chart, you’re able to see things that other people around you may not. Keep this in mind as the week progresses. Others will be emotional, but you’ll be rock solid.

"
1103,9 april 2019,virgo,"Someone has to be the grown up around here and it might as well be you! A Sun-Saturn square could bring out the whining crybabies in people. Do you really feel like dealing with this? If not, then let them just sit in their “poopy pants” diapers and move on.

"
1106,12 april 2019,virgo,"Get ready–– people in your midst could be bragging and bloviating. The smartest move you can make is to not respond to their nonsense. Why waste your time? However, pay close attention to what your intuition is telling you about these people.

"
1107,13 april 2019,virgo,"People may not be above using guilt, drama or fear to get their way. The question is this: are you going to fall for it?

1108,14 april 2019,virgo,"Worrying about things that may not happen is a waste of time, and stressful to boot. So ask yourself why you have the same old repetitive thoughts going on in your head! Today’s cosmic energy is good for emotional healing. Practice being more of an optimist.

"
1109,15 april 2019,virgo,"Everyone may want a piece of you today, but the danger is that you’ll spread yourself too thin. Which means that you won’t be able to keep everyone happy. So go your own way and just worry about pleasing yourself.

"
1110,16 april 2019,virgo,"If loved ones aren’t straightforward with you, chances are you’re going to flip out. A Moon-Neptune opposition stirs up some pretty murky waters, not to mention strong emotions. Let this pass. Tomorrow is a better time for getting to the bottom of things.

"
1111,17 april 2019,virgo,"The next three weeks are excellent for taking calculated risks, Virgo. Smart little Mercury enters your house of net worth, to be followed by Venus on Saturday.  You could be exposed to some new investment ideas that you have never even considered before. Don’t worry, you won’t do anything stupid…you’re far too practical for that! But it wouldn’t hurt to expand your idea as to what is possible.

"
1112,18 april 2019,virgo,"If money has been slipping through your fingers, you could get emotional about it today. The planets are pushing you to create a stronger financial foundation. Good news: tomorrow’s full moon is in your income sector, which could bring about a new source of revenue.

"
1113,19 april 2019,virgo,"The full moon in your income sector could bring in a new job or source of revenues. But you may have to move out of your comfort zone in order to make things happen. Are you ready to do that?

"
1114,20 april 2019,virgo,"It’s time to get out of the dreaming stage and get into the “doing” stage. Today’s full moon occurs in the most visionary part of your chart, the place where we think in big, bold brushstrokes. But full moons represent endings, so prepare to actually dive in.

"
1115,21 april 2019,virgo,"You need to release some pent up emotions, and today’s lunar aspect gives you the chance to safely do so. Don’t be embarrassed about letting it all out. People need to know what’s going on, especially the ones whose behavior has been hurtful.

"
1116,22 april 2019,virgo,"Nothing is going to get in your way….absolutely nothing! The independent Sun shakes hands with rebellious Uranus in your house of taking risks, vowing to bust you out of old grooves. The next few weeks (and years) could be some of the most liberating ever.

"
1117,23 april 2019,virgo,"Feeling all mushy and sentimental? You could be, thanks to a meeting of the passionate Moon and Jupiter. Tender memories from the past could be abundant, as you think back to your family and love affairs of days gone by. It’s a good time to take out old photos and mementos. Why keep them hidden away? Maybe you could create a little shrine to the people (and pets) who filled your life with joy.

"
1118,25 april 2019,virgo,"New Year’s Eve in April? It could feel like it today as a lunar aspect spurs a desire to turn over a new leaf. Don’t be surprised if you become motivated to work out and clean up your messes. This feeling will intensify, so get used to it!

"
1119,26 april 2019,virgo,"People will be at odds with each other, and if I were you I’d stay out of their dramas. Playing the role of peacemaker or trusted friend won’t help matters. They need to figure stuff out on their own and move on already.

"
1120,27 april 2019,virgo,"You might feel like seizing control over things—and people–because you feel as though you know what’s best. And you know what? You may be right about that! Problem is, others won’t accept it right now. Do you really want to get involved in this? Your energy may be better spent elsewhere.

"
1121,28 april 2019,virgo,"It’s one thing to be a good friend, son, daughter, lover, whatever—and another to be taken for granted. You also weren’t put on this planet to fix everyone around you, so get that idea out of your head too. Be caring to others but maintain some boundaries.

"
1122,29 april 2019,virgo,"You are a practical sort, not given to diva-like displays of drama and emotion. So today’s planetary news won’t ruin your day. Saturn goes retrograde in your house of romance, demanding that you become more practical about matters of the heart. This could slow down brand new relationships or even existing ones. But Saturn’s goal is to make sure that you’re with the right person and that this union will stand the test of time.

"
1123,30 april 2019,virgo,"Hurry up and wait? It’s that kind of a day, Virgo. The harder you push someone–for an answer, to get things done your way, whatever–the more stalling and BS you’re going to endure. My advice? Back off.

"
1124,1 may 2019,virgo,"You’re in the mood for making mo’ money, lots of it. And there is nothing wrong with that! So start thinking about what you can do to increase your net worth, but keep emotions out of it. This needs to be a logical play.

"
1125,2 may 2019,virgo,"People won’t be above playing head games, so don’t assume that everyone is guileless. On the contrary: they have agendas that they intend to fulfill. Unless you want to get run over, get out of their way.

"

Family members may not agree with your plans, but you don’t have to do things their way!

"
1128,5 may 2019,virgo,"Aggressive Mars is in your house of ambition and success, stoking your desire to get what you want. But don’t forget to be a team player. If you do forget that fact, there are plenty of people who will be happy to put you in your place.

"
1129,6 may 2019,virgo,"Planetary pileup! There is a bit of commotion going on in your ninth house of adventure and expanding past previous limits. The independent Sun is there and so is rebellious, bold Uranus.  A new moon just occurred here a few days ago. Now lively Mercury hops on in. What are you waiting for? Start having escapades1

"
1130,7 may 2019,virgo,"Don’t let people drag you into dramas, Virgo. You just don’t need this right now. Mature Saturn is retrograde, helping you to step away from people and situations that are more trouble than they’re worth.

"
1131,8 may 2019,virgo,"If there is one day in 2019 to unshackle yourself from limiting situations, this is it!

Align yourself with others who know how to think out of the box too.

"
1132,9 may 2019,virgo,"Anyone who wants to interrupt your life with egotistical demands and power plays needs to be shown the door, Virgo. With cathartic Jupiter and gentle Venus in houses that govern inner peace, you’re just not interested in drama. Protect your emotional balance at all costs.

"
1133,10 may 2019,virgo,"Jealousy and pettiness could rear their ugly little heads today, on your part or on the part of others. If you’re not looking for extra stress and drama right now, then by all means avoid known malcontents. The mood shifts tomorrow and a lot of fun can be had.

"
1134,11 may 2019,virgo,"Taking intelligent risks becomes a real possibility with a super Sun-Saturn trine. Over the next week you’ll be able to come up with a lot of fresh, creative ideas that look tempting. And with motivated Mars in your house of ambition, nothing is going to get in your way!

"
1135,12 may 2019,virgo,"Don’t be surprised if you feel like sleeping in and staying under the covers. Breakfast in bed…staying in your jammies all day…watching Netflix with some popcorn….yeah, it’s that kind of a day. Chill out and relax. Don’t worry, your responsibilities will still be there tomorrow.

"
1136,13 may 2019,virgo,"Who knew? Even you might be surprised at your level of skill and creativity today. But it’s not really surprising. With subterranean Pluto helping to bring out your best from the depths of your soul, you’re a winner.

"
1137,14 may 2019,virgo,"Aggressive Mars spends its last day in your house of ambition, signaling that it’s time to put one last blast of effort into important plans. “But I’m tired!” you might cry. Don’t worry. Tomorrow the red planet zips into your house of hanging out with friends and partying.
 

"
1138,15 may 2019,virgo,"Bonnie and Clyde. Butch and Sundance. Thelma and Louise. Holmes and Watson. What kind of adventures would they have had if they were flying solo? Nope, having an accomplice is a good way to experience more excitement. Today Mars enters your house of friends and teamwork, and Venus glides into your house of adventure. Looks like it’s time to find a kindred spirit who’s willing to do something audacious with you.

"
1139,16 may 2019,virgo,"Tell it like it is, Virgo. There’s no point in tiptoeing around the truth. But if you also have bold idea that other people think is crazy—and it’s YOUR truth–then don’t be shy about that either.

"
1140,17 may 2019,virgo,"People have to understand that you just need to live your own life, Virgo. You’re willing to cooperate with others. But rolling over and playing dead for them is just not going to happen. Be diplomatic when you tell them that, OK?

"
1141,18 may 2019,virgo,"Got a message to get out to the world? Full of bright ideas that should see the light of day? Then you’ll love the full moon in Scorpio. Something that you’ve been working on could bring you recognition. Or you could decide on a whim to do something outrageous, something that other people say “can’t be done”. It can, and you’re just the person to pull it off.

"
1142,19 may 2019,virgo,"You don’t need anyone’s permission to be you, Virgo. The Sun is in the most individualistic, adventurous part of your chart. But people around you may still be viewing you in an old, tired way. You can either wait for them to figure it out or you can move on.

"
1143,20 may 2019,virgo,"You know what you  want, that’s for sure! Too bad others can’t figure out what they’d like in their lives. Today is not a good time to give advice, not is it wise to listen to what others have to say. They’re confused….do you want to end up the same way?

"
1144,21 may 2019,virgo,"Career matters and other big goals take off like a rocket, Virgo! Both the Sun and intelligent Mercury just entered your house of ambition and success. The words “no” or “it can’t be done” won’t be in your vocabulary. And if other people try to slow down your progress, you’ll either ignore them or run them over.

"
1145,22 may 2019,virgo,"Two heads are better than one, and three is even better than that! That’s the message from the cosmos, Virgo. Brainstorming with others is the way to go, whether you’re planning a family reunion or trying to launch a new product or service. Some really audacious ideas could could come out of it too!

"
1146,23 may 2019,virgo,"You could feel moody and withdrawn today, and hanging out with a crowd may not be the best way to go! You’re better off tucking yourself away somewhere that’s quiet. If you want to confide in a friend, make sure it’s one who will listen and not tell you how to think or feel.

"
1147,24 may 2019,virgo,"Are people around you floating on a fluffy pink cloud, completely oblivious to the facts of life? And are you trying to explain those facts to them? I wish you luck, my friend. No matter how hard you try to talk sense into people, it’s not going to work. Furthermore, it’s a waste of time listening to these people and their opinions. Let it go and move on to people who have a clue.

"
1148,25 may 2019,virgo,"You need to get things done today. Knock errands and other boring activities off your list early so that you can enjoy the rest of the weekend. But be sure to rest up, as the upcoming week is going to be very active. You’ll have places to go, people to meet and world domination to consider.

"
1149,26 may 2019,virgo,"Are you being a bit over cautious, Virgo? With moody Chiron in your house of romance and finances, you might be holding back a bit. Fortunately, the Sun forms a terrific aspect with Chiron today, bolstering your confidence.

"
1150,27 may 2019,virgo,"Some new people could be coming into your life, and they could inspire you tremendously. As a result, you need to keep an open mind. And you need to get out there too: go to a meet up group. Attend a seminar. Join a Facebook forum. Get politically involved in your town. Lend a hand to a worthy cause. It’s all good.

"
1151,28 may 2019,virgo,"You may not feel like socializing or being a team player, Virgo. A Jupiter-Moon square could make other people annoying as hell. Even if they’re being nice, you may want to pull away and be in your own space. The problem is that you do need to cooperate with others. Suck it up and deal with it. By Thursday you’ll be in a completely different state of mind.

"
1152,30 may 2019,virgo,"Today you will have to push past comfort and doing things the same old way. Growth isn’t always easy, and rigid habits and thought patterns die hard. But with the Sun in your house of success, you simply must switch up your methods.

"
1153,31 may 2019,virgo,"Doing things the same old way just isn’t cutting it anymore, especially in romance and in business. Today you might even feel as though the spirits are whispering in your ear, telling you to be brave and take a fresh viewpoint. Why not? What do you have to lose? Nothing great has ever been achieved by following the same old tired set of rules.

"
1154,1 june 2019,virgo,"Opposing forces are working on you right now. On the one hand you want to stick with someone or something. On the other, you feel as though it’s time for a change. Interestingly this seems to work out nicely in the end, so don’t think that you need to toss everything at the moment.

"
1155,2 june 2019,virgo,"Talent that you may not have known that you even possessed could come to the surface! You are in a wonderfully creative place right now, willing to take on new things that will push you past previous limits. You could also be willing to take a chance in the love department, because you’re starting to realize that, just like talent, you have so much more to give.

"
1156,3 june 2019,virgo,"Who’s the boss, anyway? That’s the question asked by today’s new moon in Gemini. This lunation occurs in your tenth house of ambition and success. Your creativity is high and you’re willing to take some chances. But a lover, family member or friend could try to burst your bubble. Are you going to let that happen?

"
1157,4 june 2019,virgo,"Yesterday’s new Moon occurred in your house of goals and achievement. And today mighty little Mercury glides into your house of networking and friends. This means that other people could be the key to your success over the next six months. Surround yourself with movers and shakers, and people who have your back. Find people who have what you want and model their success.

"
1158,5 june 2019,virgo,"Things could get heated with a friend, colleague or team member. Aggressive Mars could push you to or say something that you might regret. Jealousy and pettiness could rear their ugly little heads too. Wait until tomorrow when the cosmic skies are clearer and more optimistic.

"
1159,6 june 2019,virgo,"Sometimes making changes can feel like a cold bucket of water is being tossed on your head. Other times it can be as smooth as silk. With gentle Venus by your side, you can easily glide into a new way of living. Need to be held accountable? Then find a trusted friend who you can check in with. Or maybe they’ll even want to join you on your journey.

"
1160,7 june 2019,virgo,"Your opinions matter so don’t be afraid to share them (at least for the next 48 hours!). A terrific Uranus-Mercury aspect could bring you together with people who would love to know what’s on your mind. Together you could be a formidable team.

"
1161,11 june 2019,virgo,"This is not time to rest on your laurels, Virgo. Yes, you’re smart and accomplished, and yes, you’ve proven that to other people. But a Sun-Jupiter opposition warns that you still have to keep delivering the goods. You can’t slack off until the Sun changes signs on the 21st.

"
1162,12 june 2019,virgo,"Say what’s on your mind! Others need to know what you’re thinking. Besides, they may need to look up to someone who is a good example—and that person is you.

"
1163,13 june 2019,virgo,"Your confidence rises as you realize that you have more personal power than you knew! The great thing about feeling more secure is that it encourages you to take risks, the kind that come from a place of creative exploration. Fortunately this isn’t an aspect that just lasts a day: you’ll be experiencing this for a good long while.

"
1164,14 june 2019,virgo,"Chances are you’re getting tired of listening to people who are factual and logical all of the time. “Play by the rules, do the right thing, stick to a routine”…..yada yada dada. Start spending more time with people who are more flexible in their philosophy. You might learn something from them.

"
1165,15 june 2019,virgo,"Upcoming planetary events will force you to take a good long look at your closest relationships, from friends to lovers to colleagues. If anyone is making you feel uneasy, or like you’re not worth much, then it may be time to move on. It’s not your karma in life to be a doormat. Remember that.

"
1166,16 june 2019,virgo,"Team efforts and friendships are well aspected today, so make the most of it. You may be faced with a choice: who do I spend time with this week? My tribe, my lover or business colleagues? If you’re smart you’ll do a little scheduling to make sure that everyone gets some time with you.

"
1167,17 june 2019,virgo,"Home and family matters take center stage thanks to the full moon in your domestic sector. This house also governs love to a certain extent, especially if you are living with a lover or you’re married. There could be some confusion that makes your relationships with others a bit tense. Things get back on track when the Sun enters Cancer on Friday.

"
1168,18 june 2019,virgo,"You may need to point out the facts of life to other people today. But don’t discount their ideas; there could be some real gems there. Pay even more attention to what others are saying after the Sun enters Cancer on Friday.

"
1169,19 june 2019,virgo,"Unless you enjoy drama, try to steer clear of people who seem intent on stirring it up. A stinky Mars-Pluto opposition could bring out jealousy, disagreements and petty behavior, not to mention bossy behavior. Cosmic energy improves by the weekend, so ride out this storm and wait for fairer skies.

"
1170,20 june 2019,virgo,"Be wary of sticking out from the crowd today, Virgo. No one is telling you to be a wimp or to take a lot of guff. But you’re better off keeping your mouth shut for the next 48 hours and going along with group think. 

"
1171,21 june 2019,virgo,"An independent streak builds as the Sun enters Cancer, your house of networking and having fun with friends. If you’re involved in a romantic relationship, the desire to do your own thing could increase. Neptune starts retrograding in your commitment sector, which will only add to this sense of doing your own thing.

"
1172,22 june 2019,virgo,"The Moon in Pisces will make you crave the company of others, so don’t spend the weekend alone. And make sure that you are present for the people you care about the most. Don’t let your job or other stressors get in the way of spending quality time with loved ones.

"
1173,23 june 2019,virgo,"Subtle power plays could erupt between you and others, both at work and in your personal life. No matter how diplomatic you may be, people won’t budge. At least they probably won’t get in your face about it. Mercury will be entering the most perceptive part of your chart on Wednesday, at which point you’ll be able to sniff out what’s going on.

"
1174,24 june 2019,virgo,"You can’t fit a square peg in a round hole, Virgo. So don’t even try to get people to do things your way, or to understand your side of things. Friday is a better time for expressing yourself as a Moon-Saturn trine will put everyone in a more open minded place.

"
1175,25 june 2019,virgo,"No matter how much you may think you know someone, do you really? And while we’re on this conversation, just how well do you know yourself?  A probing Chiron aspect urges you to go within to find out. Maybe you need to meditate. Perhaps you should speak with a therapist. Or simply journaling may help. Find a modality that works for you.

"
1176,26 june 2019,virgo,"” I see dead people!” OK, maybe you’re not going to see the spirit world, but now that Mercury is in the most psychic part of your chart you could get some interesting intuitive hits. Pay attention to these between now and July 7th, as they could provide you with wisdom.

"
1177,28 june 2019,virgo,"You have permission to be happy, Virgo. Yes—the cosmos says that it’s perfectly OK to laugh, love and enjoy life.

"
1178,29 june 2019,virgo,"Your attitude should start to lighten up a little bit thanks to the Moon entering the most optimistic part of your chart. Things may not be as bad as you or others are making them out to be. Have a little faith, Virgo!

"
1179,30 june 2019,virgo,"Chilling out and not doing much may sound real good today, but the planets suggest otherwise. Even if you’re just sitting back with a beer in you hand, you should at least be thinking about how you’ll be getting things done this week. Plan your work and work your plan.

"
1180,1 july 2019,virgo,"Your subconscious mind could go into overdrive now that energetic Mars is in the most psychological part of your chart. This can go two ways: a bit tense, as old memories, dramas and fears rise to the surface. Or fabulous, as your intuition increases as does your motivation to be happier. Heal yourself.

"
1181,2 july 2019,virgo,"A busy social season kicks off as Venus is getting ready to enter your house of networking. The only problem is that there may be so many people who want a piece of you that it will be hard to keep them happy! Don’t forget to leave some time for yourself too.

"
1182,3 july 2019,virgo,"New people may come flooding into your life, courtesy of a solar eclipse in the networking part of your chart. Make new friends or join a club. Lend a hand to a volunteer effort. Join a mastermind group or find a mentor who can help you move your career along. Choose wisely, though, as Saturn–planet of long term consequences–is in a tough angle to the eclipse.

"
1183,4 july 2019,virgo,"Saturn, planet of maturity and long term planning, is demanding that you associate only with people who respect   you. But today the ringed planet opposes the North Node, indicating that you may feel some kind of obligation to keep certain people in your life who aren’t the most supportive. Over the next few months you’ll have some decisions to make. Choose happiness.

"
1184,5 july 2019,virgo,"A Moon-Jupiter-Neptune triangle recommends that you change the way you communicate with others, especially loved ones. There is a cathartic vibe going on here, so think of ways that you can get your point across without drama. Holding things in is not advised, and once the Moon moves into Virgo tomorrow, you can let it all out.

"
1185,6 july 2019,virgo,"Yes! The Moon is in your sign, which means that it’s the perfect weekend to indulge in what matters to you. With so much energy in your friendship sector, you should be reaching out to the tribe and making plans. It’s time for an adventure or two, don’t you think?

"
1186,7 july 2019,virgo,"Moody blues? Brainy Mercury begins to retrograde in the most hidden, psychological part of your chart. This could stir up all sorts of old memories and emotions, some of them on the stinky side. But this is necessary. The cosmos, in its wisdom, knows that we need to do a mental cleanse from time to time, and this is an excellent opportunity to heal. Complete this inner work by the 19th, at which time Mercury moves on.

"
1187,8 july 2019,virgo,"Doing things a certain way because “that’s the way we’ve always done things” just isn’t going to work. You need a fresh approach, stat! Fortunately genius Uranus is active in one of the brainiest parts of your chart, helping you think outside of the box. The best part is that others will see the brilliance behind what you come up with.

"
1188,9 july 2019,virgo,"It could become blindingly obvious that you don’t share the same opinions and values as others, and this could cause concern. Just chill out for now and don’t make any key decisions. Thursday and Friday are much better times for figuring it all out.

"

The presence of the Sun indicates that you won’t have to grovel, and Neptune will help you be inspired. Keep opinions out of the picture, and avoid giving advice to someone else. Just make amends.

"
1190,11 july 2019,virgo,"Are things going on behind the scenes? Your Spidey sense may tell you that something is up, but it is NOT wise to confront anyone or start texting away. First of all, you may be wrong. And even if you aren’t, you don’t want the other party to know you’re on to them.

"
1191,12 july 2019,virgo,"There’s nothing wrong with you, Virgo. You are perfect just the way you are. That’s the message from the cosmos, and it’s high time you accepted it! Take good care of yourself this weekend, nurture your soul.

"
1193,14 july 2019,virgo,"Put on your battle helmet and flak jacket. The Sun opposes Pluto, a tough aspect as this will bring out power plays and ego trips. You’ll especially see this within a romantic relationship or among your friends. Either you’re going to be at the receiving end of it, or stuck in the middle somehow. An eclipse is coming on Tuesday, heightening the energy. Keep calm and carry on.

"
1194,15 july 2019,virgo,"Both your head and your heart are hard at work today. Therefore you’ll be able to see both sides of a situation, especially one that involves people who mean a lot to you.

A sizzling lunar eclipse occurs here, which could bring something to a happy conclusion: conceiving a baby, meeting the love of your life, scoring a book deal or getting engaged, for starters. The key is to follow your own heart and keep others’ opinions (no matter how well meant) out of your decision making process.

"
1196,17 july 2019,virgo,"Too many rules in a relationship can spoil spontaneity and a sense of freedom. This is true within a romance, family connections or business alliances. If anyone tries to hem you in today, chances are you’ll rebel. Is it time for a clean break, or do you just need to cool off for 24 hours?

1199,20 july 2019,virgo,"People may not be willing to play nice due to a Venus-Pluto opposition. This is more likely in your personal life than your professional one. There is a childish vibe going on here. It kind of reminds me of my sister, who in the midst of her 5th birthday party took all of her presents, went into her room, locked the door and left her friends to play party games by themselves. Yeah, it’s that kind of day.

"
1200,21 july 2019,virgo,"It’s a great day for connecting with friends and loved ones thanks to a Mercury-Sun conjunction. Mercury is retrograde, so it’s possible that people from your past may reappear on the scene. Or issues that need to be resolved will crop up again. Fortunately the cosmic energy is logical and productive, so do your best to make things work.

"
1201,22 july 2019,virgo,"Sshhh! The Sun enters Leo, the most reflective and sensitive part of your chart. It’s time to rest, recuperate and recharge your batteries. This is also the house of confidential matters, so you could be doing things behind the scenes to improve your situation. It’s especially important to work out housing, romantic and family matters before August 11th.

"
1202,23 july 2019,virgo,"The Sun is now in the most confidential part of your chart and you have some big decisions to make. A Moon-Mars aspect helps you zoom in on the important matters and ignore the trivial ones. If you want to run something past a friend or mentor, tomorrow is an excellent time to do so.

"
1203,24 july 2019,virgo,"There is only so much you can accomplish on your own, Virgo. The Sun and other orbs are in the most secluded part of your chart, so chances are you’re more interested in doing things by yourself. But a wonderful Mercury-Venus aspect today encourages you to bring in others to support you. Even if all you want is advice, get it–and then do your own thing.

"
1204,25 july 2019,virgo,"Drama, begone! You’ll be highly motivated to keep the peace as healing, abundant Jupiter is active in your house of personal contentment. This doesn’t mean letting people walk all over you, or putting up with crummy situations. No, this is about developing wisdom. The kind that enables you to see the big picture: what’s truly important in life and what’s not.

"
1205,26 july 2019,virgo,"Don’t let your emotions get the better of you, Virgo. A strong Mars-Saturn aspect helps you see things for the way they really are. Your intuition is on point too and will only continue to get stronger in the weeks ahead. That’s the benefit of psychic foresight: it helps you calm down and be self assured.

"
1206,27 july 2019,virgo,"Feeling like a sexy, steamy agent provocateur?  You should be! Amorous Venus sashays into the most mysterious part of your chart, the place where fantasy reigns. Lusty Mars and the Sun are there too, making for a sultry month ahead. Get in touch with your erotic side!

"
1207,28 july 2019,virgo,"Old emotional wounds get a nice dose of healing energy from Chiron and the Sun. The next few weeks are some of the best in years to do some inner work, the kind that can bring you peace. It’s worth the effort.

"
1208,29 july 2019,virgo,"Opinionated bloviators may be circling like sharks, so unless you want to have an aggravating day, ignore them. Better yet, steer the Good Ship Virgo out of choppy waters and into calmer seas. Once Mercury goes direct on Wednesday you’ll be able to deal with people without pointing a harpoon at them.

"
1209,30 july 2019,virgo,"You may be strongly tempted to push your own agenda today, but the cosmos warns against it. You need to be a bit more diplomatic in your approach. So go ahead, move forward with what you want to do. Just keep your ego out of it and remember that you need  cooperation from others.

"
1210,31 july 2019,virgo,"Yesss!!! Your social life picks up steam now that Mercury is direct in your house of friends and networking. Misunderstandings will start to disappear, especially in team efforts. But even though you’ll be in the midst of more people, keep certain pieces of information to yourself. This is not the time to be an open book.

"
1211,1 august 2019,virgo,"Stick with your own personal wisdom, Virgo. A cathartic new moon occurs in Leo, helping you release past dramas and feelings that may be holding you back. You know better than anyone what needs to go. Don’t listen to others, no matter how well-meaning they may be. Your sixth sense is solid gold right now.

"
1212,2 august 2019,virgo,"Your sensitivity is heightened due to gentle Venus in the house of feelings and deep thoughts. But people in your world could be overly opinionated, which could set off feelings of discomfort and annoyance. This cosmic storm passes quickly as the Moon glides into Virgo tomorrow. So let it pass.

"
1213,3 august 2019,virgo,"Just do “you” this weekend, Virgo! The Moon is in your sign and it’s time to get in touch with your authentic self. With so many planets in your house of closure and healing, you should be thinking about living differently. This doesn’t necessarily mean moving, changing jobs or revamping your look, although you could do that. This is more of an attitude adjustment, a positive change in your mental state!

"
1214,4 august 2019,virgo,"Sometimes the less skin you show, the sexier you are. And the less you say creates more mystery. It’s time to be an agent provocateur  rather than a walking billboard, showing off your assets. Make them sweat and keep ’em guessing.

"
1215,5 august 2019,virgo,"Show people that you know how to play by the rules, Virgo. Show them that you’re willing to listen to their point of view. You’re so used to doing everything on your own that sometimes you forget that you need the cooperation of others. Be a team player…for now, anyway!

"
1216,6 august 2019,virgo,"Being outspoken may feel like it’s your right. After all, aren’t you allowed to have an opinion? But others may view you as being too pushy. Maybe they’re not used to how fervently you feel, and this is 100% their problem. However, if you have any doubts keep things a bit more subdued.

"
1217,7 august 2019,virgo,"An amazing stroke of luck could come your way over the next few days. Or maybe it’s a piece of news. Either way, it’s something that should put your heart and mind at rest. Family and home related matters are especially well favored, and that includes creating a cozy nest with your lover.

"
1218,8 august 2019,virgo,"Be more open about your feelings, but just with the people who count the most. A cathartic Venus-Jupiter aspect enables you to heal old wounds and feel better about the future. Today is also fabulous for romance. Single? Someone special may be admiring you from the sidelines. Coupled up Virgos should spend a sexy evening at home.

"
1219,9 august 2019,virgo,"You’re in a wonky cosmic place these days. On the one hand, the Sun is in your house of seclusion, telling you to pull away from the crowd and pamper yourself. On the other hand, planets are active in your houses of love, family and friends! What’s a smart Virgo to do? Find a happy balance in which you have enough downtime for yourself and enough for socializing.

"
1220,10 august 2019,virgo,"The blame game is a pointless activity, so don’t go there. And if other people are trying to make you feel guilty for something, let it go without making a big fuss. With the brilliant Sun in the most psychological part of your chart, you  will know what’s truly going on. No need to explain yourself to anyone.

"
1221,11 august 2019,virgo,"Feeling more comfortable in your own skin is a lovely feeling that you can now enjoy! Jupiter just went direct in your domestic sector, which not only deals with home and family, but your inner sense of being “at home”. Logical Mercury zips into the house of the subconscious mind, helping you to get rid of fears and worries. And crazy Uranus retrogrades in the house of adventure, which will get rid of ups and downs that may have been driving you nuts.

"
1222,12 august 2019,virgo,"With so much planetary activity lately in your house of seclusion, you may have forgotten how to have fun. Or maybe there hasn’t been quality time available for romance, hobbies and going out. That changes today thanks to a Mo0n-Saturn connection. Who cares if it’s a Monday? You desperately need to chill out.

"
1223,13 august 2019,virgo,"Sticking to habits or routines could be difficult under today’s murky aspects. It could also be tough to figure out the best way to handle something. Don’t sweat it: this is temporary. Thursday’s full moon shines its powerful light on things, so wait until then if you can.

"
1224,14 august 2019,virgo,"It’s time for some extreme self care, Virgo. With luxe Venus in your house of metamorphic changes, you should do what it takes to feel better about yourself and life in general. Maybe you need a visit to a spa, or a quick weekend out of town. Perhaps it’s some quiet time with a good book or a sexy lover! You know what’s best for you. Just do it.

1225,15 august 2019,virgo,"Your birthday season is almost here, and it’s time to make more room in your life for people you love and enjoying life.

This year’s Virgo season is the most intense I’ve seen in a long time, and in a good way. You want to be rested and ready for it!

"
1226,16 august 2019,virgo,"It’s always fun to daydream, but there has to be a limit to it. A Mercury-Uranus square brings a reality check. Pay attention today to facts and what’s going on in front of you. Red hot Mars will be entering Virgo in 48 hours, at which time you’ll be able to make things happen for real.

"
1227,17 august 2019,virgo,"You don’t have to be friends with everyone, Virgo. At the office you don’t need to be the go-to person either. In love relationships, you don’t have to be the glue that is holding everything together. Quit putting this burden on yourself. Look out for #1 a bit more.

"
1228,18 august 2019,virgo,"OK, birthday season is here! Not officially, of course–the Sun doesn’t show up in your sign til Friday. But red hot Mars enters Virgo today, a place it hasn’t been in two years. Mars will light a big fire under you to change your life path in every way possible. Pay close attention to your intuition as it is spot on right now.

"
1229,19 august 2019,virgo,"There’s nothing wrong with pulling away from the crowd and the noise of life, Virgo. In fact, the planets recommend it! A healing lunar aspect is just the ticket for examining your thoughts and feelings. From your chart it appears that you need to adjust the way you handle things with loved ones especially. Reflect and revise.

"
1230,20 august 2019,virgo,"News could come your way that might unsettle you somewhat. Is there any substance to it? Probably not. You’re in an emotional place due to the Moon squaring the Sun.

1231,21 august 2019,virgo,"Are you ready for prime time? For your big debut? Gorgeous Venus enters Virgo today, making you the person to watch. But don’t be surprised if you’re feeling as though you’re not quite ready. Mercury is still in the most hidden part of your chart, telling you to take things slow.

"
1232,22 august 2019,virgo,"People could be sending mixed signals, courtesy of murky Neptune acting up in your opposite sign. Your best bet is to use your intuition to figure out what’s going on, rather than confronting others with direct questions. This energy reoccurs around the 30th, but by that time the Sun will be in your sign—and you won’t give a hoot about what other people are thinking or saying!

"
1233,23 august 2019,virgo,"Yeah, baby! The Sun is now in Virgo and you are finally the celestial favorite. This birthday season is fabulous for romance, thanks to Mars and Venus also being in your sign.

1234,24 august 2019,virgo,"If I could take your charisma and bottle it I’d be an overnight millionaire, Virgo! Today lusty Mars meets up with glamorous, amorous Venus in your sign. Your magnetism is at an all time high. Don’t worry, this energy won’t be fading anytime soon either. It keeps right on going all the way into mid-September, so go ahead…dazzle everyone.

"
1235,25 august 2019,virgo,"Assertive Mars is in your sign and is hell bent on getting its way. Be careful, though, not to offend others while on your quest. Besides, are you really sure that you want everything just so? Some adventurous aspects starting tomorrow could open your eyes to fresh possibilities that you’ve never considered.

The next four days are awesome  for switching things up, from your clothes, hair and makeup to your attitude. People may be shocked but too bad! You’ll end up enjoying this process so much that you won’t care.

"
1237,27 august 2019,virgo,"Loosen up, Virgo! Don’t expect everyone in your personal life to live by your “rules”. We’re all different people, with different opinions and backgrounds. If you are too judgmental you could lose valuable support.

"
1240,30 august 2019,virgo,"First the good news: the annual new moon in Virgo occurs today, the best time all year for kicking off initiatives that are important to you. By March 2020 you could see results. Now for the less exciting news: not everyone will support your plans. Expect the resistance to be more on the passive-aggressive kind rather than in-your-face. From your chart, though, it appears that you’re not going to care….or slow down!

"
1241,31 august 2019,virgo,"“Patience is a virtue”, my grandmother always said to me, because heaven knows I was one impatient kid. And that’s the message the cosmos has for you today, Virgo: chill out already. It seems that you’re getting fed up with the inability of other people to make a decision or to be clear about something. Getting annoyed won’t help matters, but giving things time will.

"
1242,1 september 2019,virgo,"You are a force to be reckoned with, something that people are going to figure out over the next two weeks. With spunky Uranus activating the most daring part of your chart, you’ll be ready to undertake new challenges without batting an eyelash. Travel and romance are especially well aspected right now. Surprise everyone with your own personal “shock and awe” campaign.

"
1243,2 september 2019,virgo,"I have to hand it to you–you are turning into a phenom. With the Sun, Mars and Venus all ramping up your charm and motivation, the realization is hitting you that you’ve got this. Bravo! However, try telling this to people on the sidelines (aka trolls) who just want to tear you down. Avoid the losers and stick with the people on Team Virgo–even if you’re the only one on the team!

"
1244,3 september 2019,virgo,"“Get outta my way!”  Geez, Virgo, you are beyond motivated these days. But you’re entitled to feel like this. Mercury, Mars and the Sun are all pushing you to look out for your own interests and plans. This isn’t selfish, it’s smart. This is truly the most intense Virgo season in years, and it’s time for you to switch things up in a major manner.

"
1245,4 september 2019,virgo,"With so much planetary activity going on in your sign, you are primarily thinking about your own needs. Which is fine, by the way. But no man or woman is an island and you need to consider what others are thinking. The problem is that they may not know themselves why they want! So don’t even try to figure them out today. They’ll need to process their thoughts in their own sweet time.

"
1246,5 september 2019,virgo,"The time has come to stop planning and to start doing. With so much positive planetary activity going on in the most creative part of your chart, your ability to produce something amazing is up there. Take this energy and run with it, as it will last all month long. (But that doesn’t give you license to procrastinate!)

"
1247,6 september 2019,virgo,"Tiny houses, midcentury modern design, Japanese temples and gardens–what do all of these have in common? Simplicity. Curation. Deliberate choices to only have certain objects present. We can do this with other choices too: our careers, friends, “time off” activities and so on. Right now, Virgo, you’re facing a plethora of options. Start curating and simplify your life.

"

"
1250,3 january 2019,libra,"Teamwork could be in short supply today. Colleagues, friends or family members could slack off big-time. Maybe they think it’s your job to do all the heavy lifting. It’s not, and they may need to be set straight.

"
1251,4 january 2019,libra,"Domestic matters are picking up steam as a plethora pf planets activates this part of your chart.

Fortunately smooth talking Mercury glides into this part of your chart today.

"
1252,5 january 2019,libra,"If anyone thinks that you’re the maid…..or the go-to person who needs to do things when others slack off….is dead wrong! But you’d better let them know that, otherwise you are stuck on that hamster wheel. Today magnetic Venus will enable you to (sweetly) let others know that playing Cinderella ain’t your thang.

"
1253,6 january 2019,libra,"There is going to be a lot of action surrounding your home and family over the next few months. A solar eclipse occurs in your house of home and relatives, indicating that a fresh start is beginning. This could play out in so many ways: you could move to another state. Buy a house.

"
1258,11 january 2019,libra,"Family matters need to be settled, for once and for all. A cluster of planets in your domestic sector demands it!

"
1259,12 january 2019,libra,"Over the next few days you’ll need to think about what other people need and not just be focused on yourself. But that’s OK; the more tenderness and attention you give to others, the more it will come back to you.

"
1260,13 january 2019,libra,"Inner security is becoming more important to you, as is being less stressed. From your chart it appears that you’ve been trying to do too much in too little time. Start cutting back on some of your activities. Less is more.

"

"
1262,15 january 2019,libra,"It’s critical to create strong bonds with family and loved ones. You are in excellent position to do so, thanks to mature Saturn in your house of family and serenity.

"
1263,16 january 2019,libra,"Residential and family matters could be under review, and in a big way, too. The dynamics between family members may need to be adjusted. Perhaps you’re thinking about moving cross country. Is a lover suggesting that you move in? Hmmmm. Decisions will have to be made.

1291,1 march 2019,libra,"
Woo-hoo! Amorous Venus enters your frisky house of love today, a place it will remain for almost a month. But keep things light, my friend. If you push too hard for a ring, baby, cohabitation or other kind of commitment, things could fall apart.

"
1292,10 march 2019,libra,"
Over the next week there will be a lot of demands on your time and energy. Make sure that others are doing their fair share. Otherwise you’re going to burn out. That said, you may actually enjoy the hectic pace, as you know that you’re getting somewhere….fast.

"
1293,11 march 2019,libra,"
If certain people in your life need to recognize boundaries, this is a good day to spell that out. Fortunately you won’t have to scream and yell. Just lay it on the line. 

"
1294,12 march 2019,libra,"
Get rid of the rose colored glasses and take good look at what people are saying and doing. Optimistic Jupiter could make people way too confident about what they can do. By the way, make sure that you don’t fall under this category. While it’s a great day for brainstorming and coming up with creative ideas, someone is going to have to be the voice of reason and logic.

"
1295,13 march 2019,libra,"
We’ve all heard the phrase, “You need to get your house in order.” Naturally this can literally mean your home, and sometimes it refers to your finances. But today the planets are concerned about your body, mind and spirit. It’s time to treat them like a sacred temple that can’t be violated.

"
1296,14 march 2019,libra,"
Make your expectations clear to other people, Libra. With so much planetary action in your efficiency sector, you’ve got places to go and people to meet. You can’t let anyone hold you back. 

"
1297,15 march 2019,libra,"
Trying to talk sense to people these days is completely useless, Libra. People may not want to hear the truth, even if it is delivered by someone who is as diplomatic as you are. Let them figure it out for themselves.

"
1298,16 march 2019,libra,"
With the Sun and Mercury in your house of well-being, it’s time to take much better care of your health. The best place to start is at home. Clean out the junk food from the refrigerator and cabinets. Dedicate a spot for a  workout routine, such as yoga. Expensive gems aren’t necessary; dedication is.

"
1299,17 march 2019,libra,"
Some things just aren’t worth getting upset about, Libra. Now that Mercury is retrograding through one of the most practical parts of your chart, you may realize this. Changing your attitude isn’t something that necessarily takes months. It can be done in a matter of seconds.

"
1300,18 march 2019,libra,"
With the Moon in the most giving part of your chart, you may decide to donate your time and energy to a worthy cause. Not only will the world benefit from your help, but you could also meet some interesting new people who share your passion.

"
1301,19 march 2019,libra,"
A full moon is arriving in your sign on Thursday. Since full moons bring things to a close, you’d be smart to wrap up any family or housing issues today. This could be anything from finding a new place to live, to settling a family or romantic argument. Cooperation counts.

"
1302,20 march 2019,libra,"
Ready to fall in love with a new flame, or to deepen your bond with your lover? Then you’re in luck. The Sun glides into your partnership sector today. It just so happens that lusty Mars is in the house of sex (good timing, no?) so the next few weeks could be delicious.

"
1303,21 march 2019,libra,"
There’s a full moon in the night sky and it has your name written all over it! Yup, it’s the annual full moon in Libra, which puts your needs and plans front and center. A Mars-Venus square could make you feel a bit edgy and dramatic, but watch out for becoming a diva.

"
1304,22 march 2019,libra,"
Do you feel as though you’re nothing if you’re not in a relationship with someone? Or are you letting a lover push you around? You are your own person, Libra. There’s nothing wrong with being alone or protective of your self esteem. Draw some healthy boundaries.

"
1305,23 march 2019,libra,"
Some kind of reality check could come your way today, and it could throw you off balance. But this isn’t a bad thing: the cosmos is trying to point out areas where you’re not being practical. The smoke will clear as next week progresses.

"
1306,24 march 2019,libra,"
Motivation strikes! Don’t be surprised if you suddenly want to tackle something that you’ve been avoiding. Mercury and Neptune meet up in your house of efficiency, telling you to just do it, already.

"
1307,25 march 2019,libra,"If you need to persuade someone to do things your way, now is a good time! A stellar Moon-Sun aspect gives you the gift of gab. As long as you’re willing to be diplomatic about things and do a little compromising, it’s all systems “go”.

"
1308,26 march 2019,libra,"If you need to persuade someone to do things your way, now is a good time! A stellar Moon-Sun aspect gives you the gift of gab. As long as you’re willing to be diplomatic about things and do a little compromising, it’s all systems “go”.

"
1309,27 march 2019,libra,"It’s time to take better care of your health, Libra. Not just the physical kind, but the emotional too. As a matter of fact you could experience an “aha!” moment today in which you realize where you may be sabotaging both. Welcome this, as it will help you move past it.

"
1310,31 march 2019,libra,"There’s a saying: life begins at the end of your comfort zone. Keep that in mind over the next two months, because aggressive Mars is now in your house of taking chances. It hasn’t been here since 2017. As a result, if there’ve been things that you’ve been putting off–interesting things that you want to do–stop waiting for a “better time”. It’s here.

"
1311,7 april 2019,libra,"Chances are you’ve been pushing hard lately due to planetary activity in your house of productivity. Today is a smart time to get things in order at home, as disciplined Saturn is active in your domestic sector. But for heaven’s sakes don’t spend the whole day cleaning out the garage. Planets in your sports sector are also calling your name.

"
1312,8 april 2019,libra,"Feeling resentful lately? Maybe it’s because you have so many planets in your house of efficiency, and you may feel as though you’re the only one doing anything. If that’s the case you may need to set some boundaries. Will other people listen? Probably not. Stop doing as much and let them start picking up the slack.

"
1313,9 april 2019,libra,"Someone close may be going through a hard time, and you may need to help them out. This is more on an emotional level than a financial one. You are in a very practical place thanks to logical Mercury by your side. Will they listen? perhaps. At least you tried to assist them.

"
1314,10 april 2019,libra,"How do you present yourself to the world? That’s the question posed by abundant Jupiter as it begins to retrograde in the heavens. How you speak, think and write are all part of this “renewal project”. Things could slow down, like writing your thesis, negotiating contracts or social media campaigns. But practice makes perfect, so keep hammering away.

"
1315,11 april 2019,libra,"You could be incredibly inspired to live a healthier, fitter, more vibrant life. Planets are active in your house of wellness. It’s time to throw away the excuses and do the best thing for your body. By the way, this doesn’t involve an expensive gym membership. Home based exercise programs are well aspected right now.

"
1316,12 april 2019,libra,"People could being nitpicky today, which is annoying because you’re in an optimistic mood. They may find fault in everything that you say and do. Who cares! You actually have your sh** together, so there’re no position to point fingers at you.

"
1317,13 april 2019,libra,"You may feel as though you can’t keep anyone happy today, but this is a short-lived experience. Cosmic energy improves tomorrow, so wait until then. In the meantime, do your own thing and have a blast in the process!

"
1318,14 april 2019,libra,"You may need to talk some sense into people today, and amazingly it just may work! You have diplomacy and practicality working for you, so don’t hold back. Even if it takes others a few days to realize that you’re right, so be it.

"
1319,15 april 2019,libra,"Become as focused as a laser beam, Libra. Other people may try to pull you off track with their petty nonsense and dramas. But you have things to do, and if you get sucked in, you’ll never finish. Besides, negativity spreads like a cancer. Keep it away from you.

"
1320,16 april 2019,libra,"Dealing with aches and pains that don’t seem to go away? Or perhaps you know that it’s time to get on a diet and exercise plan. Old habits die hard, and this could be why your body is in the shape that it’s in. A Moon-Neptune opposition could make you painfully aware of this. Here’s some good news though: Friday’s full moon is in your sign, boosting your determination to change.

"
1321,17 april 2019,libra,"The full moon is arriving in your sign on Friday, and you have a lot of big decisions to make. You might want to start with romantic relationships, considering that logical Mercury enters that part of your chart today. Think long and hard about the kind of relationship you want to be in. Do you have that now? If not, something needs to change.

"
1322,18 april 2019,libra,"A Moon-Pluto square indicates that people could be working your nerves. If anyone is using guilt or passive-aggressive tactics with you, chances are you’ll flip out. Try to keep calm and carry on, as tomorrow’s full moon is in Libra…..and it’s all about you.

"
1323,19 april 2019,libra,"Yes! A glistening full moon occurs in your sign, shining its light on what you  desire. Tomorrow the Sun enters your house of sex, intimacy and net worth, so yeah….this is a damn good place to start!

"
1324,20 april 2019,libra,"Romance gets a huge  boost from two planetary orbs changing signs today! First the fiery Sun glides into Taurus, your house of sex and forming deep emotional bonds. Then amorous Venus enters your house of commitment. So the next few weeks could be mighty intense. Singles, you aren’t left out of this conversation: your opportunities for meeeting someone new are going to increase.

"
1325,21 april 2019,libra,"It’s a good time to socialize and let off some steam. With so many planets in emotional parts of your chart, you need to just have some fun without people pushing your buttons. Only associate with people who are as interested in having fun as you are….no drama allowed!

"
1326,22 april 2019,libra,"Try to keep your emotions in check, Libra. Unpredictable Uranus is kicking up a fuss, and you could be a lot more independent than usual. There’s nothing wrong with being independent, as long as you don’t tell everyone to go f*** off. This is also a wonderful time for feeling better about yourself. Keep calm and shine on.

"
1327,23 april 2019,libra,"You’ve got the gift of gab today, so work it. Lucky Jupiter is in your house of communication, putting the right words in your mouth. Needless to say, this energy is wonderful for negotiating and strategizing. But it’s also perfect for flirting and letting someone know how much you love them.

"
1328,24 april 2019,libra,"If you have been dealing with any family or housing matters, they can no longer be pushed to the back burner. Pluto begins to retrograde today in your domestic sector, followed by Saturn next week. The next few months are auspicious for setting boundaries with people who may be pushing it. You could also come to a happy agreement with a lover about living arrangements, getting married or having a baby.

"
1329,25 april 2019,libra,"Lay down the law with people who’ve been butting in to your affairs, or criticizing you. You don’t need their input. Unfortunately, they haven’t figured that out yet. Do this now or you’ll lose your cool this coming weekend.

"
1330,26 april 2019,libra,"Dot your i’s and cross your t’s: the nitpickers are out there today, and your boss could be one of them. So could a major client or some other authority figure. This is not a good day to call out sick, show up late or do sloppy work. Keep it professional.

"
1331,27 april 2019,libra,"Facts and details may be hard to come by, and people could be talking in circles. This won’t sit well with you, because with Mars in the most visionary part of your chart, you can see the big picture. It’s going to take other people awhile to come around, so you’ll need to be patient.

"
1332,28 april 2019,libra,"Matters at home definitely need tending. This includes your relationships with family members, even if they live elsewhere. But this doesn’t mean that you must play the role of peace maker. Nor do you have to clean up someone else’s mess.

"
1333,29 april 2019,libra,"Family members may need you a lot more over the next few months, Libra. Housing matters may also take center stage. That’s because Saturn goes retrograde today in your domestic sector, joining Pluto. Take care of things now so that you can rest easy for the remainder of 2019.

"
1334,30 april 2019,libra,"You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make them drink. Remind yourself of this fact, Libra, as people may be resistant to common sense. Sometimes you just have to let them figure things out for themselves.

"
1335,1 may 2019,libra,"From your chart it appears that you should be hanging out with people who know how to enjoy life to the max, Libra. If you’re already associated with people like this, then it’s time to plan an outrageous adventure. Otherwise you should make some new friends whose mantra is “Carpe diem”!

"
1336,2 may 2019,libra,"People could be sticklers, demanding that things be done a certain way. Their  way of doing things may be completely irrational, but they won’t want to hear that. Trying to talk sense to them won’t work, not today. Tomorrow is a much different story.

"
1337,3 may 2019,libra,"You could find yourself in the right place, at the right time and with just the right words! A terrific Mercury-Jupiter aspect helps you shine. New people could come your way who could change your life for the better. But none of this will happen if you’re sitting at home, so get out already.

"
1338,4 may 2019,libra,"A new Moon occurs in one of the most interesting parts of your chart, the eighth house of sex and net worth. It opens up a brand new chapter during which your love life can become more intimate, with a deeper emotional connection to boot. Building a stronger financial foundation is also possible. However, don’t count your chickens before they hatch. Give things time to gel.

"
1339,5 may 2019,libra,"Being optimistic is generally considered to be a positive trait. However, a Jupiter-Mars opposition warns against being overly confident about where things are going. This could be in your career, love life, schooling or anything else. Slow down, be logical and observe what’s going on.

"
1340,6 may 2019,libra,"Your emotional state should start to level off, thanks to a bevy of helpful planets all operating in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. Today logical Mercury enters this zone, adding even more rational thought to your life. Life doesn’t need to be a rollercoaster, Libra.

"
1341,7 may 2019,libra,"Old mental programming from your childhood could come back today, along with the usual guilt and feelings of not being worthy. It’s a bunch of BS, babe, so let it go! Tomorrow is one of the most cathartic days of the year. Find a way to release this stuff. Bon voyage.

"
1342,8 may 2019,libra,"Something surprising but good could happen today, Libra. Mercury and Uranus are active in your house of love, sex and net worth. That is one loaded ticket! An emotional breakthrough could be yours. Singles could meet the level of their lives. An amazing investment opportunity could come your way, or an idea for a business. This energy continues into tomorrow, so keep your radar turned on.

"
1343,9 may 2019,libra,"With happy Jupiter active in your self expression sector, the lines of communication are wide open. You should be able to have a conversation with just about anyone, except  for maybe family members. They could be a bit bossy. Otherwise, it’s a great day for socializing, flirting, cutting business deals and promoting yourself.

"
1344,10 may 2019,libra,"No matter what you do or say, people may not be satisfied, which is irksome. With gentle Venus in the most diplomatic part of your chart you will be willing to work with people. But are they ready to do the same? If not, wait until tomorrow when the cosmic skies are clearer.

"
1345,11 may 2019,libra,"This is a smart time to get your finances in order, especially when it comes to investments. Retirement accounts, real estate, mutual funds, child support: you should pull out your statements and get a clear idea of where you stand. Right now is an awesome time to develop your net worth. If you don’t have any money set aside, start making small deposits and stick with it.

"
1346,12 may 2019,libra,"You may be privy to some secrets, and if that’s the case, keep things confidential. A friend or colleague may confide in you. It’s also possible that some news is “on the wind”, something that can help you. Keep your radar turned on and pay attention to what others are saying.

"
1347,13 may 2019,libra,"What do YOU need, Libra? Your sign is well known for being diplomatic and caring, but now it’s time to take care of #1. With probing Pluto active in the house of inner peace, you really need to ask yourself what would bring you the most comfort. The good news is that the rest of the week is well aspected for doing this kind of important inner work.

"
1348,14 may 2019,libra,"What big chances would you like to take over the next few years? That’s the question Mars asks as it gets ready to leave your house of adventure and thinking outside the box. Where is it going next? To your house of ambition and making things happen! Finish that bucket list today.

"
1349,15 may 2019,libra,"Love and money are the two biggies that everyone wants, and lucky Libras can have both! That’s because Venus–planet of romance and  profits–enters your house of net worth and deep emotional bonding. It’s a match made in the heavens. Oh, and did I mention that Mars enters your goals sector too? Yes, it does, and nothing is going to stop you.

"
1350,16 may 2019,libra,"Keep calm and carry on. You see that saying on coffee mugs and T-shirt and posters. Now it’s your mantra too, thanks to a chill Mercury-Saturn meet up. Keeping your thoughts and emotions under control will be a theme over the next three weeks, so get used to it. Serenity is the fabulous end result.

"
1351,17 may 2019,libra,"Hmmm, it may be time to reconsider what you say and how you say it. Chatty Mercury is in a flexible spot these days so you may be thinking about using a different tactic with people. This is a smart plan, as you have the opportunity ahead of you to appear on a bigger stage.

"
1352,18 may 2019,libra,"Terrific full moon in Scorpio could bring more cash your way. This could be earned (as in scoring a raise or higher paying new job), or via investments. Real estate matters are especially favored, so if you’re trying to come up with a down payment or get approved for a mortgage, things could go your way.

"
1353,19 may 2019,libra,"The need to have more money in the bank could be pressing on you, Libra. Fortunately you’re in a good position to start earning and saving more. It may require some inventive thinking, but over the next few weeks ideas will come your way.

"
1354,20 may 2019,libra,"There’s a big difference between being optimistic and having your head so far up your rear end that you can’t see the light of day. Make sure that you’re not wearing rose colored glasses, Libra. And if you’re dealing with people who are, then you need to carefully weigh what they’re saying.

"
1355,21 may 2019,libra,"“Danger is my middle name”. That’s the new Libra mantra as the fiery Sun and spritely Mercury zip into your house of adventure and living la vida loca. Let everyone else play by the rules. It’s time for you to shake things up! Lest you worry that you’ll do something stupid, know that the recent full moon occurred in the most stable part of your chart.

"
1356,22 may 2019,libra,"There’s nothing like a sky high net worth to put a smile on someone’s face, right? Then you’ll be pleased to know that the cosmos is helping you to create greater cash flow, the kind that builds wealth. Pay attention to any money making ideas you have over the next 48 hours. They could be winners.

"
1357,23 may 2019,libra,"People may not be willing to cooperate today, and it could get mighty frustrating. It’s not your job to get everyone to agree and play nice either. But don’t make the mistake of steamrolling over everyone, pushing your agenda. By the time the weekend rolls around people will be in a much more agreeable place.

"
1358,24 may 2019,libra,"Yikes. This could be one emotional day, courtesy of a Moon-Venus square. You’re going to have to make a concerted effort to not respond to every provocation. The moon is in the most dramatic part of your chart, so you run the risk of flying off the handle. Take a deep breath and count to ten.

"
1359,25 may 2019,libra,"Your personal magnetism is high, so work it! Seriously, this is a good time to charm others, ask for what you want or make a splash in the business world. You’re starting to realize that you can achieve so much more than you previously thought, and this is a good thing.

"
1360,26 may 2019,libra,"The Sun is in the most adventurous part of your chart, which is a good thing… it’s trying to push you forward. But sometimes you need the cooperation and the blessing of other people in order to get from point a to point B. A positive solar aspect today helps you win them over.

"
1361,27 may 2019,libra,"If your current job or occupation is not fulfilling, then it’s time for a change. In astrology, the North Node of the Moon points out what you should be doing in this lifetime. It is activated today by inspirational Neptune. This is one of the best times in 2019 to change your career path.

"
1362,28 may 2019,libra,"Optimism will take you only so far, Libra. At some point you have to get down to the nitty-gritty details and facts. Right now would be a good time, according to your chart! As the week progresses, other people may try to pull you into their hare brained schemes. Avoid them and stick to what you have in front of you.

"
1363,29 may 2019,libra,"Here’s the good news: you are in an amazingly visionary state right now. Now for the “meh” news: you’re overlooking key details or processes. Or maybe the people around you are slacking, confused or unwilling to do something constructive. Wait until tomorrow, a much better day to gain clarity and to inspire the troops.

"
1364,30 may 2019,libra,"Yikes. A Mercury-Jupiter smackdown could bring out the braggarts, bloviators and egomaniacs. It could also make relatively sane people make statements that they can’t follow through on. They’re not trying to be deceptive; they’re confused and maybe way too optimistic. Ley your own wisdom guide you today, not someone else’s.

"
1365,31 may 2019,libra,"Confidence is sexy. And a healthy, glowing body is too. It doesn’t matter what the scale says; as long as you feel vibrant and you’re putting good things into your body you’ll have personal magnetism oozing out of every pore. A terrific Neptune-Venus trine helps you to create solid health habits and stick with them.

"
1366,1 june 2019,libra,"“If you want someone’s attention, whisper.” That was an advertising slogan for a perfume back in the 80s called “Nuance”. I think you get the idea: you’ll make more progress by being gentle and laid back rather than bashing someone over the head with your message. And a luscious Venus-Jupiter says the same.

"
1367,2 june 2019,libra,"Spirituality may be calling your name, Libra. A positive Venus aspect recommends delving into “alternative” methods when it comes to finding inner peace. You are more determined than ever to feel calm and in control of your life. Consider meditation, psychic development, shamanism or Eastern philosophies as a way to feel stronger and content.

"
1368,3 june 2019,libra,"Famed architect Mies van der Rohe said, “God dwells in the details.” He was referring to paying attention to every little detail when designing a magnificent building. But this is good advice for your life right now, Libra. The new moon occurs in the most optimistic, free styling sector of your chart. You will be tempted to take on challenges that you would never considered before. However, you need a good blueprint, just as an architect does.

"
1369,4 june 2019,libra,"You are firing on all cylinders, Libra! Yesterdays new moon was in your house of adventure and breaking away from the past. And today logical Mercury enters your house of goals and achievement. You are now in an awesome position for making things happen. By the end of 2019, your life could look radically different than the way it does now.

"
1370,6 june 2019,libra,"Your emotions will start to even out thanks to calm Venus in action in your house of psychological depth. From your chart it appears that you need to take more ownership over what’s going on in your life. Otherwise you’re going to be tossed around by every wonky thing that happens in your environment.

"
1371,7 june 2019,libra,"A career or investment option could come your way, and it might be a winner. Success won’t happen overnight but if you’re willing to put in the time it could pay off nicely. Profits planet Venus enters your house of entrepreneurship tomorrow, so you should consider your own startup.

"
1372,11 june 2019,libra,"You’re right on track with your ideas. The problem is that people around you are not! They may try to sway you over to their way of thinking, but this is a mistake. They haven’t thought things through. Stick to your guns, especially through the full moon on the 21st. 

"
1373,12 june 2019,libra,"You may think that your life is following a particular path, but there are some interesting (and good) surprises ahead! Sometimes all it takes is removing the blinders from our eyes. Between now and July 1st you could witness some revolutionary changes.

"
1374,13 june 2019,libra,"Our family history drills so much into our brains that we often don’t realize how pre-programmed we have become. A wonderful Sun-Pluto aspect is just the ticket for identifying and releasing some old childhood baggage. Once it’s gone, don’t look back.

"
1375,14 june 2019,libra,"It’s always a good thing when you can play by the rules….but break them just a bit at the same time! And that’s exactly what you’ll be able to do today. Don’t be afraid to show others that you have talent and desires and dreams. Your optimistic attitude will be infectious. People need some inspiration.

"
1376,15 june 2019,libra,"Are you in the right line of work? That’s the question asked by the cosmos today and over the next few weeks. Maybe you love your field but not the company you work for. Or perhaps you want to start your own business. Consider your options, because the solar eclipse arriving on July 3rd is the best time all year to make changes.

"
1377,16 june 2019,libra,"Stick to what is most important to you this week, and don’t get thrown off track. A solid Mercury-Neptune aspect will enable you to do just that today, but it could be harder on Wednesday. Be as focused as a laser beam.

"
1378,17 june 2019,libra,"Express yourself! The full moon occurs in your house of thinking, writing and speaking. A project that you’ve been working on could come to a successful close. This sector also deals with partying (yay!) and short distance travel, so make some fun plans. Singles, you could meet a new flame close to home.

"
1379,18 june 2019,libra,"You’ve been working hard and people are impressed. Offers could come your way, but are they what you really want? Don’t rush to make a decision. The Cancer time period is your best time all year to score big and it begins on Friday.

"
1380,19 june 2019,libra,"Someone could hand you grief about how you’re spending your time and energy. They may also be peeved about your life choices. Who cares? You’re entitled to do things your way. If they have any doubt about that, then wait until they see what happens after the Sun enters your house of ambition on Friday.

"
1381,20 june 2019,libra,"With unpredictable Uranus in an emotional part of your chart, the smallest thing could set you off today. Keep jealousy and anger and resentment at bay, if you can. The mighty Sun rolls into the most authoritative part of your chart tomorrow. Once that happens you’ll be feeling more confident.

"
1382,21 june 2019,libra,"First the good news: the mighty Sun enters your house of ambition and success! This always happens this time of year, but 2019 brings some interesting twists. There will be a solar eclipse in this sector on July 3rd, which could bring about some exciting new changes that you may not even be aware of right now. But  Neptune starts to retrograde in your house of habits and efficiency. Do you have your act together? Are you truly organized enough to take advantage of new opportunities?

"
1383,22 june 2019,libra,"Time to go on a diet and exercise program? With the Moon in the fitness sector this is a smart thing to consider. Even if your body is perfectly toned, you may still need to get more sleep and eat nutritious goods. Now that the Sun is in the most ambitious part of your chart, you need all the energy you can muster.

"
1384,24 june 2019,libra,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Libra, and there are only so many things you can accomplish. Be wary of taking on too much. You may think you’re an unstoppable force but eventually you’ll burn out.

"
1385,25 june 2019,libra,"Your relationships with other people are a big focus this week. Chiron, the wounded healer, is active. If you’re simmering with resentment, or there is some kind of unfinished business, you need to get it out in the open. Once Mercury enters your house of friendly cooperation tomorrow, the path will become much easier.

"
1386,26 june 2019,libra,"Group activities, parties, hanging out with friends: all of these develop momentum now that Mercury is in your house of networking. Anything with a due date (such as planning a family reunion or finishing a big work project) should be completed before July 7th, at which point Mercury goes retrograde.

"
1387,28 june 2019,libra,"From your chart it appears that you need to vent. Emotional pressure is building up and you need to release it. A cathartic Moon-Saturn aspect allows you to do this maturely, with positive long term benefits.

"
1388,29 june 2019,libra,"Can we all agree to disagree? People may be more willing than usual to see the viewpoint of others. It’s not the end of the world if everyone isn’t on the same page. What matters is that you respect each other’s viewpoints.

"
1389,30 june 2019,libra,"Talk is cheap, so pay attention if someone is trying to get you to do things their way. Either they’re working with an agenda, or they are completely clueless about what they’re saying. Let your own wisdom guide you.

"
1390,1 july 2019,libra,"You’re known by the company you keep, Libra. Mars enters your house of friends and networking for the first time since 2017, casting its light on your connections. Mercury is here too and is scheduled to go retrograde on the 7th. New friends and colleagues will enter your life, people from the past will return, and you’ll be able to tighten your circle.

"
1391,2 july 2019,libra,"A solar eclipse arrives tomorrow in the most ambitious part of your chart. The question is: what (or whom!) should you pursue? Some dreams may not be worth the price you’ll have to pay to achieve them. Consider this carefully.

"
1392,3 july 2019,libra,"A powerful solar eclipse takes place in your house of ambition and success, lighting a fire under you to go after the items on your bucket list. Between now and the end of the year you’ll be able to move mountains. However, you must maintain some kind of balance between your personal life and your drive to accomplish. Otherwise you’ll lose loved ones and burn out….not a happy prospect!

"
1393,4 july 2019,libra,"You don’t need anyone’s approval to do things your way, Libra. Remember that, as a Saturn-North Node opposition could bring out people who want to lay a guilt trip on you. Yesterday’s solar eclipse shone its magnificent light on your big plans. You won’t go anywhere if you’re being held hostage by others’ agendas.

"
1394,5 july 2019,libra,"It’s a great day for rallying the troops to get things done. Maybe the “troops” are your kids, who need to clean up their bedrooms. Or they’re co-workers who need to get on board with a particular project. Or it’s friends and family members who are planning a wedding or reunion. You can inspire them, so lead the charge.

"
1395,6 july 2019,libra,"The weekend has a secluded vibe as the Moon enters Virgo. Chances are you’ll want to pull away from the madding crowd and take good care of yourself. This could mean staying at home and binge watching Netflix, or just taking a nap. Maybe you should book a massage at a day spa. Do whatever it takes to recharge your batteries.

"
1396,7 july 2019,libra,"Who can you count on the most in this crazy world? That’s the question asked by Mercury as it begins to retrograde in your house of friends and networking. If anyone is bringing too much drama into your life, or they’re too self centered, it’s time for a change. Between now and the 19th you’ll be able to suss what’s going on.

"
1397,8 july 2019,libra,"Money could come your way in a most unexpected manner, so keep an eye out for opportunities! This isn’t so much about winning the lottery as it is about coming up with an idea for making passive income. You’re also in a good spot for landing a better job and earning more, so either way you come out ahead.

"
1398,9 july 2019,libra,"A battle may be raging between your personal life and your professional one. Maybe the boss is asking too much of you. Or perhaps you’ve been pushing yourself too hard. This theme is going to come up several more times between now and the 17th, so give it thought. A lunar eclipse on the 16th will be decision time.

"
1399,10 july 2019,libra,"Everyone loves a winner and that’s how you’re going to look—like someone who’s got what it takes! Challenges won’t be a problem for you and people will take note of your can-do attitude. A tip from the cosmos: going it alone right now is better than teaming up.

"
1400,11 july 2019,libra,"Mars and Uranus, the two most stubborn planets in the solar system, are at odds. People could be touchy, or worse–argumentative, jealous or unpredictable. This could throw off either your efforts or those of a group. Tomorrow is a better day to get everyone back on track.

"
1401,12 july 2019,libra,"Whether you know it or not, a lot of people are looking up to you as a role model. This means that you can influence their lives for the better, something that they will treasure. Be open to mentoring someone who needs guidance.

"
1402,13 july 2019,libra,"You’ve got the gift of gab, so work it, honey! A lucky Jupiter-Moon aspect helps to put just the right words in your mouth. The same goes for the written word.  Whether you’re talking to a loved one or promoting the living daylights out of yourself, progress can be made.

"
1403,14 july 2019,libra,"You’ve got places to go and people to meet. You have a life that needs to be led to the fullest. So why are people trying to get in your way? Uh, blame it on pigheaded Pluto, which is opposing the Sun. Don’t be surprised if others use passive-aggressive tactics to get their way. A lunar eclipse is coming on Tuesday, at which time you may just say “enough is enough.”

"
1404,15 july 2019,libra,"Some serious decisions need to be made regarding a residential, family or romantic issue. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse is bringing things to a head, and you’ll feel it today. Tough guys Pluto and Saturn are in no mood for nonsense. Thing long term and protect your own interests. This isn’t selfish; it’s smart.

"
1405,16 july 2019,libra,"Maintaining a balance between your personal and professional lives is a big story in July, thanks to two eclipses in these parts of your chart. One eclipse occurred on the 3rd and another takes place today. Seems like you’ve got some big decisions to make, and this could include having a baby, moving in with a lover or moving to a new place. With mature, long term Saturn nearby, you need to think things through carefully.

"
1406,17 july 2019,libra,"Old memories from your childhood could come racing back as you attempt to do something. Let’s face it, we all have some negative programming from back in the day. The question is: are you going to let it cripple you? Figure out why this blockage is happening, then do what’s necessary to remove it.

"
1407,18 july 2019,libra,"Charm will get you much further than the use of force, Libra! So take a break from ultimatums and scorched earth tactics. As a matter of fact, do the opposite—be soft spoken, maybe even a little mysterious. This will work in love as well as business, so sweeten your words and get to work!

"
1408,19 july 2019,libra,"Career matters and other big goals go under review as Mercury retrogrades back into this part of your chart. This is not the disaster you might expect; it could be enormously helpful. Things that lost momentum (or died) could actually get resuscitated and start to move forward. Between now and the 31st is a smart time to rethink the path ahead for the remainder of 2019.

"
1409,20 july 2019,libra,"The Sun is spending two last days in your house of ambition and success, telling you to focus on what’s most important to you. A Pluto-Venus opposition, though, could bring out resistance from other people, who want you to do things their way. It may be time to set some boundaries and let them know that (a) you have your own life and (b) you intend to run it your way.

"
1410,21 july 2019,libra,"This is the Sun’s last day in your house of career and other important life goals, so hustle while you can! That said, Wednesday is productive as there are still celestial orbs in this sector, helping you out. Today the Sun lines up perfectly with brainy Mercury, making now a good time to negotiate, make presentations or come to a decision about your next step.

"
1411,22 july 2019,libra,"Work that contact list, Libra. And call all your friends to schedule some epic parties and adventures. The Sun is now in Leo, your eleventh house of hanging out with BFFs, team members, mentors and clubs. The people you know could be unusually lucky for you over the next month. Work in a tech-heavy career? Then you’ll benefit as the eleventh house governs the digital world.

"
1412,23 july 2019,libra,"There’s a nice air of cooperation going on thanks to a Moon-Mars trine. If you’ve been thinking about joining a team, making new friends or finding The One, this is an auspicious time to do so. Over the next four weeks you should make every effort to meet new people and reconnect with folks from your past.

"
1413,24 july 2019,libra,"Finding work that you truly enjoy is in the stars, Libra. A wonderful Venus-Mercury meet up is just the ticket for focusing on doing something that makes you heart sing. The good news is that Mercury is logical and strategic, whereas Venus governs profits….and makes things easier than expected!

"
1414,25 july 2019,libra,"From your chart one thing is really obvious: you need to be involved in lots of social activities! Lucky Jupiter could bring in new faces, people who could become BFFs, lovers, colleagues or team members. Long term Saturn is well aspected too, indicating that some of these folks could be around for the long haul. It’s also an excellent time to reconnect with people you already know. Right now the more, the merrier.

"
1415,26 july 2019,libra,"Are you on the same page as the people in your world? Today is a good time to find out if you share the same dreams and values. Friends, family, lovers, colleagues…everyone counts. If you discover that there is a difference of opinion, no need to freak out. Cosmic aspects over the next week will help you work through this.

"
1416,27 july 2019,libra,"Well, aren’t you the belle of the ball! Gorgeous Venus just entered your house of socializing, joining the Sun and Mars. Over the next few weeks you will meet new people and reconnect with old friends and business contacts. Speaking of business, this sector happens to govern technology too. If you’re in a tech-heavy field–a blog, online store, social media marketing or website development–hustle while you can.

"
1417,28 july 2019,libra,"If you feel the need to upgrade some of the people you hang out with, date or work with, don’t feel guilty. From your chart it appears that you should be spending more time with people who share your values and interests. This isn’t ruthless; it’s part of growing as an individual and recognizing your needs.

"
1418,29 july 2019,libra,"A colleague, friend or loved one could act out in a surprising way. Maybe they don’t want to play by the rules. Or maybe they just feel like slacking off. Perhaps they woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Let this pass, because in 24 hours things should be back on track.

"
1419,30 july 2019,libra,"Getting lost in trivial details is possible as Neptune swirls its mist. This is especially true at the office or when dealing with friends. You may need to steer people back to a more logical, big picture kind of a place. Otherwise you’ll get sucked in to paralysis by analysis.

"
1420,31 july 2019,libra,"Big plans start to develop momentum now that Mercury is direct in your ambition sector! Other people are going to play a big role in helping you achieve your dreams, so don’t try to fly solo over the next four weeks. Find a mentor. Ask a friend to set you up with someone. Join a master mind group, a club or a charity. The more people you connect with, the better.

"
1421,1 august 2019,libra,"The Leo new moon will bring plenty of people into your life over the next few months, from old friends to new ones. It’s a good time to join a club or take part in a volunteer organization. Steer clear, however, of jealous types and those who think that drama is a good thing. It’s not. This includes a lover, by the way, so if your amour has been too volatile take a timeout!

"
1422,2 august 2019,libra,"Feeling annoyed? Unappreciated? Got one nerve left and everyone’s working it? Yeah, it’s that kind of a day. Gentle Venus is squared by impetuous Uranus, which means that people could be irrational and rude. But this shouldn’t ruin the flow of your precious chi. The Moon is about to enter the most chilled out, metaphysical part of your chart. So get in a lotus pose and start chanting “oohhmmmm.” Namaste.

"
1423,3 august 2019,libra,"The planets are pushing you to socialize, so go ahead and party your little heart out. But don’t be surprised if you feel like calling it a day (or night) a little early so that you can spend some time alone. The Moon is in the most secluded part of your chart, urging you to pamper yourself.

"
1424,4 august 2019,libra,"Friends and family members may offer suggestions to you, and if you’re smart you’ll listen. Their advice may actually be good this time (LOL)! But this doesn’t mean that you have to do what they say; just pay attention. By the way, they’ll still be at it as the week progresses, so be prepared to slow down and take it all in.

"
1425,5 august 2019,libra,"Inspiration could hit you to take much better care of your health, and this is a smart move. There will be a new moon on the 30th in a house that deals with surgery, physical therapy and other major medical issues. This isn’t to say that you’re going to need these modalities. But prevention is the best cure, so the more proactive you are now the less you’ll have to deal with later.

"
1426,6 august 2019,libra,"With erratic Uranus acting up in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, you could fly off the handle easily. And even if you are the picture of serenity someone else could be bouncing off the walls—your  walls. Take a deep breath, count to ten and say “Namaste”. This cosmic sh**storm is over tomorrow.

"
1427,7 august 2019,libra,"Get out of the house. I mean it. You need to be networking and partying your little tuckus off right now, Libra. An amazing Sun-Jupiter aspect indicates that people could be enormously helpful and lucky for you right now. They could introduce you to a new lover or tip you off about a job opening. Invitations could come in to join a club or elite group. But none of this will happen if you’re sitting on the sofa watching TV. Out the door, now!

"
1428,8 august 2019,libra,"Today is perfect for being carefree and having a good time. Does that mean calling in sick to work? Yeah, maybe! At least leave some time for socializing, as a juicy Venus-Jupiter trine brings luck to gatherings. You never know who you might meet. This aspect is amazing for romance: finding new love for singles, or reaching an agreement about shared dreams with a lover.

"
1429,9 august 2019,libra,"If you want to move forward in life with some degree of peace and sanity, it’s critical to work things out with the people in your life. You don’t have to cave in to their demands and do things their way. But some kind of consensus needs to be reached, at home, with a lover and at the office. Some important aspects coming on Sunday will help smooth things over.

"
1430,10 august 2019,libra,"Try to be open minded about people whose opinions are different than your own. Make an attempt, too, to be patient if they seem to be confused or unable to get their point across. Face it, we all have moments like this. Once Jupiter goes direct tomorrow the lines of communication will become clearer.

"
1431,11 august 2019,libra,"Your emotions calm down, it’s easier to communicate, and you’ll be spending more time with friends and people who count. What’s not to like about this forecast? Yup, mighty Jupiter goes direct in your house of self expression, just as chatty Mercury zips into your house of friends and socializing. And Uranus, which has stirring up turbulence in your psyche, goes retrograde—a blessing as you’ll start to chill out!

"
1432,12 august 2019,libra,"Family members need to know where you’re coming from, Libra. This may include some boundaries, the kind that you’ll set. Mature Saturn demands that everyone acts like a grownup, which means releasing old roles and dramas from way  back when.

"
1433,13 august 2019,libra,"Steer clear of known divas and trolls, and stick with the people you can count on to be calm….and fun! There is a lot of planetary activity encouraging you to “upgrade” your life by associating with people who lift you up. With so much planetary activity these days in your house of networking, you may want to be friends with everybody. Sorry, that doesn’t work. Be nice to everyone, but curate who is allowed into your circle.

"
1434,14 august 2019,libra,"A yummy Venus-Sun conjunction could bring new love into your life, someone who is your friend as well as your sexy romantic partner. And if you’re already attached, this energy is super for getting on the same page about shared dreams. Considering that tomorrow’s full moon falls in the house of amour, you need to know what direction things are going in.

"
1435,15 august 2019,libra,"Sweet! The Aquarius full moon shines its light on your love life. Something wonderful could come to fruition, and that includes those of you who are single. Just keep your friends out of your business, as a tense Mercury-Uranus aspect indicates that they might interfere, or be jealous. Their time will come. Now is your moment.

"
1436,16 august 2019,libra,"Raging against the machine–or the system, the team, your loved ones–is not a good plan. Maybe you’re being taken for granted. Perhaps others aren’t playing fair. But losing your cool and pitching a fit will get you nowhere. Chill out, because solutions will arise by next Wednesday.

"
1437,17 august 2019,libra,"You can’t be working all of the time, Libra! A Saturn-North Node opposition warns against spending too much time at the office and/or taking the stress home with you. Fortunately planets will be moving into the most healing, psychological part of your chart next week. You need to unwind. Start today.

"
1438,18 august 2019,libra,"A magnificent period lies ahead for you, Libra, one in which you’ll go through an amazing transformation. Mars is now in your twelfth house of closure and reflection. In the next few weeks other planets will follow, all of them pushing you to take a long look at what’s working in your life and what’s not. This may not always be easy but it is necessary. By the time your birthday season arrives, you may not even recognize yourself!

"
1439,19 august 2019,libra,"The next four days are well aspected for obtaining advice from the people in your world, Libra. Don’t be too proud or shy to ask for it. It would also be beneficial for you to join some kind of a team or group, whether in your personal life or professional one. You’ll gain insight from them and have fun at the same time.

"
1440,20 august 2019,libra,"People in your world may be out of sorts due to a Sun-Moon square. Diplomacy and gentle words may not work, so don’t waste your time! This aspect will be history by tomorrow and the energy is so much more upbeat. So pull away if you can and wait for them to become more agreeable.

"
1441,21 august 2019,libra,"You may be surrounded by people—family, friends, colleagues–who all want to spend some quality time with you! Parties and get togethers may be calling your name. But don’t feel badly about being selective and spending some time alone. Gentle Venus has just entered the quietest, most healing part of your chart. You need to recharge your batteries.

"
1442,22 august 2019,libra,"You want to be a giver and help someone out, but are they capable of handling their own problems? Probably. Don’t fall prey to poor-little-me routines. Sometimes the best way to assist someone is to give them a little guidance, step away and let them figure out what they need to do.

"
1443,23 august 2019,libra,"Hush, child. It’s time to slow down, relax and take good care of yourself, especially your mind. The Sun is now in Virgo, your twelfth house of seclusion and emotional healing. The next three weeks will be powerfully transformative, with every day giving you the opportunity to walk away from the past and its worries.

"
1444,24 august 2019,libra,"Fantasies take flight as Venus and Mars connect in the most secluded, mysterious part of your chart. This could be the sexual and romantic kind of adventure, for sure. But you could also be daydreaming about other grand experiences you’d like to have. Pay close attention to your intuition as it could send you valuable wisdom.

"
1445,25 august 2019,libra,"A passionate side of you emerges, Libra–a side that has been hidden for far too long. This could manifest itself in a romantic relationship. Or your passion could be directed toward a charitable project, or your career. The most important thing is that you share this energy with people who feel the same way you do.

"
1446,26 august 2019,libra,"The sudden realization may hit you that you’re prettier/handsomer, sexier and more passionate than you knew. A wonderful Uranus aspect helps you get in touch with a side of yourself that (a) you’ve never seen before or (b) has been buried for so long you forgot it was there. Better yet is that Uranus is going to be active all week, so get ready to be enlightened.

"
1447,27 august 2019,libra,"Tired of feeling that you need to do things expected of you—from family or society? A Moon-Pluto opposition could get your back up pretty easily. Over the next few days you should do a lot of thinking about this. Some wonderfully healing and metamorphic aspects are at play for the rest of the week.

"
1448,28 august 2019,libra,"An amazing catharsis can happen today, so get ready for a “eureka!” moment. The energy is healing on both a physical and psychological level. Chances are you’ll realize that some of the things you’ve been worried or resentful about just aren’t worth it. Kudos to you! Now move on already.

"
1449,29 august 2019,libra,"Building up your net worth is a good possibility right now, and help could come from an unexpected source. Maybe it’s a friend or family member who is willing to help you with seed money. Your mortgage application may go through without a hitch. But your intuition is very strong, so don’t overlook the chance of having an absolutely genius idea for an investment or business of your own.

"
1450,30 august 2019,libra,"May the healing begin! A new moon in the most cathartic part of your chart could bring a 180 degree change in your mental, emotional and physical health—if you allow it. The problem is that Neptune opposes the Moon, unwilling to get started on the necessary changes that need to be made. But if you want greater vitality and serenity enough, you’ll do what it takes.

"
1451,31 august 2019,libra,"You may be trying to help someone see the light of day, but chances are they’re still in the dark. Hey, you’ve done your best. From now on the best way to be of assistance is to let them figure things out for themselves. It may sound cold, but experience is the best teacher—and you’ll still be there to pick them up when they fall.

"
1452,1 september 2019,libra,"Discretion counts right now. The entire free world does not need to know what’s on your mind and in your heart. Besides, you’re in a lovely spot thanks to Venus encouraging you to pull away from the crazy world and pamper yourself. Take care of #1.

"
1453,2 september 2019,libra,"There is a lot  going on in that brain of yours. A Mars-Sun meet-up will really stir up your psyche, and this is a positive thing. Over the next two weeks you’ll be able to release quite a bit of negative programming. Just keep things to yourself today. People don’t need to know what you’re thinking and planning.

"
1454,3 september 2019,libra,"Your imagination and intuition are working overtime as planets are active in the most mental part of your chart. Your thoughts and ideas could be pure genius, and emotions could be bubbling up as well. But that doesn’t mean that you should be putting all of this out there for everyone to hear. For the next two weeks discretion is the key. Record your thoughts because as the saying goes, “Paper remembers, people forget.”

"
1455,4 september 2019,libra,"There are some happy aspects coming your way in the near future, the kind that will make you feel that all is right with the world. But be wary of taking on too many commitments, especially at the office. People will be more than willing to dump their workload on you, and it could be difficult to dig your way out.

"
1456,5 september 2019,libra,"Your intuition is razor sharp, and it’s starting to impart some wisdom. The next two weeks can be cathartic as you realize that you don’t have to hang on to tired old issues and emotions. As a result a sweet sense of comfort and inner strength is building, and it’s something that no one will be able to take away from you.

"
1457,6 september 2019,libra,"What other people say is not as important as what your own inner wisdom is telling you. There may be well-meaning people in your midst who are anxious to give you advice, but the cosmos recommends ignoring it. Right now you’re in a wonderful place where your emotions and thoughts are balancing out, kind of like nature settling down after a storm. Let this happen at its own pace and without interference.

"
1458,1 january 2019,scorpio,"Your sign appreciates the good life, so you’ll be happy to know that this is one of your best years ever for pulling in more coin. As 2019 begins you are in a highly practical mindset. No rainbows and unicorns for you! If you want to earn and save more, the opportunity is there. Strategize with movers and shakers know how to get things done.

"
1459,2 january 2019,scorpio,"Say what you mean and mean what you say! Your words have power today, thanks to serious Saturn in your house of communicating. It’s the perfect time for negotiations, sales, marketing and social media success. Today is also well aspected for getting your point across to loved ones.

"
1460,3 january 2019,scorpio,"With levelheaded Mercury in one of the most stable parts of your chart, you want to start 2019 off on the right foot. Too bad other people may not share that view! Keep calm and carry on. Don’t let your environment throw off your balance. Preserve that precious chi.

"
1461,4 january 2019,scorpio,"Have you hired a PR agent yet? Or an agent? Or a social media maven? You should! Planets are starting to pile up in your house of self-expression, including Mercury, which arrives today. The next few months are AWESOME for getting your message out there. Creating or revamping a brand is favored. So is partying too!

"
1462,6 january 2019,scorpio,"This is no time to hide in the shadows, Scorpio! A sizzling solar eclipse occurs in your house of self-promotion. This is the also the house of expressing yourself, being verbally, in writing or through artwork. It certainly doesn’t hurt that spunky Uranus goes direct in your house of organization and efficiency too.

"
1463,7 january 2019,scorpio,"Show me the money! Golden girl Venus glides into your house of income and savings, blessing you with its presence. Considering that yesterday’s eclipse occurred in your house of communicating and self-promotion, you should be going loud and proud if you want to see more cash. Social media, blogging, networking events, lecturing and schmoozing are all good options.

"
1464,8 january 2019,scorpio,"You may need to be the voice of reason in a particular situation today. Don’t get caught up in “group think”; the group may have their collective heads up their asses. But don’t expect them to see the light, even if you shine it in their faces. Some people need to learn the hard way.

"
1465,9 january 2019,scorpio,"Don’t be surprised if you get hit with the sudden urge to purge. Jammed up closets, junk drawers, cluttered email accounts, a messy desk….all of these can go bye-bye. Spontaneous Uranus is acting up in your house of efficiency.

"
1466,10 january 2019,scorpio,"Your thoughts will turn to romance as vibey Neptune winks at the amorous Moon. Deep seated emotions could bubble to the surface; acknowledge them. There’s nothing wrong with indulging in a little fantasy today.

"
1467,11 january 2019,scorpio,"This is one of the most potent days in 2019 to get your point across. As a matter of fact, the next three or four days are good too. If people aren’t respecting you, or they’re not listening, it’s time to change things.

"

"
1470,14 january 2019,scorpio,"Not everyone shares your opinions, but that’s not going to be a problem. In fact, you can agree to disagree. Besides, you may find that your thinking begins to change as you open your mind to what others are saying.

"
1471,15 january 2019,scorpio,"Negotiating, strategizing, sharing ideas….all of these are favored right now. But this doesn’t just pertain to power lunches or job interviews. If you need to get things straightened out with loved ones, the next 48 hours are perfect.

"
1472,16 january 2019,scorpio,"Try a different approach when it comes to communicating with others. With chatty Mercury beginning to form a tight angle with transformative Pluto, you should switch up your methods. This is true with the way you write as well as how you speak. Make some progress, why dontcha.

Your ability to get your point across is superb thanks to FOUR planets all in good spots. Two of them happen to be Venus and Mars, so if you need to talk with a lover (or flirt with someone who’s attractive), go for it!

"
1475,19 january 2019,scorpio,"
With so much planetary activity in the mental parts of your chart you should be dreaming up all sorts of juicy ideas. But unpredictable Uranus is on the warpath, which means that a roadblock or unexpected event could stall things. Temporarily, anyway. Once Monday’s eclipse comes, it’s all systems go.

"
1476,20 january 2019,scorpio,"
The Sun moves into Aquarius, your house of domestic matters and contentment. But finding peace could be difficult with a Venus-Neptune square. Loved ones may be hard to figure out, not speaking plainly or acting normally! That’s okay. By tomorrow you’ll be in the driver seat.

"
1477,21 january 2019,scorpio,"
Today brings a watershed moment: a lunar eclipse in Leo, your tenth house of ambition and success. Something that you’ve been working hard on will finally come to pass. But a difficult Mars-Saturn aspect warns against trying to force things through. Take your time and do things right.

"
1479,23 january 2019,scorpio,"

"
1480,24 january 2019,scorpio,"
Creating happiness at home will become important to you now that Mercury is in your domestic sector. The Sun went there on Sunday, so now there is a double dose of planetary energy in this house. Even if you’re single and live alone, you’re going to want to feel comfortable in your own skin.

"
1481,25 january 2019,scorpio,"
Time is money, as the saying goes, and this really applies to Scorpios right now. Make sure that you’re only involved with people, projects and habits that will pay off. Don’t be afraid to cut out the fluff. Be ruthless about how you spend your time.

"
1482,26 january 2019,scorpio,"
One part of your brain is saying to push, and push hard. The other side is asking you what the rush is all about. It’s one thing to be motivated and another to be sloppy. Make sure that you’re giving certain people and situations the time they need.

"
1483,27 january 2019,scorpio,"
News flash: you can’t have things your way all the time! Sorry, Scorpio, but you could be a bit pissy today due to the Moon in your sign. Make nice with other people before they start plotting against you.

"
1484,28 january 2019,scorpio,"
To your surprise, you may actually feel like getting organized today. It’s not the sexiest thing the world to do, that’s for sure. But there is something innately satisfying about organized drawers and closets, not to mention an empty desktop.

"
1486,30 january 2019,scorpio,"

"
1487,31 january 2019,scorpio,"
It’s all well and good to go on flights of fancy but eventually you have to come back to Earth. That said, it’s the dreamers of the world who end up making a mark. Figure out how to dream and do.

"

"
1492,5 february 2019,scorpio,"

"
1497,13 february 2019,scorpio,"
The pace at work could become relentless as high octane Mars meets up with go-getter Uranus. A client, colleague or team effort could spin out of control. The good news is that Mars leaves this part of your chart tomorrow. Just dig in and get the work done.

"

There is some interesting push – pull energy going on in your closest relationships. On the one hand, assertive Mars is saying “go, go, go!” Then on the other hand, retrograde Mercury is warning you to slow down and think about the connection you have with someone. Once the Sun changes signs on Wednesday, things will become clearer.

"
1509,18 march 2019,scorpio,"
Maybe you’re interested in being number one, making it to the top of the heap. But the planets suggest that you’ll get much further if you view others as partners than as rivals. Don’t worry, you’ll still make it to the top!

1560,19 may 2019,scorpio,"Your opinions matter, but other people may not be willing to listen. So you have one of two choices: either to get annoyed that they’re not listening, or to not care. I suppose you could try to force your ideas on them, but it won’t work. Go your own way and live your truth.

"
1561,20 may 2019,scorpio,"Stop selling yourself short, Scorpio. You may think that you don’t have the chops to pull something off. As though maybe you need more skills, a better resume or more talent. Wrong! You DO have what it takes, and if anyone tries to convince you otherwise, then tell them to find someone else to troll.

1564,23 may 2019,scorpio,"Team work makes the dream work? Uh……maybe. People may not be willing to do their jobs. Or maybe they need someone to lead them. Perhaps they need a visionary, which definitely could be you! But you’re better off leading by example than by force.

"
1565,24 may 2019,scorpio,"What you want and what other people want could be two totally different things today, Scorpio. If you can agree to disagree, that’s fine. But a Venus-Moon square indicates that agreements won’t be easy! No problem. Wait until tomorrow when the aspects are much better.

"
1566,25 may 2019,scorpio,"People often don’t realize how grounded you Scorpios can be. They’re too busy focusing on your mysterious personality, trying to figure out what makes you tick. You’re in quite a practical place right now, so don’t hide behind that veil of secrecy. Let others know exactly what’s on your mind.

"
1567,26 may 2019,scorpio,"Carpe diem! Just start living for the moment, Scorpio. There’s only so much planning you can do. And remember this…you don’t need the blessing of other people in order to live day by day. If others are being cranky and stressed out you don’t have to be a part of their pity party. Stay in your own little bubble of contentment.

"
1568,27 may 2019,scorpio,"This is a real firecracker of a day, Scorpio! It’s always good when planets in your house of creativity wink at planets in your house of taking chances. That’s what’s happening, but there is a special twist. The North Node of the moon is activated. The node helps you determine your life’s path. What are you waiting for?

"
1569,28 may 2019,scorpio,"It’s going to take people some time to figure out that you’re right. Fortunately, with your typical casual attitude, you won’t give a hoot if takes them a decade to figure out that 2 + 2=4. Just don’t snicker too much at them, okay?

"
1570,29 may 2019,scorpio,"Scorpions can deliver one hell of a wallop with their legendary stingers, and you may be tempted to do that today. A Mercury-Neptune meltdown stirs up drama and the subsequent stinky emotions. Be careful, my friend: you may lash out at someone close. Remember, once those words are out of your mouth (or you hit the send button) they can’t be taken back.

"
1571,30 may 2019,scorpio,"Start thinking more long term when it comes to your financial picture. For example, a new job may pay more, but will it help you create true wealth? Or are you better off staying where you are and starting a side hustle? Do you really need that luxury item, or would it be smarter to invest that cash in a mutual fund? Take more time to consider your options.

"
1572,31 may 2019,scorpio,"Ggrrr!!! Aren’t you the envy of the zodiac. The two planets of love, Venus and Neptune, are all huggy-kissy face today, which should make everyone happy. But in your case they happen to be in houses that deal with flirting and sex appeal and commitment. Listen, I know that you’re used to being the sex bomb of the cosmos. It’s just that today you have SO much more of an unfair advantage over mere mortals!

"
1573,1 june 2019,scorpio,"You need to know what’s going on in someone’s mind: where they’re coming from, what’s going to happen next. A Jupiter-Venus aspect warns that your usual techniques won’t work, whatever they may be. So consider how you can get the results you want, with diplomacy and a quiet calm.

"
1574,2 june 2019,scorpio,"Sometimes you’re content with letting everyone try to figure things out for themselves. After all, why waste valuable time in pointing out the obvious? But today is a good time to communicate. Tell it to them straight (but be diplomatic in the process).

"
1575,3 june 2019,scorpio,"The new moon in Gemini can work wonders for both your financial and romantic lives. It occurs in your eighth house of net worth, sex and intimacy. But in order for this to happen, you have to be operating with calm logic, not emotions and drama. Don’t let your heart override your head.

"
1576,4 june 2019,scorpio,"“You never know unless you try.” That’s the message behind today’s new Moon in the most adventurous part of your chart. Life is too short to stay stuck in the same old circumstances, Scorpio. You don’t have to quit the day job and join a hippie commune. Take smaller, calculated risks if need be. One of them will build on the ones before, and soon your life will be markedly different.

"
1577,6 june 2019,scorpio,"Being open minded will get you a lot further than being rigid. With the Moon in the most free thinking part of your chart, you should consider someone else’s viewpoint. To your surprise, you may discover that they’re on to something. There’s nothing wrong with admitting that other people have smarts too!

"
1578,7 june 2019,scorpio,"You’ve got game, something that other people will notice over the next few days. Beating you is going to be mighty difficult, so don’t be surprised if others want to be on Team Scorpio.

"
1579,11 june 2019,scorpio,"You and someone close may not see eye to eye today, but that’s no reason to get into an argument. Let it be. By the time Thursday rolls around you’ll be in a much better place to communicate with each other. Maybe you’ll have to use a different approach but it should work.

"
1580,12 june 2019,scorpio,"Don’t be surprised if wanderlust hits you hard. Pack a bag and go, my friend! Or at least start looking into some travel options. Don’t let guilt or responsibilities hold you back. Life is too short to keep things on a bucket list.

"
1581,13 june 2019,scorpio,"“The pen is mightier than the sword.”  “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.” What you say and how you say it count for a lot, Scorpio. Make sure that your words are concise but not too forceful. Eloquence may not be found often in this world, but people know it when they see and hear it!

"
1582,14 june 2019,scorpio,"Let your freak flag fly! This is one of the best days in 2019 to cut loose, and I’m not referring to merely partying (although you could do that too). High octane Mars and inspirational Neptune are telling you to cut any ties that bind you to a boring old self-image and lifestyle. You’ve played it safe long enough. Where has it gotten you?

"
1583,15 june 2019,scorpio,"How high can you fly? The answer to that question depends on you. Right now you’re in the kind of a place where if you can think it, you can do it. And don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

"
1584,16 june 2019,scorpio,"Words are like a double-edged sword–they can cut to the bone, or they can drive a point home with accuracy. Make sure that your words are of the gentler kind today. A difficult Saturn aspect may make it tempting to be blunt, but this will backfire. Use a little honey instead.

"
1585,17 june 2019,scorpio,"First the good news: there’s a glistening full moon in your income sector tonight. You could land a raise, a higher paying job somewhere else or snag a big revenue source  (if you’re self-employed). Now for the warnings: deceptive Neptune is in a tough angle to the moon. Don’t take your newfound cash and start splurging on luxury items. And if you’re in a creative line of work, make sure that you’re going to get paid for your efforts.

"
1586,18 june 2019,scorpio,"You need to loosen up a little, Scorpio. Schedules and goals all have a purpose but sometimes ya just gotta chill out and seize the day. Don’t be so focused on getting from Point A to Point B that you lose sight of that.

"
1587,19 june 2019,scorpio,"They say that talk is cheap, and that pretty much sums up today’s cosmic energy. A Mars-Pluto opposition will bring out the people who are all bluster but no action. They could try to twist your arm into doing something, but with aggressive Mars in your house of higher order thinking, they won’t get too far!

"
1588,20 june 2019,scorpio,"Don’t get too pushy in a close relationship. From your chart it appears that things seem to be shifting in ways that you weren’t expecting. Neptune is going retrograde tomorrow, which will actually help you sort things out.

"
1589,21 june 2019,scorpio,"Adventure is calling your name, Scorpio! The Sun is in Cancer, the most progressive part of your chart. Taking a chance in love or business is favored, along with taking classes and traveling to exotic locales. Neptune retrogrades in your house of romance and creativity, indicating that it’s time to review whether you’re playing it to safe or not. If a person or situation is holding you back, pay attention.

"
1590,22 june 2019,scorpio,"Yesterday inspirational Neptune began to retrograde in your house of romance and creativity. With the Moon now in this part of your chart, it’s a good time to ask yourself where you can add more juice to your life! Considering that a solar eclipse will soon take place in your house of breaking the rules, it’s a good time to view yourself in a new light.

"
1591,23 june 2019,scorpio,"Wishing and hoping that things will magically change just isn’t going to work, Scorpio. The buck stops with you. It’s your responsibility to create better habits, connections and attitudes. You’ll start to realize this on Wednesday when Mercury enters the most authoritative part of your chart.

"
1592,24 june 2019,scorpio,"You have so much to offer the world: why are you hiding on the sidelines? A Venus-Neptune square may be shaking your confidence but this won’t last long. By midweek you’ll start feeling like you’re in control. 

"
1593,25 june 2019,scorpio,"People at the office could be quite demanding and from your chart it looks like you’ve had enough of it. Chiron, the wounded healer, is telling you to set some boundaries. Otherwise you’ll just become resentful and burned out. besides, Mercury enters your career sector tomorrow, so you’ll be able to move on if necessary!

"
1594,26 june 2019,scorpio,"Got #goals? I sure hope so, because strategic Mercury is now in the most ambitious part of your chart. Between now and July 7th you need to take action on the things that mean the most to you. Once the 7th rolls around, the messenger planet retrogrades, but this is actually beneficial. It will give you time to review.

"
1595,28 june 2019,scorpio,"Your words carry weight so use them wisely. It’s a smart time to get your message out there, whatever that may mean: explaining your feelings to a lover, promoting your brand or trying to create change in the world. July will be an intensely busy month for this, so get started now.

"
1596,29 june 2019,scorpio,"Scorpios never back away from a challenge and that holds true today! With shrewd Mercury in the most ambitious part of your chart you’re able to make progress on something that’s important to you. The best part is that you won’t have to run anyone over to succeed; you may actually have support.

"
1597,30 june 2019,scorpio,"You may be tempted to go down a particular path, but what will the cost be? Maybe it’s excessive money or time. Perhaps it’s too much of an emotional commitment. Think before you act.

"
1598,1 july 2019,scorpio,"Prepare for liftoff! High octane Mars zips into your house of ambition and success, and it is determined to get results. You might want to cool those jets, though–Mercury retrogrades here from the 7th through the 19th. Now’s a good time for planning and scheming.

"
1599,2 july 2019,scorpio,"People may be talking at you, trying to knock some sense into your head. But are you sure that they know what they’re talking about? If you have any doubts about that, then stick with your own wisdom.

"
1600,3 july 2019,scorpio,"Nothing, and I mean nothing,  is going to hold you back, Scorpio! Today Venus glides into the most optimistic and daring part of your chart, drawing to you the people and resources you need . Oh….and there’s a whopping solar eclipse taking place there too. You are going to become a force to contend with. But with Saturn in a tense angle, you must remember to plot and plan carefully rather than just diving in.

"
1601,4 july 2019,scorpio,"The naysayers are out there in force today, so unless you want them bursting your shiny red balloon, stay away. Focus instead on your audacious plans, which were set in motion with yesterday’s eclipse. By the way, the trolls will still be out there (on the 9th, 14th and 17th) so avoid them and do your own thing.

"
1602,5 july 2019,scorpio,"Your creativity soars thanks to inspirational Neptune in a fabulous spot! This is a big holiday weekend in the US, but don’t let this energy go to waste. Your career and money situation can improve a lot over the next six months if you’re willing to try something new.

"
1603,6 july 2019,scorpio,"This is a great weekend for cutting loose and hanging out with the tribe! With the Moon in your house of friends and networking, you should be heading to the beach or out to dinner with the people you enjoy the most. There’s a sense of adventure and trying something new, so don’t stick with the same old haunts.

"
1604,7 july 2019,scorpio,"Major goals start to go under review as Mercury retrogrades in your house of ambition and success. One of the things you may be asking yourself is this: am I playing it too safe? With so much planetary activity in your house of taking risks, you may decide to push yourself a bit further than is comfortable. But nothing ventured, nothing gained!

"
1605,8 july 2019,scorpio,"Good luck if anyone tries to dictate to you how you should live your life. A terrific Venus-Uranus aspect will not only make you feel adventurous, it will also put you in the path of like minded people. Surround yourself with the best.

"
1606,9 july 2019,scorpio,"“Your beliefs become your thoughts, your thoughts become your words, your words become your actions.” These words from Gandhi ring true for you today and into the future. Make sure that your thoughts and beliefs are taking you places that you really want to go.

"
1607,10 july 2019,scorpio,"It ain’t easy being charismatic and bold, but you have the chops to pull it off. A magnificent Sun-Neptune trine in the most optimistic and creative parts of your chart puts you front and center. Yeah, I know, you love being mysterious and in the shadows. Not today, my friend! Soak up the limelight.

"
1608,11 july 2019,scorpio,"Diplomacy will be in short supply as Mars squares volatile Uranus. People will be convinced that their opinion is the best and won’t be willing to budge. Creative solutions will start to appear tomorrow and over the weekend.

"
1609,12 july 2019,scorpio,"Sometimes you need a delicate touch to get what you want, rather than coming on too strong. You’ll be able to do just that over the weekend thanks to a gentle Venus-Moon aspect. Smile sweetly and ask away.

"
1610,13 july 2019,scorpio,"Even if your financial situation is not where you’d like it to be, you can make inroads today. Yup, it’s a Saturday but that doesn’t mean that you can’t do some research about other options. Abundant Jupiter, planet of profits, meets up with the passionate Moon in your income sector. Is it time to follow your bliss?

"
1611,14 july 2019,scorpio,"The upcoming eclipse in Capricorn is stirring up your brain waves, which could prompt you to open your mouth and let loose. The problem is that you may come across as being too forceful and this could backfire. Besides, other people have valuable opinions that you should be listening to right now.

"
1612,15 july 2019,scorpio,"You could be quite vocal today, but this is a good thing! The passionate, emotional Moon swings past Pluto and Saturn in your house of communicating. Say what’s on your mind, because your words have power and conviction. People will take notice.

"
1613,16 july 2019,scorpio,"Yowza! A scintillating lunar eclipse puts the final touches on some kind of project that showcases your thinking, writing or speaking skills. It could be career related, such as a screenplay, marketing campaign or contract negotiation. But it also could be personal, like planning an epic party or becoming more of a social butterfly. People may be surprised and even a little pissy, but you’ll be having too much fun to notice.

"
1614,17 july 2019,scorpio,"Play by the rules today, Scorpio. Say what you mean and mean what you say. Think things through first. This is not a good time to be flying by the seat of your pants, saying whatever pops into your mind. Things will loosen up next week.

"
1615,18 july 2019,scorpio,"It’s not easy being charismatic, sexy and fabulous, but somebody’s gotta do it. It looks like it’s your turn, Scorpio! A wonderful Venus-Neptune trine makes you the person to look at and admire today. Make sure that you put on a good show.

"
1616,19 july 2019,scorpio,"Taking bigger risks in life was the theme of the July 3rd eclipse. You’ll be feeling the energy of this lunation for months to come, as new opportunities will come your way. But which ones to choose? Hmm. Fortunately Mercury enters this sector today, helping you to narrow down the possibilities. It’s retrograde, which isn’t a bad thing–it’s positive, as it will make you more reflective.

"
1617,20 july 2019,scorpio,"“Read my lips!” People could demand that you follow their words and instructions to the letter. If it’s a boss or some kind of authority figure, you’d better listen. But if it’s not, that’s another story! Don’t get bullied into following someone else’s rules or agenda if you don’t have to.

"
1618,21 july 2019,scorpio,"For the past four weeks the Sun has been in your house of big picture, blue sky thinking. Hopefully you’ve been considering ways to bust out of a rut and live a bolder lifestyle! This goes for any area of your life, by the way. El Sol is getting ready to leave tomorrow, but today it shakes hands with strategic Mercury. The time for day dreaming is over, so buckle down and plan your next move.

"
1619,22 july 2019,scorpio,"The next four weeks promise to be game changers, Scorpio. Mars is in your tenth house of ambition and success for the first time in two years. The Sun arrives today and Venus shows up on Saturday. With all of this planetary firepower in the most driven part of your chart, you will be unstoppable. Naturally this can positively affect your career, but love, health, friendships and travel are also covered. It’s whatever floats your boat!

"
1620,23 july 2019,scorpio,"It seems like your popularity is on the rise and everyone wants a piece of you! But it’s not just your personality that people are attracted to. You have a can-do attitude which is appealing. Let’s face it, people want to surround themselves with movers and shakers–and that’s what you are.

"
1621,24 july 2019,scorpio,"Your popularity is on the rise at the moment, so don’t even think about crawling back into that protective shell. Yes, I know, you love being mysterious and aloof. But a Mercury-Venus conjunction is shining a big spotlight on you so soak up the attention. Besides, with so much planetary action of achieving important goals, it’s a good thing to be noticed right now.

"
1622,25 july 2019,scorpio,"Your luck in career and money matters is on the rise, so hustle while you can. An auspicious Mars-Jupiter meet up could bring a job offer, new client or increased revenues for your business. This energy is going to be powerful for the following week; be ready to showcase your talent and negotiate like a pro.

"
1623,26 july 2019,scorpio,"Uh, you may need to readjust the way you communicate with others, Scorpio. Aggressive Mars is making you a tad too forceful. There’s nothing wrong with having an opinion or a vision, but you should chill out when it comes to expressing what’s on your mind. Your spoken and written words need to be mature, calm and well thought out.

"
1624,27 july 2019,scorpio,"Good heavens, you’re motivated. The Sun and Mars are in your house of goal achievement and today Venus joins them. If one of your cherished plans is to find serious love, or to make an existing relationship stronger, then this planetary trifecta will help. We crave serious, mature romance when this part of our chart is lit up: no affairs, flings or senseless drama allowed.

"
1625,28 july 2019,scorpio,"Things should start to develop a nice flow. You’ve been pushing hard in all areas of your life and it’s high time that things aren’t always a struggle. This will last for a few weeks, by the way, so enjoy it.

"
1626,29 july 2019,scorpio,"Rebelling against the rules is not a smart way to go today. Nor is taking a “my way or the highway” approach. People in positions of power may notice your attitude, and they’ll remember it. Instead, just suck it up and act like a team player, even if you don’t feel like it. By Wednesday you’ll be back in the driver’s seat.

"
1627,30 july 2019,scorpio,"If you want to make a good impression on people, then let your talent and skills speak for themselves. There’s no need to brag or push hard. You can be the best mom, dad, lover, employee or friend by letting people see that you have an open, creative mind. It’s the people who are rigid who often have the most trouble getting along with others!

"
1628,31 july 2019,scorpio,"You are at the brink of some amazing cosmic aspects, Scorpio. Today Mercury resumes direct motion in your house of taking risks and living more authentically. Then tomorrow there is a new moon in the most ambitious, successful part of your chart! This is really good stuff. Nothing is holding you back, and you’re gonna love it.

"
1629,1 august 2019,scorpio,"Feeling motivated? You should be, considering that a new moon is taking place in the most ambitious part of your chart! Over the next few weeks you can move mountains, but I warn you–you’ll most likely be moving them by yourself. Not everyone in your world wants to be a team player. Of course, once they see what you achieve, they’ll wish that they had been on your side.

"
1630,2 august 2019,scorpio,"Someone may be intent to undermine your authority, or some kind of plan that you’re working on. And it could come as a surprise too. No problem….let them think they’ve succeeded. They haven’t, something they’ll find out the hard way next week, oh around Wednesday. You will be in the driver’s seat and the trolls will just end up as roadkill.

"
1631,3 august 2019,scorpio,"Take a break from your frenetic schedule and party with your friends, why dontcha. Or a lover; someone who knows how to have a good time. You have SO much intense planetary energy going on in the ambition part of your chart that you run the risk of burning out. Recharge your batteries all weekend long because next week is going to be 120 mph all the way.

"
1632,4 august 2019,scorpio,"Put your money where your mouth is, Scorpio. It’s time to go loud and proud about your talent. Crush it on social media. Negotiate like a champ. Strategize like a five-star general. This energy returns on Friday, so you have the entire week to make things happen.

"
1633,5 august 2019,scorpio,"You’re no stranger to mystery. Nor are you afraid to turn up the sex appeal. Therefore you’ll absolutely love today’s sizzling Moon-Neptune aspect. It’s a time to satisfy your fantasies and feel alive. Take advantage of it, because there is a LOT of energy later in the week in your career sector….and you’ll be back to taking care of business.

"
1634,6 august 2019,scorpio,"Feeling a bit territorial? Not surprising with a Moon-Uranus opposition. People could be unpredictable and you won’t be in the mood for their nonsense. Inner balance means a lot to you. So if it looks like anyone intends to rain on your parade, you’ll protect your serenity….as you should.

"
1635,7 august 2019,scorpio,"Lady Luck–otherwise known as the planet Jupiter–is smiling at you for the next few days! Considering that the gas giant is in your house of income and savings, you are in an awesome position to bolster your earnings. Jupiter trines the Sun in your house of goals, indicating that other important dreams of yours could also come to pass. It’s all about building a strong foundation, something that you long to do.

"
1636,8 august 2019,scorpio,"Confidence is sexy and you’ve got plenty of it! A simmering Venus-Jupiter trine brings out your personal magnetism. Use this to impress muckety mucks in the business world. Let a lover know that you’re a damn good catch (although a bit of humility might be in order). Things that you set in motion now will have long term consequences that you’ll enjoy.

"
1637,9 august 2019,scorpio,"A show of force is not needed today. If you want to get your way–and we know  that you do–the best way to go about it is to be chilled out and eloquent, rather than getting in someone’s face. This is an important time, as the decisions you make and plans that you set in motion will have long lasting consequences. Don’t let impatience take over.

"
1638,10 august 2019,scorpio,"Heaven knows you’re no stranger to drama. But emotional ups and downs can exact a toll on your energy levels and happiness. A Sun-Neptune aspect suggest that you reconsider just how much drama you want to accept in your life. Is it time to dial it down a notch?

"
1639,11 august 2019,scorpio,"Lookin’ good, Scorpio. Jupiter goes direct in your house of income, opening up doors that may have been closed over the past few months. Then smart Mercury joins the Sun in your success sector. This all bodes well for making progress, but is a lover or business partner on board? That’s the question as Uranus starts to retrograde in your house of serious relationships.

"
1640,12 august 2019,scorpio,"You say what you mean and you mean what you say! A powerful Saturn-Moon aspect enables you to get your point across in a big way. No screaming or ultimatums though. Just direct statements that leave no one in doubt as to where you stand. Who says that Scorpios are always so damn mysterious?

"
1641,13 august 2019,scorpio,"You’re not one to suffer fools gladly, and today’s planetary action will put you to the test. That’s because the fools are out there en masse. What to do? Tell them that they have their heads up their rear ends? Or just let them figure it out for themselves, which could take a long time? That’s up to you to decide.

"
1642,14 august 2019,scorpio,"You have a sexy, confident swagger about you….but then you already knew that, didn’t you? You’re probably saying to yourself “that’s  the big cosmic story today?”  It is, so cut me some slack. Go out there and strut your stuff. And if you’re one of the few Scorpios out there whose self-esteem is in the toilet, today’s Sun-Venus aspect is perfect for getting your mojo back.

"
1643,15 august 2019,scorpio,"Major decisions about your family and home life need to be made, and now is the best time in 2019 to do so. The Aquarius full moon highlights your domestic situation. This sector also governs your inner sense of well being and comfort, so make a vow to live with a sense of serenity. Changes will probably have to be made in order to do that, but it will be worth it.

"
1644,16 august 2019,scorpio,"Boundaries need to be set with people. This may not be something you want to do, but from your chart it appears to be necessary. Calmly let them know that you’re not going to be put upon. Better yet, set a good example for them. Next week the energy changes in your favor as planets start to move into the teamwork part of your chart.

"
1645,17 august 2019,scorpio,"Sometimes in life it seems as though we’re not being heard, as if our opinions don’t count. You could feel this today due to a Saturn-North Node opposition. Next week brings some interesting aspects as planets move into your house of connecting with others. Are you associating with the right kind of people? if not you’ll have the chance to meet some new ones!

"
1646,18 august 2019,scorpio,"Who says that you’re standoffish and secretive? Please! You’re going to be the life of the party wherever you go, Scorpio. That’s because high octane Mars just entered Virgo, your eleventh house of networking. You can use this energy for making new friends or finding a lover. Make new business connections. Join a volunteer organization. Some amazing new connections are coming your way.

"
1647,19 august 2019,scorpio,"Your confidence gets a boost from a Mercury-Moon aspect. The realization hits you that yes, I CAN do this! Break big things down into little bite sized chunks, and “nibble” on one little chunk at a time. Process is the key.

"
1648,20 august 2019,scorpio,"The Sun will be leaving your house of goals in a few days. From your chart it appears that you’re frantically trying to catch up on things, but please….take it easy! You’ll be able to get more help from others over the next four weeks. Stop trying to do everything on your own.

"
1649,21 august 2019,scorpio,"You have been the go-getter of the zodiac for the past four weeks, but now it’s time to relax a little. Vivacious Venus enters your house of friends and partying, so start making plans. New people could come into your life too, especially after the new moon on the 30th. The biggest problem will be rationing your time with people so they don’t feel left out!

"
1650,22 august 2019,scorpio,"You may be convinced that you’ve got everything under control, and you’re probably right. But doing things the same old way will get you predictable results. Why not try a more creative method? If you need a mentor then wait until the Sun enters your house of networking and wisdom tomorrow.

"
1651,23 august 2019,scorpio,"It’s time to crawl out of your protective shell, Scorpio! And you can put the stinger away too, as the Sun rolls into the friendliest part of your chart. You are in for one really  lively month ahead. Expect friends, lovers (notice that’s plural) and business colleagues to be texting you, setting up dinner dates. But you could also make some exciting new acquaintances, and that’s likely yo happen next week.

"
1652,24 august 2019,scorpio,"OK, we get it…you’re the sexiest sign of the zodiac. Which means that today’s Venus-Mars meetup is just one more excuse for you to enjoy the sensual side of life. But these planets are joining forces in your house of networking and hanging out with friends, so don’t hide away with a lover. You can enjoy their company later in the evening! For now, make plans to hang out with the tribe first.

"
1653,25 august 2019,scorpio,"The way a team, family or group handles things needs to be revised, for everyone’s sanity! But that doesn’t mean that you should push too hard to make those changes. Sometimes people need to figure things out for themselves. A little prodding on your part may be all that’s needed.

"
1654,26 august 2019,scorpio,"People could be unusually cooperative and true to your Scorpio nature, you’ll be saying “what’s the catch?”  The fact is that there is none. Sparkling Uranus is in a diplomatic mood, making friends, team members and colleagues a lot more easy going than usual. This energy runs til the end of the week so work it!

"
1655,27 august 2019,scorpio,"“Group think” is an issue today as people are determined to keep everyone in line. The problem is, you have no intention or desire to think like everyone else (so what else is new?). You can try to fight these limited people or do what you do best–pull away and think your usual sarcastic, yet realistic, thoughts.

"
1656,28 august 2019,scorpio,"People could be in a hurry to partner up with you, both in business and your personal life! It’s not surprising, considering all of the good things you have going for you. The only problem is selecting who you’re going to allow in. This isn’t ruthless, it’s smart. Friday’s new moon occurs in your house of networking and it’s going to open up a lot of doors.

"
1657,29 august 2019,scorpio,"Mercury zips into your house of friends and networking, encouraging you to socialize more. However, this also happens to be the house where you hold cherished dreams and values. Do the people in your world share your ideals? If not, then tomorrow’s new moon is the perfect time to align with like minded souls.

"
1658,30 august 2019,scorpio,"People could be touchy these days, demanding more of your time and attention than you can give. That’s because of all of the planetary action in your networking sector. A new moon occurs here today, bringing in even more potential friends, lovers and colleagues! It may reach a point where you’re going to have to select who stays and who goes. Hint: drop the people who don’t truly support you.

"
1659,31 august 2019,scorpio,"Balancing your time between family, friends and a lover could be a challenge right now. Are you stretched too thin? If there are other commitments that are cutting into quality time with these people, you need to make some serious decisions. Over the next three weeks spending time with people who count is of paramount importance.

"
1660,1 september 2019,scorpio,"Don’t be surprised if you’re surrounded by people who want to get to know you better! An amazingly social energy is going on in your chart right now, and your personal magnetism is running high. Joining a volunteer organization, club or sports team is a great idea too. The more, the merrier.

"
1661,2 september 2019,scorpio,"Social activities are picking up steam thanks to loads of planetary activity in your house of friends and networking! However, watch your spending. If people are planning extravagant bachelorette parties or weddings don’t feel as though you have to lay out the cash. The same goes for expensive dinners, drinks and clothing. It’s great to have fun, but going broke in the process doesn’t make any sense.

"
1662,3 september 2019,scorpio,"Momentum is building in your house of friends and networking, so expect to be busy socializing and schmoozing! However, when it comes to teamwork, some people may be slacking off. Or maybe they don’t truly understand what is expected of them. Make it clear, otherwise things will go off the rails.

"
1663,4 september 2019,scorpio,"Feel caught between a rock and a hard place? It might seem that way, especially when it comes to the people in your life who may be at odds with each other. Avoid taking sides and be as objective as possible. You don’t want to get involved in this! (FYI: this energy returns on Saturday).

"
1664,5 september 2019,scorpio,"Advice from a friend or mentor could be incredibly helpful, so don’t feel shy about asking their opinion. If you’re not convinced that someone you already know has the right answers then seek out someone new. This could be an online authority as intelligent Mercury is lighting up your technology sector.

"
1665,6 september 2019,scorpio,"For heaven’s sake, stop nitpicking and focusing on every little thing that displeases you. There is fabulous cosmic energy encouraging you to get together with friends for drinks or dinner. The weekend is almost here–why not go to an event that involves a hobby or interest of yours? Think antiques show, ComicCon, a dog show, flea market, street fair. You can nitpick later if you feel like it!

"
1666,1 january 2019,sagittarius,"2019 is shaping up to be your year, Sagittarius. With abundant Jupiter in your sign for the first time in over a decade, there’s nothing holding you back….except you! And that’s not going to happen. So pull out a piece of paper and make your bucket list. Cheers!

"
1667,2 january 2019,sagittarius,"If making more money is part of your 2019 plan, today is the time to take action. Saturn, the planet of discipline and long term success, meets up with the fiery Sun in your income sector. The decisions you make will be well thought out and balanced.

"
1668,3 january 2019,sagittarius,"Loved ones could be acting up today, laying on guilt trips or acting wonky. With intelligent Mercury in your sign, though, you’ll see right through it. Just laugh it off and keep going about your day.

"
1669,4 january 2019,sagittarius,"Shrewd Mercury enters your money sector, good news for those of you who want to earn (and save) more this year. The planets are lining up to bring you more stability in all areas of your life. The eclipse next Sunday is a game changer, so be prepared to create a stronger foundation.

"
1670,5 january 2019,sagittarius,"It’s OK to dig back into the past and hash out old memories! Sometimes this can be painful, but today it’s advisable. You’ll be able to come to some fresh new understandings about yourself and other people. Forgive, forget and move on.

"
1671,6 january 2019,sagittarius,"Things are going to start picking up momentum for you, archer. Erratic Uranus goes direct in your house of romance, enabling matters of the heart to run more smoothly. In an interesting coincidence, a solar eclipse occurs in your house of stability. This sector also governs your income, so between now and July you could definitely pull in more dinero.

"
1672,7 january 2019,sagittarius,"Damn, you’re looking good. That’s because gorgeous Venus is now in your sign! And if you think your self-image could use an update, the next three weeks are a good time for a makeover.

"
1673,9 january 2019,sagittarius,"Life’s too short to play by the rules, something that your sign is perfectly aware of. And today is a good time to toss aside your worries and have some fun. Even if you have  to go to work, try to carve out some play time later. Unless, of course, you decide to call in sick……but I won’t tell.

"
1674,10 january 2019,sagittarius,"It’s a great day for reminiscing about the past. Honor your ancestors by going through old photos. Light a candle for them and say a prayer of thanks. Contact an older relative and learn more about their life story; you might be surprised at what you discover.

"
1675,11 january 2019,sagittarius,"Money matters shouldn’t be getting the best of you, Sagittarius. You should be in control of it…..not the other way around. Which is why you need to pay attention to today’s cosmic energy. Transformational Pluto has your back, encouraging you to get on track with earning more and saving more.

"
1676,12 january 2019,sagittarius,"This weekend is a bit wonky. Today you could be operating on pure emotion and passion. By tomorrow your mind will be all logic and rational thinking. But somewhere in the middle you could find a sweet spot!

"
1677,13 january 2019,sagittarius,"Don’t kid yourself about an important issue. Likewise, don’t let others use guilt or memories of the “good old times” in order to manipulate you. What counts right now is a strong foundation. Do you have one?

"
1678,14 january 2019,sagittarius,"You’re known as being one of the fiercest signs of the zodiac. But today’s energy encourages you to be a homebody. Take a break from the rat race. Pour yourself a glass of wine. Read a book. Recharge your batteries.

"
1679,15 january 2019,sagittarius,"Surround yourself with people who are willing to chip in and get things done, archer. There is no room in your life for flakes or hangers on. Make sure that everyone knows what their roles are as well as the deadlines. This is just as true in your personal life as it is in your professional one.

"
1680,16 january 2019,sagittarius,"Consider fresh new ways to eat and nourish your body. With so much planetary activity in your house of habits and health, this is the perfect time to change your routines.

"
1681,17 january 2019,sagittarius,"
With sultry Venus in your sign you’re bound to draw attention to yourself. The question is: do you want it? Maybe not today. But tomorrow is another story completely!

"
1682,18 january 2019,sagittarius,"
You’re playing for keeps. Not only when it comes to love, or money, but every single area of your life. Which means that you are a force to contend with.

"
1683,19 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Drama and adventure are two different things. Adventure is generally a good thing as it pushes us past previous limits and enriches our life experience. Drama, on the other hand, can be downright debilitating. Make sure you’re choosing the right people and circumstances in your life.

"
1684,20 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Got a lot on your mind? Then you’re in a good place. The Sun enters Aquarius, your third house of thinking, speaking, writing and getting your message out to the world. This is a great time for socializing, finding new love or developing your brand. Just don’t let anyone butt in to your business.

"
1685,21 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Your sign is famous for entering where angels fear to tread. So you’re going to love today’s cosmic activity: a lunar eclipse in your house of adventure! But even an intrepid archer needs to take their time. Disciplined Saturn warns you to make sure there is a steady foundation underneath your feet before you take flight.

"
1686,22 january 2019,sagittarius,"
This could easily be one of the luckiest days of the year for you, Sagittarius. That’s because magnetic Venus and lucky Jupiter meet up in your sign. If you haven’t figured out what you’d like to accomplish yet in 2019, today is a fabulous day for thinking about it….and then taking action.

"
1687,23 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Your head and your heart are not working in sync today. Well, since you can’t trust either one, don’t! Wait until tomorrow when intelligent Mercury enters your house of thinking. 

"
1688,24 january 2019,sagittarius,"
You’re turning into quite the brainiac! The mighty Sun entered your house of thinking and communicating on Sunday, and today shrewd Mercury goes there too. While other people fantasize, you can actually dream big and make it happen.

"
1689,25 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Call the fire department! You’re the hottest thing on two legs. With look-at-me Mars winking at lucky Jupiter, you’ll be turning heads. It’s a great time to show off your “stuff”: that gorgeous face but also your portfolio, resume or wealth of ideas.

"
1690,26 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Friends and lovers could be agitated today, so stay out of their path….and out of their personal arguments with other people. If you want to schedule a “play date” with yourself, that’s not such a bad idea.

"
1691,27 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Your sign is famous for being bold and outspoken, but today isn’t the time to go loud and proud. The Moon is in a tough spot from the confidentiality sector, indicating that you need to keep some things to yourself. Hidden detractors could be out there waiting to pounce.

"
1692,28 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Why not be a little coy today, Sagittarius? The entire world doesn’t need to know what you’re thinking or planning. A little mystery can be a good thing. 

"
1693,29 january 2019,sagittarius,"
This is one of the best days in 2019 to get your message out there, whatever that may mean. Writers, bloggers, students, teachers, lecturers: you should be on fire. So should sales/marketing people and artists. But you can also use this energy to flirt or tell someone how much you care.

"
1694,30 january 2019,sagittarius,"
“Take your passion and make it happen!” That line comes from the ’80’s movie “Flashdance”. No, I’m not telling you to get out your ripped sweatshirts and dance leggings. I’m telling you to after what makes your heart sing. 

"
1695,31 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Rules may be rules that doesn’t mean that they’re set in stone. Stop living life by someone else’s agenda. Even if you have to–like at the office–you can still change things up a little.

"
1696,1 february 2019,sagittarius,"
A stubborn Mars-Pluto square could make you feel confined and ready to bust out into a new groove.  Don’t waste your energy raging against the machine; wait until tomorrow, when you can do this without the anger!

"
1697,2 february 2019,sagittarius,"
This is the last day that magnetic Venus will be in your sign for awhile, so work it, honey. Unpredictable Uranus could put you in the path of someone who finds you quite interesting. 

"
1698,3 february 2019,sagittarius,"
You don’t need to be aggressive to get ahead in business or money matters. Magnetic Venus is now in your house of income. Yes, you’ll still have to put in the effort. But you won’t have to bash people over the head to reach your goals.

"
1699,4 february 2019,sagittarius,"
This is one of the best times in 2019 to network, socialize and get your message out there. The Aquarius new Moon occurs in your house of self-expression. Use it to flirt, get a new job, make new friends or to simply party hearty.

"
1700,5 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Keep everything on the level today. Say what you mean and mean what you say. There is no need for blustering or buttering people up. Just be you, straightforward as usual.

"
1701,6 february 2019,sagittarius,"
There is a LOT of planetary activity in your house of thinking and communicating, so much so that you may feel as though your brain is fried. Take some down time today just for yourself and get quiet. Meditate, read a good book, have a glass of wine and just chill.

"
1702,7 february 2019,sagittarius,"
People around you may be in need of your support, and this is a good time to help them. With optimistic Jupiter in your sign you have the warmth, charisma and wisdom to make a difference in someone’s life.

"
1703,8 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Creative ideas could be buzzing through your mind at lightning like speed. No problem with that! These are thoughts that you can take to the bank. Or ideas for a fabulous party. Maybe you want to ask someone out. Does your self-image need a makeover? Go for it! 

"
1704,9 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Do not…..I repeat, do not….get locked in to a particular plan or schedule today! Especially if it involves the food store, cleaning your house, yada yada yada. Spunky Uranus is telling you to drop everything and HAVE SOME FUN. 

"
1705,10 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Get things out in the open with loved ones, Sagittarius. Holding things in doesn’t help anyone. Over the next few weeks you can make a lot of headway.

"
1706,13 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Something quite unexpected in the love department could happen, something fast and possibly delightful. But you could also go head to head with a lover and have a spat. Don’t say words that you can’t take back.

"
1707,14 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Get physical with your honey this Valentine’s Day! Sexy Mars just zipped into your house of sports and vitality. Diet and exercise together through the end of March. Single archers could find love wherever people are active, such as the gym, beach or tennis court.

"
1708,16 february 2019,sagittarius,"
People may use guilt, fear or other “interesting” emotions to try to get their way, Sagittarius. But with tough guy Pluto in a practical place, you’ll have none of it. If that means letting others know they’ve crossed a line, so be it.

"
1709,24 february 2019,sagittarius,"
There is a successor guru out there who says that “your income can only grow to the level that your mind grows.” In other words, if you think you’re going to always be broke, you will be. Transformative Pluto is active in your earnings sector today, helping you feel more confident about pulling in big bucks.

"
1710,10 march 2019,sagittarius,"
You’re going to be in a highly practical state of mind today and for the rest of the week. But that doesn’t mean that others will be. No problem. What matters is your inner peace and contentment.

"
1711,11 march 2019,sagittarius,"
You can never tell if a certain project or idea is going to work out. But with disciplined Saturn in your house of creating rituals and routines, you are in excellent position to build success into whatever it is that you’re planning. Just make sure to remain flexible in the process.

"
1712,12 march 2019,sagittarius,"
You may be feeling upbeat and full of swagger, but the people around you could be down in the dumps. What’s an archer to do–join this freakin’ pity party? Methinks not! Let them snap out of it and talk with them tomorrow when the mood changes.

"
1713,13 march 2019,sagittarius,"
You like to go with the flow, but right now you need to structure your days and routines. Before you start screaming “But that’s not fun!”, know that the Sun enters your house of flirting, shopping, dining out and attending cultural events next week.

"
1714,14 march 2019,sagittarius,"
If you feel the need to get things off your chest, speak up, for heaven’s sake! Verbal Mercury is in your house of inner contentment. Holding things in is a surefire way to be resentful and sad. Don’t let others walk all over you.

"
1715,15 march 2019,sagittarius,"
With creative, optimistic Jupiter in your sign, you are full of bright ideas and the desire to have fun. That doesn’t mean, however, that other people share your joie de vivre. The heck with them! Go your own way.

"
1716,16 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Don’t be surprised if you feel like a homebody these days. The Sun and Mercury are both cruising through your domestic sector, urging you to spend time relaxing at home with loved ones. Planetary energy is going to change next week, so recharge your batteries now.

"
1717,17 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Pay closer attention to other people’s needs, archer. You are currently in an excellent cosmic position to create strong relationships with family members, a lover and business colleagues. The best part is that you will feel more content and at ease afterwards.

"
1718,18 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Your ideas and opinions are valuable, Sagittarius. Even if other people can’t see the value in them, you should. With the Sun getting ready to enter your house of creativity and talent, these ideas can take flight.

"
1719,19 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Try to get caught up on errands at home and projects at the office, Sagittarius. The Sun is getting ready to enter the most fun-loving part of your chart. Do you really want to be working late at work when you could be out having fun? I didn’t think so.

"
1720,20 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Why do you feel so darn obligated?  The Sun moves into the most fun-loving part of your chart, but your mind seems to be on work and money and family matters. Let this other stuff go, archer, at least a little bit. You need some well deserved down time.

"
1721,21 march 2019,sagittarius,"
The full moon could accelerate a team project in some way. This could be something that you’re working on with your family, friends or colleagues. It could also be a volunteer effort or something in the neighborhood. Watch out though–people could get pushy and want things done NOW. You may need to put them in a more realistic frame of mind.

"
1722,22 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Like Leos, you’re not the type to let weaknesses show…or past hurts or current dramas. So if you need to go off into a corner today and lick your wounds, do so. Chiron, the Wounded Healer, is in an excellent position to help you move on.

"
1723,23 march 2019,sagittarius,"
A battle may erupt between thinking practically versus being creative and fluid. Which side will win? The cosmic jury is out on that one. Give it time. The upcoming week has good aspects that will help you feel more at ease.

"
1724,24 march 2019,sagittarius,"
This could be a sentimental day, a good time to remember the past….or to create brand new memories! With Venus getting ready to enter your warm and fuzzy domestic sector, your family and lover will become even more important to you.

"
1725,25 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Who cares if it’s a Tuesday? The Moon is in your sign and it’s winking flirtatiously at the Sun in your house of romance, shopping and dining. It’s a good day to call out sick, but if you can’t do that, at least go out later and have some fun.

"
1726,27 march 2019,sagittarius,"Spending more time at home is actually becoming appealing, archer. With so much planetary activity in your domestic sector, quality time with loved ones is a priority. And if that “loved one” is yourself, so be it!

"
1727,31 march 2019,sagittarius,"The cosmos seems determined to find you romance and commitment, archer! Ten days ago, the Sun entered your house of amour. And today energetic Mars enters your house of serious relationships. The next 3 to 4 weeks are your best time in 2019 to lock in a major romantic chapter.

"
1728,7 april 2019,sagittarius,"Sagittarius: The recent new moon fell in your house of wining and dining and shopping, but today has a more down home feel. If you need to recharge your batteries, then take a break from the party circuit and just chill out. Don’t worry, you’ll be ready to have some fun before the week is out.

"
1729,8 april 2019,sagittarius,"Take a break if you need one, Sagittarius. With the moon in the most productive part of your chart you probably are pushing yourself way too hard. This week brings a lot of warm and fuzzy aspects that recommend cocooning at home. Pour yourself a glass of wine or cup of tea and read a good book.

"
1730,9 april 2019,sagittarius,"Over the next few days, you could have some concerns about either a financial or romantic matter. A Sun-Saturn square could find you thinking with both your heart and your head. Let your head win this battle, my friend. Under current cosmic skies it’s better to be logical than emotional.

"
1731,10 april 2019,sagittarius,"Big changes ahead….Jupiter goes retrograde today in your sign. Between now and August 11th you may do a lot of thinking about where you’re heading next in life. This is actually a good thing, as you may have been suffering from “shine object syndrome”–chasing after too many things. Give yourself time to sort things out.

"
1732,11 april 2019,sagittarius,"There is a strong wave of nostalgia running through your chart right now, archer. You may be frequently thinking about the past, about people who may no longer be here. Honor their memory by taking out their photos and putting them in nice frames. Create a little shrine, a place where you can go every day to thank these people (and pets!) for being in your life.

"
1733,12 april 2019,sagittarius,"People could get on your nerves today, especially if they’re whiny and feeling sorry for themselves. You don’t have the time and patience for this nonsense, so pull away if need be. Surround yourself instead with people who know how to enjoy life.

"
1734,13 april 2019,sagittarius,"A battle is brewing in your mind: should you stick with the tried and true, or branch out into new things? Don’t try to resolve this today. A productive Sun-Jupiter aspect tomorrow will help you see things in a different light.

"
1735,15 april 2019,sagittarius,"Don’t kid yourself about unsettling emotions, archer—they’re trying to tell you something. If something seems off, it most likely is. Don’t make any decisions just now, though; wait for the Sun to enter Taurus this Saturday.

"
1736,16 april 2019,sagittarius,"Passive-aggressive behavior could be coming from people in your world; make sure that it doesn’t come from you! Jupiter is retrograde in your sign, which could make you a bit confused about things. But don’t resort to snarky verbal games. Leave that to the trolls.

"
1737,17 april 2019,sagittarius,"Are you in the mood for love? I sure hope so, because vivacious Mercury glides into your house of romance today. Amorous Venus shows up on Saturday. But you won’t be walking around with stardust in your eyes. Despite the mushy energy, you’ll be own to Earth as the Sun will be in the most grounded part of your chart.

"
1738,18 april 2019,sagittarius,"People who bring more chaos than happiness into your life need to go on a “watch list”! Seriously, watch their behavior. If something is off you may need to cut these ties. Tomorrow’s full moon is the time to do so.

"
1739,19 april 2019,sagittarius,"Team efforts count for a lot these days, courtesy of the full moon in your house of friends and group activities. With the Sun entering your house of efficiency tomorrow, you are now in an excellent place to rally the troops.

But it won’t be all work and no play: romantic Venus enters your house of flirting and love too! Rest up….you’re going to be busy.

"
1741,21 april 2019,sagittarius,"Your sign is famous for taking risks but it seems that you’ve been playing it too safe lately. That needs to change, stat! With the passionate Moon in your sign it’s time to get a little creative with your self image and attitude. Just who do you want to be?

"
1742,22 april 2019,sagittarius,"A sudden urge to get your act together could happen, so if it does, take note. The fiery Sun meets up with unpredictable Uranus in your house of habits and efficiency. From the way you handle projects to the office to the way you diet and exercise, everything could be revamped.

"
1744,24 april 2019,sagittarius,"Money talks, and it’s having a serious conversation with you right now. Probing Pluto goes retrograde in your house of income and savings. The next few months are superb for researching investments and new business opportunities (which includes a new job or even changing fields). Saturn is going to start spinning backwards here next week, so it’s critical to remain conservative when it comes to your finances.

"
1745,25 april 2019,sagittarius,"Your relationship with money is going to change over the next few months.The way you earn, save and invest it are going to change. It won’t be an overnight process, but it is now under way. The bottom line is that you’re going to become a lot more conservative in your approach, and your ability to research new income sources will skyrocket.

"
1746,26 april 2019,sagittarius,"Today is one of those days when you might end up kicking yourself. For what, you ask? Oh, things like forgetting to mail a bill, or putting gas in your car. Not staying on top of things at the office or at home. Being so busy that important details and dates are overlooked. Slow down, archer, and do things right.

"
1747,27 april 2019,sagittarius,"No matter how much you want to see people get along and be happy, it just may not happen! Murky Neptune is stirring up weird emotions and behavior in others. Playing the role of peace maker could be a waste of time. This passes by Tuesday, so do your own thing for the next 72 hours.

"
1748,28 april 2019,sagittarius,"It’s not your destiny in life to be broke and worrying about money all the time. What you need is better planning and a more secure source of income, something that you’ll be able to figure out over the next few months. Wealth is not something for “other people”; you can enjoy it too.

"
1749,29 april 2019,sagittarius,"It’s time to become a lot more conservative with your finances, archer. Saturn goes retrograde in your house of income and savings. The upside to this is that you could uncover new sources of income that could dramatically increase your bottom line. Pluto happens to be retrograde here too, and considering that this is the planet of research, you’re in a good position.

"
1750,30 april 2019,sagittarius,"No matter how badly you crave a firm foundation under your feet, you may have to wait a bit. Neptune and Mars are in a tiff, creating murkiness and aggression. It’s easy to lose your cool under this kind of cosmic energy. Remember, inner peace is one of the strongest foundations you could have.

"
1751,1 may 2019,sagittarius,"Sexy and smart, all rolled into one package? Yeah, that sounds like you! With intelligent Mercury winking at lusty Mars today, you can impress just about everyone. Have fun.

"
1752,2 may 2019,sagittarius,"Don’t expect people to be logical and calm. Heck, even you might be way too emotional today. A Mercury-Pluto square is the problem, but it disappears quickly. Tomorrow is a much better time when your feelings will be on an even keel.

"
1753,3 may 2019,sagittarius,"Life is short, too short to waste all of your time on your worries and responsibilities. A happy Mercury-Jupiter trine tells you to enjoy yourself, nice timing considering that the weekend is here. So go ahead–flirt, party, dine out, take in a movie, enjoy sports. You’ve earned it.

"
1754,4 may 2019,sagittarius,"It’s time to get with the program! If you been procrastinating on tasks or letting junk pile up in your car, home or office, it’s cleanup time. Tonight’s  new moon occurs in your house of efficiency and organization. Over the next few months you should be able to get caught up and even ahead. Trust me, you’ll feel less stressed and a lot happier as a result.

"
1755,5 may 2019,sagittarius,"People could get pushy, and they may be hell bent on getting you to do what they want. Naturally this won’t sit well with the independent archer. Fortunately you are in a diplomatic, cooperative place. You can choose to work with these people, or just say the hell with it and walk away!

"
1756,6 may 2019,sagittarius,"Shrewd, level headed Mercury is now in your house of getting things done, sooooo…..there’s no excuse! If you’re out of shape or have been plagued with health problems, guess what. There’s no excuse for that either. Do what you have to do.

"
1757,7 may 2019,sagittarius,"Is it worth it to play by the rules? That’s the question posed by the cosmos today. You may not feel like it, but then again, it may be necessary. Your creativity and desire for living boldly is high; channel it the right way.

"
1758,8 may 2019,sagittarius,"Doing things the same old way may feel comfortable, but it isn’t always smart….or productive. Uranus, planet of brilliant ideas, teams up with Mercury in your house of efficiency. You could hit upon a hack, routine or system that will free up time and reduce your stress level.

"
1759,9 may 2019,sagittarius,"Chances are that you are going to totally ignore restrictions. Doing things the same old way just doesn’t cut it for you anymore. A sparkling Jupiter-Venus aspect will encourage you to take chances in all areas of your life, and this is a good thing!

"
1760,10 may 2019,sagittarius,"Your head and your heart could be at odds today, and chances are logic will win out over emotions. But this may be necessary. Tough guys Pluto and Saturn are retrograde in your house of routines and stability, demanding that you remove any rose colored glasses that you’ve been sporting lately.

"
1761,11 may 2019,sagittarius,"You’re famous for being one of the most free spirited signs of the zodiac, but today you’re ready to buckle down and get things done. This super-organized Martha Stewart kind of mood is going to last into next week, so rest up and dive into whatever it is that you need to accomplish.

"
1762,12 may 2019,sagittarius,"Practicality meets adventure with a Moon-Venus trine. If you’ve wanted to try something new– a sport, hobby, lover (ahem), college course, travel destination–you’re in a great position to do so. Without doing anything stupid, I might add.

"
1763,14 may 2019,sagittarius,"If relationships with people have been bumpy, you definitely need to make an effort to smooth things over. Hot headed Mars is spending its last day in your commitment sector, but tomorrow it moves on to a more emotional place, the eighth house. Money, sex, intimacy, communication–the lack if it, or its quality–will all be brought to the fore. Unless you enjoy living in a soap opera, try to get things under control.

"
1764,15 may 2019,sagittarius,"Damn, you’re determined! Venus zips into your house of efficiency and red hot Mars blasts into the love, sex and money. You will be a force to be reckoned with, maybe too much of one. Don’t push too hard and alienate people you love and want on your side.

"
1765,16 may 2019,sagittarius,"“You either need to lead, follow or get out of the way.” This old phrase is a bit harsh but it gets the point across. And this is the kind of mood that you’re going to be in over the next week. You’re more than ready to do your share; are other people willing as well? If not, tell them to get in line.

"
1766,17 may 2019,sagittarius,"Jupiter, the planet of healing, is retrograde…in your house of healing! So in other words, you need to pay close attention to your body and the signals it’s sending out. Ignoring things isn’t going to make you feel better or enjoy a more fit physique. Start by making a few small changes to your routines and diet, and let them snowball into something positive.

"
1767,18 may 2019,sagittarius,"If you feel as though you are completely DONE with something (or someone), there’s a good reason for that. It’s called the full moon in your house of closure, which happens tonight. This annual event lets you chuck what’s not working and move on. You might want to start with yourself, though: planets in your house of habits are recommending changes, the kind you know  need to be made.

"
1768,19 may 2019,sagittarius,"You most definitely need to stick to a budget, Sagittarius. I don’t care how massive the blowout sale is, or the good deal you’re getting on something. With Pluto and Saturn both retrograde in your house of earning and saving cash, you need to be squirreling the green stuff away.

"
1769,20 may 2019,sagittarius,"Your optimism rises as the Moon lines up perfectly with abundant Jupiter in Sagittarius. You’ll be in such a good state of mind that you won’t be bothered with distracting people and situations. If people try to butt in, politely tell them you’re busy….dreaming up your next adventure!

"
1770,21 may 2019,sagittarius,"Yum! Cosmic energy starts to build in your commitment sector. The Sun and Mercury have just glided into your seventh house of serious love, beneficial for all of you, single or attached. Single archers could meet the love of their lives over the next month. Lines of communication open for those of you already involved in a relationship. Thinking about moving on to a better companion? That can happen too!

"
1771,22 may 2019,sagittarius,"Take a page from the dwarf playbook (you know, Snow White and the Seven freakin’ Dwarves?): “whistle while you work.” Seriously, a terrific Uranus-Mars aspect enables you to put a smile on your face while you pursue even the most mundane tasks. Or as the Navy SEALs would say, “embrace the suck.”

"
1772,23 may 2019,sagittarius,"It’s not your destiny in life to tolerate bad emotions, whether they come from you or somebody else. So if you’re the one with the problem, than you need to have a serious chat with yourself about why you’re feeling the way that you do. In your defense, aggressive Mars is currently in one of the most emo parts of your chart. This can stir the pot but it can also point out areas that you should address.

"
1773,24 may 2019,sagittarius,"Easy does it, Sagittarius! A tense Venus-Moon square indicates that you need to watch your tongue (and what you put in writing too). The problem is that people around you may be slacking off, and you won’t take to it very kindly. Or they may be hitting you with guilt and poor-little-me routines. Walk away. Tomorrow is a much better time to set them straight diplomatically.

"
1774,25 may 2019,sagittarius,"Jupiter is retrograde in your sign, sometimes making you wonder if your thinking is on target. The past few days have been confusing, to be sure. But a helpful Moon-Jupiter aspect brings clarity and the ability to express yourself well.

"
1775,26 may 2019,sagittarius,"When the Sun is in your opposite sign, as it is now, it can bring out either conflict or cooperation. Today the Sun forms a good aspect with Chiron, asking you to examine your closest relationships. Is there too much drama and stress? And are you contributing to it? Be honest with yourself.

"
1776,27 may 2019,sagittarius,"Your sign is famous for taking the longer view. But in reality, even archers go through times when they can’t see the forest for the trees. An illuminating lunar aspect helps you go up to the summit of the proverbial mountaintop and regain clarity. You’ll be out of the forest and up in the clouds.

"
1777,28 may 2019,sagittarius,"You may experience a sense of discomfort today, as if you’re not sure if you’re heading in right direction. But it’s really due to Jupiter being retrograde in your sign. The gas giant is making you a lot more philosophical, forcing you to reconsider your assumptions and plans.

"
1778,29 may 2019,sagittarius,"It’s your life and you need to live it your way, Sagittarius. This is true even if you’re in a serious romantic relationship, or you’re close to your family. Their expectations could get thrown in your face today. Try to be as diplomatic as possible and let them know that you make your own decisions.

"
1779,30 may 2019,sagittarius,"Archers are famous for being the one of the most independent signs of the zodiac. You’re not big on listening to someone else’s advice. However, a Mercury-Jupiter opposition recommends that you pay attention to what a trusted mentor or advisor has to say. This could be someone you know in real life, or a sage who has written a book or taped a podcast. Don’t be too proud to admit that you need to learn more.

"
1780,31 may 2019,sagittarius,"Sometimes love takes us to a place that’s full of rainbows and unicorns, where we put someone on a pedestal and we just can’t really see what’s going on. Then at other times we can see reality in the cold, grey light of dawn. But today a happy medium exists when you can be flirty and dreamy, yet down to Earth at the same time. It’s all about listening to your head AND your heart.

"
1781,1 june 2019,sagittarius,"Better health, glowing skin and more energy can be yours if you’re willing to make a few small changes. A productive Venus-Jupiter aspect encourages you to simply change a habit here, a habit there. With serious Saturn and transformative Pluto in your house of ritual, you’ll be able to stick with it.

"
1782,2 june 2019,sagittarius,"Old habits die hard, so they say. But you’re in a good position to create new habits and routines that will serve you well. With Jupiter retrograding through your sign you’re starting to realize what needs to change. You might want to start with your personal relationships, as a new moon occurs in that house tomorrow.

"
1783,3 june 2019,sagittarius,"A productive new Moon helps you to create more balanced relationships in both your personal and professional lives. Don’t be afraid to talk about roles and responsibilities with other people. Otherwise you’re going to get stuck holding the bag, which will only result in resentment. This is especially true with family members: they need to do their share.

"
1784,4 june 2019,sagittarius,"Recently red hot Mars has been tearing through your house of net worth, sex and intimacy. As a result you may have been tearing through cash, and there could’ve been plenty of drama in your love life. Fortunately, logical Mercury arrives on the scene today, tempering Mars’s aggression. Over the next three weeks you can gain a firmer handle on your emotions and money flow.

"
1785,5 june 2019,sagittarius,"You’re known for keeping calm but that could be tough today. Aggressive Mars meets up with the passionate Moon in the most emotional part of your chart. Jealousy, obsession, anger, drama….yuk, all of these could get stirred up. Tomorrow is a complete change as people may actually want to be cooperative. Wait until then and don’t lose your cool.

"
1786,6 june 2019,sagittarius,"Unless you want to deal with a lot of cranky people, make sure to play nice with others today. With magnetic Venus in the most cooperative part of your chart, you might discover that being diplomatic brings you unexpected rewards.

"
1787,7 june 2019,sagittarius,"Your ability to see things through to the end is going to pay off, archer. High octane Uranus gives you the one final burst of energy that’s needed to finish something up. Other people may be in a bit of a shock that you’re able to do this, but hey–you’re the one with the bow and arrow and that killer bullseye shot.

"
1788,11 june 2019,sagittarius,"If someone wants to give you advice you’d be wise to take it. Happy-go-lucky Jupiter is in your sign and it’s in a wonky mood, preventing you from seeing things clearly. Don’t be too proud to listen to what other people have to say. You’re not the only person on the planet with some brains.

"
1789,12 june 2019,sagittarius,"With so much planetary activity in the most passionate part of your chart, you could easily be roused in some way, shape or form! Whether you are filled with joy or angry as all hell is up to you. You’re starting to realize that you don’t have to have certain emotions. This is called personal growth, and you’re ready for it.

"
1790,13 june 2019,sagittarius,"Try to take a more balanced approach when it comes to handling people who are close to you. Forcing your opinions, habits and agendas on them will backfire. You may feel as though you know best (and you probably do!) but let others think that they’re making their own decisions.

"
1791,14 june 2019,sagittarius,"Start becoming more serious about saving and investing money, archer. It may not be the topic that excites you the most. But you need to develop a stronger financial foundation. The peace of mind that you’ll experience will be worth it.

"
1792,15 june 2019,sagittarius,"Your subconscious mind may be bubbling away like a heated cauldron, but that’s OK. It’s due to mental Mercury stirring things up. All sorts of memories and emotions could come to the surface—just let them go, like steam heading up to the clouds. You don’t need them anymore.

"
1793,16 june 2019,sagittarius,"Tomorrow brings a full moon in your sign, and today it’s all about emotional healing. If there are things that you need to get out in the open, now is the time to do so. People need to hear what’s on your mind. Meditation, mindfulness and journaling are also recommended.

"
1794,17 june 2019,sagittarius,"Yassss!!!!! The annual full moon in Sagittarius occurs tonight, and it spotlights your fondest wishes. Something that may have started around the time of your birthday could come to a conclusion. You may have to stick to your guns, though, as people try to get you to do things their way. That’s not their decision to make.

"
1795,18 june 2019,sagittarius,"You want life to become more settled, with less drama. Fortunately a helpful Saturn-Neptune aspect allows you to do just that. Things won’t happen overnight but you have to start somewhere.

"
1796,19 june 2019,sagittarius,"Your head and your heart could be at battle due to a Mars-Pluto face-off. Emotions might be rising really high, on your part and that of others. Don’t say or do anything that you might regret. If money is at stake you need to be extra vigilant.

"
1797,20 june 2019,sagittarius,"Things could change quickly at the office today, so you need to be flexible. It’s also possible that your personal schedule has to be switched up without much notice. Leave yourself enough time to get errands done.

"
1798,21 june 2019,sagittarius,"How comfortable do you feel in your own skin, archer? Two major planetary moves will help you reach a greater sense of contentment. The Sun enters your Cancer, your eighth house of deep feelings. Then Neptune begins to retrograde in your house of home and family, which deals with childhood programming and all of the other dramas that took place back then. It’s time to release mental junk.

"
1799,23 june 2019,sagittarius,"With happy-go-lucky Jupiter in your sign, you’re open to just about anything. But other people in your world may not be on board, as they can’t see the benefits or the common sense in what you’re saying. The good news is that this is a temporary situation. By midweek you’ll be able to inspire them to think differently.

"
1800,24 june 2019,sagittarius,"You can’t please everyone, Sagittarius, so don’t even try. People may use guilt or fear to try to get their way, but don’t fall into this trap. With Mercury about to enter the most adventurous, free-spirited part of your chart, you can’t afford to be tied down by other people’s expectations.

"
1801,25 june 2019,sagittarius,"You may not be feeling like the life of the party today, but there is a reason for it. Chiron, the wounded healer, is making you question some of your choices in life. Don’t worry, this won’t last long. Tomorrow you’ll be back to your usual audacious self.

"
1802,26 june 2019,sagittarius,"You may not be feeling like the life of the party today, but there is a reason for it. Chiron, the wounded healer, is making you question some of your choices in life. Don’t worry, this won’t last long. Tomorrow you’ll be back to your usual audacious self.

"
1803,28 june 2019,sagittarius,"Somebody has to be the grownup today and it might as well be you. Seriously, you may have to take over and get things done as others won’t be able or willing to. But you’ll end up with greater peace of mind knowing that it was done right.

"
1804,29 june 2019,sagittarius,"Taking a chill pill? With logical Mercury in the most visionary part of your chart, you’re able to see things for the way they really are. This will enable you to relax a bit instead of getting stressed out. Mental clarity is a beautiful thing!

"
1805,30 june 2019,sagittarius,"People may try to clip your wings and chances are you’ll resent it! But there could be some value and common sense to what they’re saying. Don’t be too proud to consider someone else’s point of view.

"
1806,1 july 2019,sagittarius,"You should be happier than a pig in mud! Lively, assertive Mars enters your house of taking chances and living bolder. Since you’re the most daring sign of the zodiac, this is a match made in the heavens. Make sure, though, that you don’t go broke in the process. This week’s solar eclipse occurs in your house of building net worth.

"
1807,2 july 2019,sagittarius,"Creating a strong foundation in your life is the message from the cosmos, archer. This may mean playing by the rules….or perhaps breaking them! It’s up to you to determine which way to go. If breaking out of an old situation actually creates greater strength, then so be it.

"
1808,3 july 2019,sagittarius,"It’s time to get serious about the long term, archer. You can no longer afford to wing it when it comes to your finances or love life. That’s the message behind today’s solar eclipse, an event that will have far reaching effects. Emotions and dramas need to be set aside so that you can get crystal clear about the path ahead.

"
1809,4 july 2019,sagittarius,"Abundant Jupiter is in your sign and it’s suggesting some kind of fun family event in the near future. This could be a vacation, reunion or barbecue. And if hanging out with the family unit is not your idea of a good time, the Leo Moon recommends a get together with the tribe and your lover. So there.

"
1810,5 july 2019,sagittarius,"Abundant Jupiter is in your sign and it’s suggesting some kind of fun family event in the near future. This could be a vacation, reunion or barbecue. And if hanging out with the family unit is not your idea of a good time, the Leo Moon recommends a get together with the tribe and your lover. So there.

"
1811,6 july 2019,sagittarius,"Should you play by the rules…or break them, if just a teensy bit? That’s the question the cosmos asks you this weekend. Actually, you’ll be pondering this question over the next two weeks. Don’t surprised if your mind is going off in tangents, because you really do need to sort this out.

"
1812,7 july 2019,sagittarius,"Big plans need to go back to the drawing board, archer. Mercury begins to retrograde in your high flying ninth house. This is where you can conceive ideas that are audacious, which is a beautiful thing—as long as they are well planned. This could be anything from graduate school to a world tour to forming your own startup. Slow your roll.

"
1813,8 july 2019,sagittarius,"You could be suddenly motivated to take better care of your health, both physical and mental. This is worth spending money on by the way, as Venus (one of the planets that governs cash flow) is in a good angle. You may not need a celebrity physical trainer or a $5000 wellness retreat, but investing in yourself is important.

"
1814,9 july 2019,sagittarius,"Flying all over the place emotionally just isn’t going to cut it, archer. A stern Sun-Saturn opposition demands that you operate with a calm, cool detachment. If you’ve been dealing with emotional issues to the point where they’re interfering with your happiness and ability to get through the day, then you need to either seek help or commit to doing a lot of inner work.

"
1815,10 july 2019,sagittarius,"Your heart is bigger than the cosmos thanks to a glorious Sun-Neptune trine. So reach out to people who could use a bit of comfort and advice. While you’re at it, be sure to treat yourself well too. Your mind and soul could use some TLC.

"
1816,11 july 2019,sagittarius,"Just when you thought you had everything under control….screwball Uranus throws a monkey wrench into the works. Unexpected delays and problems could crop up in just about any area of your life. Hothead Mars could prompt you to lose your cool. Don’t go there, because tomorrow the Moon glides into Sagittarius and you’ll be on firmer ground.

"
1817,12 july 2019,sagittarius,"The Moon is in your sign and you are up for just about any kind of adventure. This is a great attitude to have, because Lady Luck (aka Jupiter) has your back. The events of this weekend could have some interesting ramifications in the months to come.

"
1818,13 july 2019,sagittarius,"Oooh, yeah. The Moon is in Sagittarius and it meets up with happy-go-lucky Jupiter. Which means that the cosmos gives you its permission to do whatever the heck you feel like doing (as long as it’s legal). Enjoy!

"
1819,14 july 2019,sagittarius,"Everyone likes feeling as though they are in control of their life. With power broker Pluto in your house of stability, chances are you’re experiencing this more intensely than the other signs. The problem is that you may become so agitated about it that you start making ultimatums or lose your temper. Chill out, as you might annoy someone whose help you need.

"
1820,15 july 2019,sagittarius,"If your line of work isn’t making you the happiest camper on planet Earth, then it may be time for a change– a BIG one. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in your income sector could make you do a 180. So take some time today to consider what you’d like to do next, as the passionate Moon lines up perfectly with Saturn, planet of long term success, and Pluto, the planet of personal power.

"
1821,16 july 2019,sagittarius,"Yasss!!! A lunar eclipse occurs in your cash sector, helping you core more dinero. You could get a new job or a raise. Maybe you’ll land a client with deep pockets, or come up with a winning idea for a business. One door closes and another opens—that’s how eclipses roll. Just don’t expect overnight wealth, an issue with this lunation. Slow and steady will win the race.

"
1822,17 july 2019,sagittarius,"Risky business? Today’s Venus-Saturn opposition means that it’s not a good time to take ridiculous chances in any part of your life. On the flip side, demanding guarantees or answers from people won’t work either. Just go with the flow, because by tomorrow the cosmic energy shifts in your favor.

"
1823,18 july 2019,sagittarius,"Aahhh. Your thoughts and emotions balance out, thanks to a peaceful Venus-Neptune trine. If you need to talk things over with someone close, do so. Otherwise just do some much needed inner work, like meditating or taking a walk in nature.

"
1824,19 july 2019,sagittarius,"Your emotions may get stirred up as Mercury retrogrades into one of the most psychological parts of your chart. Love, sex and money (all hot topics) could be the focus. Issues that cropped up a few months ago could be back on the table, needing to be resolved. The retrograde period ends on the 31st, so use it to put things to rest.

"
1825,20 july 2019,sagittarius,"Someone could be quite forceful, demanding answers or some kind of commitment from you. Or  you could be the one who is on the warpath. Take it easy there, archer. This approach could quickly backfire due to a Venus-Pluto opposition. Tomorrow is a much better day for communicating and compromising, so wait until then.

"
1826,21 july 2019,sagittarius,"Phew. Logical thinking can be applied to emotional, romantic and financial matters. That’s because level headed Mercury meets up with the Sun, helping you cut out drama and feelings and deal with things head on. Mercury is retrograde, so issues from the past could return, but this is a good opportunity to lay them to rest.

"
1827,22 july 2019,sagittarius,"Is it time to redecorate your place? If you read yesterday’s horoscope you know that now is an important time to create more contentment and serenity in your life. Why not start be treating a peaceful haven at home?

"
1828,23 july 2019,sagittarius,"Things might be going so well that you’re getting a little suspicious. Chill out, archer—nothing bad is about to happen! It’s just that people are noticing your creativity and artistic talent. A lover (or a wannabe) is also impressed with your charismatic ways, so enjoy it already.

"
1829,24 july 2019,sagittarius,"It’s better to err on the side of caution and tell it as it is today. Concealing information or tap dancing around issues could backfire. This is just as true in love and family issues as it is in business. The truth will set you free and everyone else, for that matter.

"
1830,25 july 2019,sagittarius,"Don’t be surprised if you feel unstoppable! With lucky Jupiter active in your sign, and high octane Mars tearing through your house of adventure, you are  a force of nature. The only problem you may be dealing with right now is figuring out which audacious undertaking to pursue first. Things are only going to become more intense when Venus enters this part of your chart on Saturday!

"
1831,26 july 2019,sagittarius,"Now that the Sun is in the most high flying part of your chart, you should be ready to take on some exciting new challenges. But a Mars-Saturn link warns that (a) some of these grand plans may cost money and (b) you can’t be going all over the place. Chasing after every “shiny object” is a surefire way to end up with nothing. So be selective and pursue     the one thing that matters most.

"
1832,27 july 2019,sagittarius,"Life is too short to be romantically involved with someone who is a colossal bore. That’s the message from the cosmos as amorous Venus glides into your house of adventure! And if you’re in a relationship that has lost some of its spark, it’s time to reignite that flame. You have no excuses, babe: the sizzling Sun, lusty Mars and charismatic Venus are all in this house. Ggrrrr.

"
1833,28 july 2019,sagittarius,"Your idea of what’s fun and interesting may be changing, archer. So don’t be surprised if you find that you’re getting bored with certain situations (and maybe even people!). The planets are urging you to live a bolder lifestyle and as a result you’re recognizing “limiting factors.”

"
1834,29 july 2019,sagittarius,"“Playing by the rules? That’s for wimps!” If anyone displays this attitude today, head in the opposite direction. And if you’re the one who’s thinking this way, it’s time for an attitude adjustment. Hey, no one is telling you to hide in the shadows. On the contrary, the cosmos is pushing you to take some new chances. But you still have to do things sensibly as you push those boundaries.

"
1835,31 july 2019,sagittarius,"“Aahhh. Not feeling so emo anymore.” If that’s the way you feel, here’s why: Mercury is now direct in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. Over the past few weeks you may have felt as though everyone was pushing your buttons. Maybe they were, maybe they weren’t; but perception is everything, as we know. Life becomes a lot more carefree tomorrow thanks to the Leo new moon.

1930,23 march 2019,capricorn,"

1931,24 march 2019,capricorn,"

"
1932,25 march 2019,capricorn,"
People may try to push your buttons, but they won’t get far! You are becoming a lot more interested in protecting your peace of mind, which is a good thing. You’re not going to give your power away to trolls.

"
1933,27 march 2019,capricorn,"You’re perfect just the way you are, so don’t try to fit in with someone else’s expectations. As a matter of fact, you should even consider living a bit more flamboyantly! Rebellious Uranus is having some fun in your creativity sector, so don’t be afraid to cut loose.

"
1934,31 march 2019,capricorn,"Get your life in order, Capricorn. Everyone assumes that you are so efficient, but you know better. You have your sloppy moments just like everyone else. But there are no more excuses, thanks to energetic Mars rolling into your house of productivity today. Use this energy over the next two months to get your home and office lives pulled together. This is also the best time in 2019 just start a diet and fitness regimen.

"
1935,7 april 2019,capricorn,"Obstacles? What the hell are they? That’s always been your motto and nothing has changed! You’ve been out of sorts lately but planetary aspects put you back in a determined groove today. The week ahead is thoughtful, so don’t be surprised if you’re pulling away and doing some serious strategizing.

"
1936,8 april 2019,capricorn,"Anyone who thinks that you don’t know how to pour on the charm is in for a big surprise! You certainly can, and this week you’ll be able to dazzle people. Today the moon is in your house of flirting and having fun. Get in touch with your playful, romantic side.

"
1937,9 april 2019,capricorn,"You’re going through a lot of psychological changes, Capricorn. You may not even realize just how stressful this has been. So if you feel a little bit uncomfortable in your own skin, there’s a reason for it. Fortunately, tomorrow mighty Jupiter starts to retrograde in the house of the subconscious mind. Amazing healing and cleansing can occur over the next four months.

"
1938,10 april 2019,capricorn,"Go within, Capricorn. There are riches in your subconscious mind that you haven’t begun to tap in to. Now that Jupiter is retrograde in the house of intuition and cosmic wisdom, you should pull away from the world a bit and discover hidden truths.

"
1939,11 april 2019,capricorn,"Honey, you could charm the birds from the trees right now! A fabulous meeting between Venus and Neptune in your communications sector puts just the right words in your mouth. So go out there and dazzle everyone already!

"
1940,12 april 2019,capricorn,"Keep a low profile today, Capricorn. Play dumb if you have to. Say little and reveal less. Has anyone entrusted a secret with you? Make sure you keep it confidential. A Jupiter-Mercury square warns that you could reveal too much intel otherwise.

"
1941,13 april 2019,capricorn,"Inner contentment is desired by everyone, but it can be quite elusive. And in your case, it may feel like an impossible dream. Dig deep into your heart and psyche to find out what’s troubling you. You can  get past this if you try.

"
1942,14 april 2019,capricorn,"Do as you please today….for once! Your tired brain needs a break from thinking all the time. The upside is that if you just chill out a little bit, that you will begin to transform. It’s time to morph from your cocoon.

"
1943,15 april 2019,capricorn,"Your intuition may be a bit off today, so don’t rely on gut feelings. Nor should you listen to what others have to say! As the week progresses, things become more clear. The full moon on Friday is a winner for making key decisions.

"
1944,16 april 2019,capricorn,"Hope you have your BS meter turned on. Put on the hip boots too. It could get pretty deep today as people are saying things that have no basis in reality. You can choose to get annoyed about this, or to ignore it and move on. Chances are you’ll ignore it. The upcoming full moon is in your house of ambition, and you’ve got bigger fish to fry.

"
1945,17 april 2019,capricorn,"You are going to have to strike a balance over the next few weeks between your home and career lives. Even if you’re single and you don’t have to worry too much about other people, you definitely need some downtime for yourself. Life is too short to constantly be working and stressing out.

"
1946,18 april 2019,capricorn,"From your chart it’s obvious that your values don’t mesh with those of other people…..which means that you could be in the wrong job, romance or friendships. Don’t get upset this; get real. Then find the people and situations that are right for you.

"
1947,19 april 2019,capricorn,"You are entering an incredibly creative period, one which could transform your life for the better. Your home, hobbies, appearance and career can all be amped up.

And Venus is now in your domestic sector of home and family. Your focus will switch from work-work-work to spending more relaxed quality time with the ones you love…and that includes you!

"
1949,21 april 2019,capricorn,"Inner peace shouldn’t be something that you achieve “someday”. It’s a moment by moment thing. A wonderful Moon-Venus aspect helps you dig deep into a well of contentment and become more serene.

"
1950,22 april 2019,capricorn,"Ready to shake things up in your image, love life and career? The cosmos has your back, Capricorn!

"
1951,23 april 2019,capricorn,"You could experience a mental or emotional release today, something that will soothe your soul. This is a good thing, because you’ve been wound up pretty tight lately. It’s a good time to pick up a healthy new mental practice, such as mindfulness or journaling.

"
1952,24 april 2019,capricorn,"Here come the retrogrades! Pluto starts to spin backward today in Capricorn, encouraging you to dig deep into your psyche. Everything in your life is up for review over the next few months: love, career, health, friendships, travel plans, where you live, hobbies, you name it. Pluto loves doing research and is hell bent on getting to the bottom of things. As a result, your plans and ideas could go through profound changes.

"
1953,25 april 2019,capricorn,"A vibey lunar aspect helps you feel so much more comfortable in your own skin, Capricorn. For months now you may have felt awkward or as though you’re not living an authentic life. That’s going to change, and it begins now. A greater sense of contentment and certainty is coming your way.

"
1954,26 april 2019,capricorn,"Jealousy or childish behavior could erupt, and hopefully it’s not coming from you. Steer clear of known divas and whiners and keep your precious chi  in balance. With Pluto now retrograde in your sign, you’ve got bigger things to worry about: primarily you!

"
1955,27 april 2019,capricorn,"Mars, the most motivated planet of them all, is stationed in your let’s-get-things done sector, the sixth house of efficiency. The red planet likes being here because hell, sh** has to happen! But as much as you may want to hustle, it appears that you need more details or a better plan. Slow down and take your time.

"
1956,28 april 2019,capricorn,"Sometimes dealing with other people just seems like way too much, and today could be one of those times. There’s nothing wrong with carving out some quiet time for yourself. You have a busy few months ahead, Capricorn….it’s imperative that you recharge your batteries from time to time.

"
1957,29 april 2019,capricorn,"A huge chapter in your life opens up today, Capricorn. It may not seem that way at first but when you look back later in the year, you will realize that late April was a game changer. That’s because Saturn, your ruler, retrogrades in your sign. Pluto started swimming backward here last week. In the months ahead you will change in ways that you can’t even conceive right now.

"
1958,30 april 2019,capricorn,"“Why can’t everyone be as pulled together and efficient as I am?”  That may be your battle cry today as offbeat Neptune makes everyone around you slack off and make excuses. Well, you know what they say: when the going gets tough, the tough get going.

"
1959,1 may 2019,capricorn,"One of the smartest things you can do this week is to get your home base all squared away. Said Carson Kressly (Queer Eye for the Straight Guy), “as long as my checkbook is balanced and my clothes are ironed I feel like I have some control over my life.” So clean up messes, get caught up on errands and live a less stressed life.

"
1960,2 may 2019,capricorn,"For some odd reason you may feel a bit out of place. Chances are it’s old programming from childhood, and it needs to go. You’re an adult and what goes on in your mind is entirely your choice. Choose positivity.

"
1961,3 may 2019,capricorn,"What a wonderful day for emotional healing! A cathartic Mercury-Jupiter trine allows you to be rational and clear sighted about what your issues are (and we all have some). Then you can find a way to handle them. Abundant Jupiter is in your house of psychology, so mindfulness and meditating are both good practices to start.

"
1962,4 may 2019,capricorn,"Sweet! The new moon occurs in your house of love. This lunation sets the stage for meeting someone new or solidifying an existing romance. Your talent and creativity also happen to be in this sector, so be prepared to watch your skill set grow.

"
1963,5 may 2019,capricorn,"Been burning the candle at both ends? It sure looks that way from your chart. You have to stop pushing yourself so hard, Capricorn. You also need to stop kidding yourself about nagging physical and emotional issues. It’s time for some extreme self care.

"
1964,7 may 2019,capricorn,"Someone may try to use guilt or flattery to get their way with you. Fortunately, you’re not that stupid! And with mature Saturn in your sign, you’ll just let this go. This energy reappears on Thursday, so expect it to continue at least for a while.

"
1965,8 may 2019,capricorn,"Sweet surprise! Unpredictability is Uranus’s domain, and today the blue planet forms a perfect line with lively Mercury. They meet in your house of fun and romance, a nice bonus. It’s a great day to do something spontaneous with your honey. Single sea goats could meet someone in a crazy way, which will be a story you can tell later on. Creative projects also get a huge boost.

"
1966,10 may 2019,capricorn,"Metamorphic Pluto is retrograding through your sign, which is going to make you reflect upon how you’re living your life. From your chart it’s clear that old patterns have to go, especially old ones from childhood. So do sorrow, fear and regrets. Sayonara, baby.

"
1967,11 may 2019,capricorn,"You’re becoming more disciplined lately (is that even possible for a Capricorn?) but ya still gotta have some fun. And a Sun-Saturn aspect is telling you to lighten up and book some play time. This energy runs all the way into next weekend, so stop being such a saint.

"
1968,12 may 2019,capricorn,"You need to feel comfortable with what you’re doing and where you’re heading. If not, then take some time to reconsider your values and plans. With Pluto and Saturn both retrograde in your sign, there’s going to be a lot of reflection in the months ahead. Might as well start now.

"
1969,13 may 2019,capricorn,"Metamorphic Pluto is suggesting that you make a few changes to your image, sea goat. This could be anything from your hair and wardrobe to your attitude and way of speaking. Don’t be afraid to sign up for classes that help you speak more confidently in front of groups, or the kind that polish up your manners. You’re going places are your image needs to reflect that.

"
1970,14 may 2019,capricorn,"You can start to slow down and relax a bit, Capricorn. Aggressive Mars is getting ready to leave your house of productivity. No doubt you’ve been pushing hard; give it one more blast of energy. Then get ready for some fun in the weeks ahead.

"
1971,15 may 2019,capricorn,"In the mood for love? I sure hope so! Even if you’re not, the cosmos will drag you kicking and screaming into a romantic place. That’s because (a) amorous Venus enters your house of love today and (b) red hot Mars enters the commitment zone. You’re the envy of the zodiac, Capricorn! This is one heck of a coincidence. This is also an excellent situation for simply having more fun and being creative.

"
1972,16 may 2019,capricorn,"Crafting a message is always important. Whether you need to get through to your kids, a lover, colleagues or the world stage, you need to have a strong message. You need to be coming from a place of authority, but you can’t keep delivering the same old boring message either. Today is a smart time to figure out a better way to communicate.

"
1973,17 may 2019,capricorn,"Not everything that you think and do should be out there for consumption. With Mercury in your house of living more creatively, you should be thinking about updating your self image and lifestyle. Just do it quietly. Pretend like you’re on one of those reality shows with the Big Reveal at the end!

"
1974,18 may 2019,capricorn,"It’s time to be selective about who’s going to remain in your inner circle. The full moon in your house of friends and acquaintances demands that you surround yourself with only the very best kind of people. And unpredictable Uranus sparkles in your house of romance, indicating that something surprising and juicy could happen in love.

"
1975,19 may 2019,capricorn,"As time goes on we start to act, dress and think in ways that other  people expect us to. And sometimes we get tired of our “persona”, desiring to change it. There is no magical way to do this; it won’t happen overnight. It’s a day by day process. With Pluto and Saturn shaking up your self-image sector, though, you can pull this off over the next few months. Patience.

"
1976,20 may 2019,capricorn,"Sometimes you just have to go with what your gut is telling you and disregard logic. Today is one of those days, Capricorn. But keep your opinions and intuitive observations to yourself. Don’t let others know that you’ve got everything figured out!

"
1977,21 may 2019,capricorn,"Nobody had better get in your way, Capricorn! With the determined Sun AND strategic Mercury entering your sixth house of efficiency, you are going to become a force of nature. It’s kind of like New Year’s Eve in May. You want to knock things off your list of things to do, things that will make your life a lot better.

"
1978,22 may 2019,capricorn,"A terrific spurt of creativity and optimism hits you, and this will be contagious. Don’t be surprised to find that you’re attracting like minded people your way. Like moths to a flame they’re going to be pulled in by your can-do attitude. But hey, you always  had that can-do attitude. Finally other people are waking up to that reality.

"
1979,23 may 2019,capricorn,"Playing by the rules isn’t looking so appetizing, Capricorn. People may try to hem you in but you won’t have any of it. They could also use guilt, which also won’t work. Yeah, you’re a rugged individualist. So what?

"
1980,24 may 2019,capricorn,"Steer clear of people and pastimes that threaten to throw you off track, Capricorn. Yes, the weekend is here and you deserve to have fun. But you need to stay true to your values and your vision.

"
1981,25 may 2019,capricorn,"You know what you need to do, so why aren’t you doing it? The smartest thing you can do today is to go within. Meditate. Journal. Be real and honest with yourself. Answers will come, and you’ll set out on the right path.

"
1982,26 may 2019,capricorn,"From your chart it appears that you’re feeling guilty for no reason, Capricorn. You don’t owe anyone anything. This includes your job, a relationship or a team that you’re part of. The problem is that you are such a hard worker that you’re taking too much of the responsibility. Just do your own share and forget the rest.

"
1983,27 may 2019,capricorn,"Other people may have been challenging you lately, and naturally this can be frustrating. This isn’t over; you could witness more of this nonsense on Wednesday. But you’re starting to realize that it’s not worth it to get engaged in their dramas. It’s not your karma to be someone else’s doormat.

"
1984,28 may 2019,capricorn,"You may be waiting to hear news about something before you proceed. Or perhaps you’re waiting for certain events to occur. In the meantime, your subconscious mind will stir up all sorts of wonky thoughts! That’s because the moon squares Jupiter today. Face it: you don’t have all the facts and you’re just going to have to wait. For now, give your tired brain a rest.

"
1985,29 may 2019,capricorn,"Your thoughts could be all jumbled up as your brain has way  too much going on inside. From your chart it appears that you’re trying to sort something out, and the right solution hasn’t presented itself yet. But like a dog with a bone, you won’t let go. Relax there, Fido. Inspiration and clarity start to return tomorrow.

"
1986,30 may 2019,capricorn,"Don’t be afraid to “pull back the curtain” and see what lies behind it. Remember in The Wizard of Oz  when Dorothy is told “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain”? Honey, you DO need to find out what’s going on behind the scenes rather than ignoring it. Be discreet about it, but do it.

"
1987,31 may 2019,capricorn,"The cosmos has just one demand of you this weekend, Capricorn: for heaven’s sakes, get out there and have some fun already! A sparkling Venus-Neptune trine suggests a short trip out of town, taking in a concert or brunching with the tribe. You need to cut loose and relax.

"
1988,1 june 2019,capricorn,"There’s a side to you that many people don’t see. Maybe it’s because you’re not in touch with it enough! It’s a fun, frisky persona. Sultry even. Colorful and creative too. A Venus-Jupiter aspect helps you bring that side out you out, even just a little bit. But like a snowball running downhill, it develops momentum.

"
1989,2 june 2019,capricorn,"Metamorphosis…..you’re going through it in a big way, whether you realize it or not. A terrific Venus-Pluto trine encourages you to become someone maybe not new, but more authentically “you”. Life is not a dress rehearsal. Don’t wait another day to let that side of you come out!

"
1990,3 june 2019,capricorn,"First the good news: today’s new moon occurs in the most organized, efficient part of your chart. You’ll be able to cut through tasks like a hot knife through a cold stick of butter. The problem is, where to start? You may be so backed up at home and at the office that you don’t even know where to begin. Here’s a corny saying that might help: “By the yard, it’s hard, by the inch it’s a cinch.” Just pick one area and dig in, little by little.

"
1991,4 june 2019,capricorn,"Relationships with other people should start to calm down now that levelheaded Mercury is in your house of partnering. Diplomacy and cooperation are going to count for a lot over the next month. You don’t always have to be in charge, even if you are the smartest person in the room!

"
1992,5 june 2019,capricorn,"Things could get testy within a close personal or business relationship. Blabbermouth Mars is in an emotional mood and may not be thinking rationally. Be careful with what you say and do, as it appears from your chart that you will be working with people closely over the next few days. You’ll start feeling more cooperative when Venus changes signs on Saturday.

"
1993,6 june 2019,capricorn,"You need to be around people who “get” you, Capricorn. With Venus in Taurus your charisma will be high, so it won’t be hard to find people who are drawn to you. Be selective and choose new friends, coworkers and lovers who aren’t afraid of the authentic you.

"
1994,7 june 2019,capricorn,"This is no time to hide your talent from the world! Brilliant Uranus, the planet of genius, is active in your most creative sector. Be as assertive as you please. If you think that retaining the services of an expert will help you, go for it. I’m talking about a literary or booking agent, a manager, stylist or social media maven, for starters.

"
1995,11 june 2019,capricorn,"It’s time to get real about health issues, whether they’re the physical or the mental kind. Abundant Jupiter is making you think that you can take on the world—with very little sleep, lots of stress and no valve for letting things go. News flash: you are NOT a bottomless pit of vitality. Like a bank account that’s depleted, it needs to be topped off

"
1996,12 june 2019,capricorn,"You are under no obligation to do something that someone else is demanding. So don’t feel guilty about saying no. Let’s face it, you have enough on your plate already. You don’t need to do someone else’s job too.

"
1997,13 june 2019,capricorn,"You’re so used to charging ahead on your own grit and determination that sometimes you forget that a higher power has your back. Don’t be too proud to ask for help from the spirit world from time to time; they’d be happy to oblige.

"
1998,14 june 2019,capricorn,"You may not feel like cooperating, schmoozing or negotiating but (sigh) so you must. Face it, Capricorn, you can’t control everything, and that includes people. A little charm could go a long way for you right now.

"
1999,15 june 2019,capricorn,"It seems like you’re being too hard on yourself. Why? You’re only human. From your chart it appears that you’re holding yourself up to some kind of perfectionist ideal. Relax a little bit. Be good to yourself.

"
2000,16 june 2019,capricorn,"It’s time to buy the hatchet, Capricorn. Maybe you need to work things out with a family member, friend or lover. Perhaps it’s a co-worker who’s been driving you crazy. Heck, maybe you even need to let yourself off the hook! Life shouldn’t be a battle all the time.

"
2001,17 june 2019,capricorn,"Your sixth sense will go through the roof, thanks to the full moon in the most mysterious part of your chart. Good thing too, as this is the house of closure and transition. If there is a part of your life where you’d like to hit the delete key, now’s the time. When it comes to other people, pay attention to the energy they’re giving off and not what they’re saying.

"
2002,18 june 2019,capricorn,"There’s nothing wrong with being a little frivolous and light hearted. Nor is there anything wrong with chucking your responsibilities for awhile and just relaxing. Today is a good time for chilling out and letting other people hustle.

"
2003,19 june 2019,capricorn,"You will be in one hell of a domineering mood, but is it wise to act that way? People will be more than willing to fight back, so choose your battles wisely. Cooperation returns on Friday when the Sun enters Cancer.

"
2004,20 june 2019,capricorn,"You could do a complete 180 today, Capricorn! Maybe you’ll switch up your appearance. Or perhaps you’ll decide to enter a new line of work. Is your love life in the doldrums?  Then it’s time to add some juice to it. But don’t move too quickly. Make sure that stability is maintained in your life.

"
2005,21 june 2019,capricorn,"You’ll need to play nice and cooperate over the next few weeks, Capricorn. The Sun is own your partnering sector, shining its light on relationships with people in your world—-and the new ones you haven’t met yet. But at the same time, confusing Neptune starts to spin backward in your house of thinking and speaking. What you say and how you say it will become critical. Take the time to consider your words carefully.

"
2006,22 june 2019,capricorn,"Cut loose a little this weekend. The Moon is in the house of short distance travel, so if you can get out of town, go for it. If not, this sector governs partying too, and having adventures in your neighborhood. The only problem is which relaxing activities to choose!

"
2007,23 june 2019,capricorn,"Venus is in the house of habits and routines, telling you to get your act together. But Jupiter opposes it, saying, “Why bother? Everything is OK just the way it is!”  Uh, no it isn’t. Pay attention to Venus and start making some changes.

"
2008,24 june 2019,capricorn,"The need to be crystal clear is paramount today, Capricorn. If people don’t understand your meaning you will either (a) look foolish or (b) there will be problems down the road. This is just as true in your personal life as it is in your work environment. Keep things short and concise.

"
2009,25 june 2019,capricorn,"Inner peace as as valuable as enjoying good health, and right now you need to chill out. Chiron, the wounded healer, is urging you to toss out emotional baggage that no longer suits you. Once Mercury enters one of the most psychological parts of your chart tomorrow, you’ll have the opportunity to do some much needed inner work.

"
2010,26 june 2019,capricorn,"Just say “ohmmmm.” Mental Mercury enters Leo, your eighth house of emotional depth. The next few weeks are well aspected for getting your head on straight! Meditation, journaling, scheduling a psychic reading, talking to a therapist or close friend–do what it takes to feel better inside.

"
2011,28 june 2019,capricorn,"You should be feeling more assertive and in control as your ruler, Saturn, is in an excellent angle. But the ringed planet is also winking at the Moon, which is in the most fun-loving part of your chart. It’s a great day for balancing the playful and more ambitious parts of your personality.

"
2012,29 june 2019,capricorn,"Your emotions start to level off today, which is a good thing. For far too long you’ve been under stress, the kind that makes it hard to feel as though you’re in balance. Passion for life will start to return too, a wonderful gift from the cosmos.

"
2013,30 june 2019,capricorn,"With Jupiter retrograding through the most psychological part of your chart, you may feel as though you don’t have to do any inner work. “I’m OK the way I am” could be your attitude. Uh….I don’t think so. There’s nothing wrong in admitting that you need to get your act together in the mental department, Capricorn.

"
2014,1 july 2019,capricorn,"Your sign is considered to be one of the most traditional of the zodiac, but beneath that cool exterior lies a passionate heart and mind. Now’s a great time to release your inner rebel, even if just a bit! Red hot Mars enters your house of sex, intimacy, deep emotions and net worth. Start pursuing the things that make you happy.

"
2015,2 july 2019,capricorn,"It’s not your karma to put up with a lot of flak from people who don’t honor who you are, Capricorn. If you are done  with being treated a certain (unpleasant) way….and from your chart it appears to be the case….then it’s time for some changes. And conveniently, tomorrow’s solar eclipse helps you do just that.

"
2016,3 july 2019,capricorn,"There will be two eclipses in July, one in Capricorn and the other in Cancer. These will point out what you need to do to take care of your own needs, and what you will or will not accept from others. The solar eclipse today is in Cancer, and it will kick off a new period in which your relationships with others will change in a big way. Surround yourself only with people who support you; forget the rest.

"
2017,4 july 2019,capricorn,"A recurring theme for you this month is this: just how much guff do you want to take from other people? Two eclipses in July (one was yesterday) will make you reconsider your interactions with others. A Saturn-North Node opposition today might make you feel as though you’re stuck dealing with certain people and their behavior. Nope. There’s nothing wrong with setting boundaries, Capricorn.

"
2018,5 july 2019,capricorn,"You need to release feelings and ideas that have been building up inside, Capricorn. A helpful Jupiter-Neptune aspect recommends journaling, meditating or even therapy if you think you’d benefit from it. With a lunar eclipse arriving in your sign on the 16th, it’s time to close out anything that’s not working for you.

2019,6 july 2019,capricorn,"Don’t feel guilty if you feel like cutting loose and doing things that are more fun and adventurous. From your chart it’s clear that you need a break, so take one. And if this means cutting loose from people who are downers, so be it. You don’t need to end your relationships with them; just avoid them this weekend!

"
2020,7 july 2019,capricorn,"Your emotional state is the focus now that Mercury is retrograding through one of the most psychological parts of your chart. People have been riling you up lately, and you may have been losing your usual cool. How you deal with others is a big focus for the rest of the week. On the 16th there will be a lunar eclipse in your sign, at which time you’ll be making some big decisions about who stays and who goes.

"
2021,8 july 2019,capricorn,"Right now you’re not willing to settle for second best, and why should you? On the contrary, with spunky Uranus having fun in the most creative part of your chart, you’ll be dreaming up ways to make your life more colorful. Find people who have a zest for good living and join their ranks!

"
2022,9 july 2019,capricorn,"You know what you want and how to get it….so why are other people hellbent on you doing things their way? This is a theme that is going to crop up again between now and the time of the lunar eclipse in Capricorn on the 16th. It could turn into a full blown battle, if you let it. But is that worth your time and trouble?

"
2023,10 july 2019,capricorn,"You could charm the birds from the trees as inspired Neptune helps put just the right words in your mouth. You tend to tell it like it is but right now you should use a little sugar. This isn’t bullish**ing; it’s smart strategy!

"
2024,11 july 2019,capricorn,"Rebellious feelings may crop up, the kind that tell you to chuck it all and start over doing something else, something more enjoyable and creative. It’s not necessary to dump things or people though. Chances are you simply need more down time and to make your personal life more interesting.

"
2025,12 july 2019,capricorn,"Not everyone needs to know your private business, so keep a few things to yourself. The Moon is in the most secretive, mysterious part of your chart, so don’t be surprised if you feel like an agent provocateur.

"
2026,13 july 2019,capricorn,"You’ll do your best work alone this weekend, although this doesn’t mean that you have to hide! It’s just that your intuition is sharp and you’re better off listening to your own counsel rather than that of other people. Besides, you know your life better than anyone else.

"
2027,14 july 2019,capricorn,"A powerful lunar eclipse is getting ready to occur in your sign, and you should already be feeling it. Disciplined Saturn and subterranean Pluto are both retrograde in Capricorn, making you question the truly important things that matter the most. If anyone tries to tell you what to do, or how you should think, chances are their head will be handed back to them on a plate—by you!

"
2028,15 july 2019,capricorn,"You’re as serious as a heart attack, sea goat. With the Moon forming a perfect line with Pluto and Saturn, you mean business. You know what you want and damn skippy, you’re going to get it. Tomorrow is show time: the lunar eclipse is in your sign.

"
2029,16 july 2019,capricorn,"Yeah, baby! Out with the old and in with the new. No, it’s not New Year’s Eve—it’s a freakin’ lunar eclipse in Capricorn! Anything or anyone that is past its sell-by date can be unceremoniously tossed to the curb. Seriously, this is probably the best time in 2019 to let go of the past and embrace a sparkling new future. You’ve worked for it, and you deserve it.

"
2030,17 july 2019,capricorn,"Yesterday’s lunar eclipse in your sign has brought a much needed sense of finality. You are more than ready to close out old chapters of your life and start new ones. Healing Jupiter is hard at work in the subconscious mind sector, helping you to release negative emotions. You need to be as baggage free as possible.

"
2031,18 july 2019,capricorn,"You are at your charming best, so don’t be surprised if people are drawn to you like moths to a flame! It’s also a grand day for romance as the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, are winking at each other across the heavens. Enjoy yourself–it’s way overdue.

"
2032,19 july 2019,capricorn,"The recent lunar eclipse occurred in Capricorn, highlighting your  needs and plans. Nothing wrong with that! And today Mercury retrogrades back into your house of cooperating with others. Therefore it’s time to reflect upon your closest connections and think about whether they’re helping or hurting you. If someone is taking more than they give, it’s time for a decision to be made.

"
2033,20 july 2019,capricorn,"A recurring theme in your chart this month has been: who’s on Team Capricorn? You’re better off flying solo than having people around who are going to hold you back. But a terrific Sun-Mercury aspect today helps you communicate and develop stronger bonds with people you love and trust. Build that inner circle.

"
2034,21 july 2019,capricorn,"Finding people who think and feel the same way you do is possible thanks to some positive planetary energy. The Sun and Mercury meet up in your house of partnering, a good thing indeed. The recent eclipses have pointed out relationships that aren’t the best for you (in all areas of your life). Now its time to forge some happy, productive alliances.

"
2035,22 july 2019,capricorn,"From your chart it’s clear that you are WAY overdue for a mental rest. You’re also in need of some good lovin’! Well, the Sun is now in Leo, your house of sex and intimacy. Deep emotions are found here, and not just the romantic kind. Clear your mind and your heart of negativity and make a vow to be good to yourself over the next four weeks. Avoid divas and trolls, and surround yourself with only the very best kind of people.

"
2036,23 july 2019,capricorn,"Honesty is the best policy, especially when you are quietly pondering your own life. So keep it real as you make decisions and move ahead. Over the next four weeks you can really dig into your psyche and do some important inner work. The peace of mind you’ll have will be worth the effort.

"
2037,24 july 2019,capricorn,"Your head and your heart are working together quite nicely, rather than battling it out! This is a good thing as you have a lot on your plate. The next week will be a thoughtful one. Meditating or journaling are good ways to get to the bottom of things.

"
2038,25 july 2019,capricorn,"Your libido and magnetism reach scorching  levels due to a lusty Mars-Jupiter trine! Seriously, if I could bottle and sell what you’ve got going on right now I could erase the national debt. So don’t be surprised if people are checking you out and making, uh, offers. Of course, you could decide to make them sweat and disappear into a cloud of mystery.

"
2039,26 july 2019,capricorn,"Stern Saturn in your sign is telling you to chill out. Yes, you–the most stable sign of the zodiac! The issue is that aggressive Mars is super active in one of the most emotional, psychological parts of your chart. While this can help you resolve stuff from the past that may be holding you back, it could also make you way too emo. When gentle Venus enters this sector tomorrow you’ll feel more relaxed.

"
2040,27 july 2019,capricorn,"You have a LOT going on in houses that deal with your closest connections and the emotions that get stirred up by them! Mercury is retrograde in the commitment sector, and the Sun and Mars are busy in the house of sex and intimacy. As a result your head and your heart may be going all over the place. Fortunately gentle Venus sashays into Leo today, helping you tiptoe through this emotional minefield with grace.

"
2041,28 july 2019,capricorn,"“It’s never too late to have a wonderful childhood.” I love that saying, because it’s a reminder that we, as adults, can treat ourselves well! We can be playful and curious. We can give ourselves the love and attention that maybe we didn’t get growing up. This is the message that the cosmos has for you today, Capricorn. It’s time for some extreme self care.

"
2042,29 july 2019,capricorn,"This could be a dramatic day as erratic Uranus is bringing out the diva side of people–hopefully not you! If anyone tries to push your buttons the best bet is to walk away. This is true in the weeks ahead too. There is a lot of cosmic activity trying to bring your own emotions into balance; you don’t need to be thrown off by anyone else’s nonsense.

"
2043,30 july 2019,capricorn,"Finding new ways to express yourself becomes a lot easier thanks to a helpful Mars-Neptune aspect. This is about how you think, speak and write. Maybe you need to become less forceful and more eloquent. Or perhaps you need to stop being a weenie and speak up for yourself. A few small changes can go a long way.

"
2044,31 july 2019,capricorn,"Relationships with others should start to smooth out now that Mercury is direct in the most diplomatic part of your chart. Thank heavens, because your chart is loaded with planets in emotional places. Not everyone will remain chill, but that’s no problem. Overall things are improving, which will have a positive effect on your state of mind.

"
2045,1 august 2019,capricorn,"The Leo new moon opens up a new phase in which your emotional state will calm down. Thus will be, in part, due to better financial opportunities coming your way, along with a more chilled out romance. But you’ll also be interested in doing some inner work, the kind that revolutionizes the way you think and feel.

"
2046,2 august 2019,capricorn,"Touchy, touchy! People could be more prickly than a cactus plant. That includes you, if you let them push your buttons. But with gentle Venus trying to heal your subconscious mind right now, you could choose to stay away from malcontents and divas. That’s right…..it’s a choice.

"
2047,3 august 2019,capricorn,"From your chart it appears that you could use a bit of adventure, so go out this weekend and find one! Take a quick trip out of town. Try a new sport or hobby, something unlike anything you’ve done before…which means that it pushes you out of your comfort zone. Plan a vacation to an exotic locale. Join a meet-up group where you’ll be in the company of people who think differently. It’s all about expanding your mind.

"
2048,4 august 2019,capricorn,"You’re in an interesting place, Capricorn. This week’s planetary energy allows you to step into a place of greater confidence and self awareness. It starts today as the two most powerful planets in the solar system, Mars and Pluto, hold a meeting in your house of identity. Inner changes will begin.

"
2049,5 august 2019,capricorn,"Being blunt is your usual MO, and hey…it works for you! People know what to expect from you, which is the unvarnished truth and logic. But a lunar aspect recommends being a bit softer and even more nebulous in your communications today. Don’t BS anyone, but don’t put it all out there either.

"
2050,6 august 2019,capricorn,"You’re in a highly creative place high now, but you run the risk of taking on too much. In typical Capricorn fashion you’ll tell yourself that somehow you’ll get it all done. Yes, but at what cost to your personal happiness? Be selective and choose the most important project or two.

"
2051,7 august 2019,capricorn,"You’ve got more going on behind the scenes than a CIA agent. Seriously, you’re going within and mining pure gold. Quietly, without fanfare, you’re coming up with amazing ideas and solutions to problems. You’re healing old emotional wounds and feeling better about yourself and the future. Like a proverbial phoenix, you will rise from the ashes.

"
2052,8 august 2019,capricorn,"Cosmic activity in the most secluded part of your chart indicates that you should spend more time with your thoughts. When it comes to other people, only let in a trusted few, the kind who support you wholeheartedly. This includes a lover, by the way. Your bond should be deep and unshakeable. If it isn’t, something needs to give.

"
2053,9 august 2019,capricorn,"Your ability to master your thoughts and emotions is increasing, Capricorn. As a result you’re becoming calmer and more at ease. Two major aspects arriving this Sunday will help you feel even better about yourself and your prospects. It’s nothing but clear sailing ahead.

"
2054,10 august 2019,capricorn,"You tend to be blunt, which is just fine in your opinion. After all, why waste time and words on fluff and idle chitchat? But from your chart it appears that you should be a bit more elusive today. Keep ’em guessing! You don’t have to lie, but you don’t have to be as direct as usual.

"
2055,11 august 2019,capricorn,"Emotional upheavals and drama get dialed WAY down thanks to three glorious aspects occurring today. First, Jupiter resumes direct motion in the house of the subconscious mind. You should feel more optimistic than you have in a long time. Then intelligent, logical Mercury zips into the house of emotions. And erratic Uranus goes retrograde in the house of romance and drama, which will actually smooth things over. Namaste!

"
2056,12 august 2019,capricorn,"You’re putting yourself first these days, and that’s a good thing. There has been a lot of emotional turmoil in your life lately, and chances are you’ve been too proud to show it. Set higher standards for the way you choose to live and how you expect to be treated. No big proclamations are necessary; just look out for #1.

"
2057,13 august 2019,capricorn,"Take the long view when it comes to your career and finances, Capricorn. You may have to take two steps back in order to move five steps ahead. The upcoming full moon on the 15th is all about earning more, so be prepared to explore new options.

"
2058,14 august 2019,capricorn,"Get in touch with your sweet, sexy side! A luscious Sun-Venus aspect is just the ticket for intimacy. If you are single and looking, tomorrow’s full moon could soon bring in a more mature, stable (but not boring) type. Pay close attention to the last week of August: it is loaded with good aspects for amour.

"
2059,15 august 2019,capricorn,"One door closes, another opens? That’s the message behind today’s full moon in your house of creating more financial and emotional stability in your life. A new job or promotion may come to pass, something that puts a lot more money in your bank account. A fresh chapter in love can begin, along with feeling better about yourself on a psychological level. This may mean releasing parts of the past but who needs the old crummy stuff, anyway?

"
2060,16 august 2019,capricorn,"Everyone thinks that you are as balanced and disciplined as a Zen monk. But you know the reality: you have moments (even days!) when you feel shaken up and emotions are going all over the place. Try to stay in Zen mode today, which may require counting to ten and taking a lot of deep breaths. Erratic Uranus is making people and situations volatile. Remain chill, grasshopper.

"
2061,17 august 2019,capricorn,"If you have HAD IT with someone’s attitude or actions, it could really catch up with you today. Maybe it’s a lover or co-worker. Maybe it’s the world at large. No problem, however. In 48 hours Mars enters the most optimistic, free-wheeling part of your chart. You’ll be so busy planning your next audacious adventure that you won’t have time to think about anyone else.

"
2062,18 august 2019,capricorn,"Everyone thinks that you’re so buttoned up and traditional. That you’re afraid to embrace new ideas and change. Man oh man, are they in for a wakeup call. You’re entering into one of the most visionary phases of your entire life, starting today. Mars enters your optimistic ninth house of thinking big and bold, to be followed by Venus and the Sun later this week. The next four weeks are going to be intense as you repeatedly break old rules and replace them with new ones. Image update, anyone?

"
2063,19 august 2019,capricorn,"Projects that you’re working on have excellent long term potential, so keep at them. You may be tired of slogging away but things are about to change for the better. Once the Sun enters Virgo later this week, momentum will build nicely, all the way through September.

"
2064,20 august 2019,capricorn,"Emotions could be raw today as the turbulent Moon is in a tough angle. But is there any real substance behind your feelings? Chances are you’re just tired and overworked. By tomorrow you’re back in charge, so let this temporary cosmic storm pass.

"
2065,21 august 2019,capricorn,"One of the most adventurous periods of your life is beginning as Venus joins Mars in the most daring part of your chart. Do you need to climb Mt. Everest?  No. Disappear into the sunset with a dashing foreign secret agent? No (although that does sound delightful). This may simply be about changing small things. It could be about doing a 180 too. It’s entirely up to you.

"
2066,22 august 2019,capricorn,"Wouldn’t it be nice if everyone on planet Earth was just as direct and logical as you? Hell yeah, but that’s not the way life works, something that will become apparent today. Foggy Neptune is going to confuse their words and meanings. You can choose to get annoyed or let this pass. By tomorrow you’ll be thinking about so many exciting options that you’ll forget all about this.

"
2067,23 august 2019,capricorn,"“Life is a daring adventure or it is nothing at all” said Helen Keller. This statement may sound like it fits a Sagittarius rather than you, but stereotypes are meant to be broken! Capricorn, you are now in the biggest rut-busting periods I’ve seen in your chart in years. The Sun is in your house of taking risks, joining Mars and Venus. Between now and September 14th you can accomplish things (or at least get them started) that you never dreamed possible.

"
2068,24 august 2019,capricorn,"Anyone who thinks that a Capricorn is the “traditional” type when it comes to love is dead wrong. You’ll have the chance to prove that today as lusty Mars winks at gorgeous Venus. These orbs meet in your house of adventure and thinking differently. A surprisingly sexy side of you is revealed!

"
2069,25 august 2019,capricorn,"A little voice inside your head may be telling you to not take some kind of a gamble. But where does that voice come from? Is it really yours, or is it your parents’ ? Maybe it stems from society and your need to fit in. Get ready to squash that little voice, Capricorn. This week brings eye-opening aspects that will completely change your point of view.

"
2070,26 august 2019,capricorn,"A series of ground breaking Uranus aspects starts today and continues all week, and they are designed to help you bust out of an old groove! This can truly be one of the one most liberating periods you’ve experienced in a while. Today you should be thinking about how to bring more pizzazz into your love life. No lover in sight? That could change in a heartbeat as unexpected meetings could occur.

"
2071,27 august 2019,capricorn,"It’s time to put away the Boss Man or Boss Lady persona, at least for today. We all know that you’ve got everything figured out, but we lesser mortals don’t need to be reminded of that fact. Besides, the cosmos its calling for you to start partying more and try on a new, creative image. What are you waiting for?

"
2072,28 august 2019,capricorn,"Things are starting to come together, much to your pleasure (and possible disbelief). But you’ve been busting your hump and it’s now time for some much needed R & R. With planets active in your houses of travel, fun, romance and shopping, start eating yourself well. Extreme self care is what it’s all about.

"
2073,29 august 2019,capricorn,"The next two to three weeks will be some of the most amazing you’ve had in a long while, Capricorn. Today lively Mercury glides into your house of taking chances and living bolder, a theme that has been building all week. Don’t be surprised if you feel restless or edgy as a result. You’re starting to realize that there’s a great big world out there, and you want a nice chunk of it for yourself!

"
2074,30 august 2019,capricorn,"Sayonara. Auf Wiedersehen. Ciao, baby. Buh-bye. That’s your new mantra as a scintillating new moon occurs in your house of living bigger and bolder. So say farewell to people, situations and your own personal attitudes that have been holding you back. There will be people who say that you’re not going to be successful, but what the hell do they know? Not much, something that will become apparent pretty soon.

"
2075,31 august 2019,capricorn,"You definitely need some down time, sea goat. The recent new moon occurred in your house of long distance travel, but if you don’t have the cash or the time for a long vacay, then book a weekend trip. Anywhere. As long as you have the opportunity to unwind that’s all that matters. Then book another one, OK?

"
2076,1 september 2019,capricorn,"Go with the flow and stop worrying about what you “should be doing.” Vivacious Venus tells you to lighten up and enjoy life. Unpredictable Uranus is having some fun in your romance and creativity sector. Is it such a bad idea to start scheduling fun times in your calendar?

"
2077,2 september 2019,capricorn,"The word “impossible” simply isn’t in your vocabulary these days! With high octane Mars meeting up with the fiery Sun in the most visionary part of your chart, you will have no shortage of amazing ideas brewing in your mind. This energy isn’t just happening today, by the way. It keeps right on going into the middle of the month, so run with it.

"
2078,3 september 2019,capricorn,"Quit doubting yourself, Capricorn! Everyone thinks you’re so focused and confident, but you know that’s not always the case. Right now (usually) optimistic Jupiter is in a funk, making you wonder if you’re on the right track. One of the issues at hand is that you have a number of options to choose from in life, and you’re getting stuck. Over the next two weeks you’ll narrow things down and the path will become clear.

"
2079,4 september 2019,capricorn,"Circumstances in your life are changing, subtly and slowly. Maybe you’re not even aware that this is going on. It’s a  positive situation, so don’t be too anxious to make decisions or change course. Give things time to gel.

"
2080,5 september 2019,capricorn,"You’re never satisfied with what you’ve accomplished, always looking for the next challenge. While this might wear out less hardy souls, it’s all in a day’s work for your sign. The good news is that some exciting new options are coming your way. Chances are that your imagination is already dreaming stuff up. Once Saturn goes direct in your sign on the 18th, you’ll have the confidence to dive in.

"
2081,6 september 2019,capricorn,"A little voice may be telling you that you’ve overlooked something, but that’s probably not the case. Right now there is a lot of cosmic activity encouraging you to think in big, bold brushstrokes. You’re not used to thinking in a daring way, and that little voice is having a fit. Ignore it and keep on being a visionary!

"
2082,1 january 2019,aquarius,"One of the biggest keys to enjoying 2019 is going to be the people in your world. You won’t be going it alone, that’s for sure. Be open to meeting new people, such as movers and shakers in the business world. Or people who share your charitable spirit, who want to do volunteer work. Hang out with your friends more and make new ones. These folks could introduce you to even more people, which will make your life so much richer.

"
2083,2 january 2019,aquarius,"All around the world people are setting goals and thinking big. Lucky for you, the Moon is in your house of ambition. It trines Chiron, the wounded healer. The question raised is this: are you setting your sights too low? Is a negative self image hampering your ability to progress and enjoy life? Let this sh** go, honey.

"
2084,3 january 2019,aquarius,"If you are a frequent visitor to My Stars!, you know that yesterday the cosmos asked you to do some inner work. To get rid of negative self-image issues. Well, today this becomes real. A Sun-Saturn aspect makes you Dump. The. Mental. Junk for good. It’s over.  Good riddance.

"
2085,4 january 2019,aquarius,"Right now you’re the vibiest sign of the zodiac, thanks to planets starting to pile up in the house of the subconscious mind. Things get even more intense as shrewd Mercury glides here today. You’re more psychic than John Edward, so don’t be afraid to use your intuition!

"
2086,6 january 2019,aquarius,"A solar eclipse occurs, illuminating the darker corners of your psyche. It occurs in your house of the subconscious mind, and it has a lot of healing energy associated with it. Uranus goes direct also in your house of communicating. It will become so much easier to get your point across to people.

"
2087,7 january 2019,aquarius,"Your ability to make new friends and enjoy the company of old buddies increases quite nicely. Venus is now in your house of camaraderie, urging you to get out of the house and network. You can do this for professional purposes too.

"
2088,8 january 2019,aquarius,"What you think and what you say need to be two different things today! A harsh Mercury-Mars square could prompt you to spill the beans. If in doubt, keep things to yourself. Friday is a powerful day for learning some interesting secrets.

"
2089,9 january 2019,aquarius,"Charming the birds from the trees is quite possible today, so get ready to dazzle! Something unexpected could arise from it, something beneficial. But you won’t fins out unless you GET out there and show the world what you’ve got.

"
2090,10 january 2019,aquarius,"You need to separate emotions from hard facts when it comes to money, Aquarius. That could be tough because murky Neptune is swirling its mist. This energy carries into next week, so keep it real.

"
2091,11 january 2019,aquarius,"It’s time, Aquarius. Time to release the negativity and the sorrows. The bad dramas and the bad dreams, not to mention the not so helpful habits you may have acquired. That’s because Pluto, the planet of death and transformation, is working its magic in your house of the mind. Welcome the change.

"
2092,12 january 2019,aquarius,"You’re in a social, lively mood thanks to the Moon and Mars in one of the chattiest parts of your chart. But you could be a bit TOO talkative, so watch what comes out of your mouth.

"
2093,13 january 2019,aquarius,"Pay closer attention to your own intuition rather than what others are telling you. Your mind is operating like a radio tower this week, so don’t ignore valuable intel that comes in from the ether.

"
2094,14 january 2019,aquarius,"One of the most important things that you can do for yourself right now is to create solid personal rituals. From your chart it appears that you could use a little bit more structure. It may not sound glamorous, but you’ll end up feeling more serene!

"
2095,15 january 2019,aquarius,"You can do terrific work behind closed doors this week. As a matter of fact, the cosmos encourages you to keep things hush-hush. Your Facebook friends don’t need to know everything that you’re up to. Pull yourself away from the crowd and consider your options.

"
2096,16 january 2019,aquarius,"You’re in a good position to put old dramas to rest. Who need some anyway? Not you. With the Sun entering your sign this coming Sunday, you should be traveling with as little baggage as possible.

"
2097,17 january 2019,aquarius,"
People could be throwing shade today, despite how friendly and diplomatic you may be. Let this pass. Tomorrow is a much better day for enjoying their company.

"
2098,18 january 2019,aquarius,"
You’re like a walking radio tower, psychic as all getout. Let those gems from the ether flow into your brain. But for heaven’s sake, don’t repeat them. You’ll regret it.

"
2099,19 january 2019,aquarius,"
Some unexpected news could come your way that will throw you off balance—but not for long. The Moon just entered your house of stability and the fiery Sun will soon be in your sign. Let it go and get ready to celebrate your birthday season.

"
2100,20 january 2019,aquarius,"
Happy birthday! The Sun is now in your sign, crowning you the celestial favorite. It’s important that you follow your own heart and mind over the next year. With Venus squaring Neptune today, it could be easy to be swayed by what others want for you–and from you. 

"
2101,21 january 2019,aquarius,"
Your birthday season is underway and a Leo lunar eclipse helps you ring it in! Leo is your seventh house of serious relationships, both personal and professional. There could be some major news arriving, But don’t act on it too quickly. You need to gather more intel. Wait until Mercury enters your sign on Thursday.

"
2102,22 january 2019,aquarius,"
Need help or advice? Looking for love? Maybe you just want to be around people who know how to live life to the fullest. If that’s the case, today’s Venus-Jupiter conjunction is perfect for being around people who fill you up. This is not a day to stay at home; get out there and mingle.

"
2103,23 january 2019,aquarius,"
This is Mercury’s last day in your house of the subconscious mind, and truth be told, you could feel a bit frazzled. Your thoughts and emotions will be all over the place. Fortunately this ends tomorrow, so don’t make any major decisions until then.

2106,26 january 2019,aquarius,"
What you want to say and what you should say are two different things. Megamouth Mars is in your house of communicating, but it opposes the Moon. Which means that you run the risk of shooting off your mouth and saying the wrong thing. Keep a lid on it.

"
2107,27 january 2019,aquarius,"
People could be critical today, but you shouldn’t care. With the Sun in your sign you know deep inside what’s right and what’s wrong. Let others troll and be little people.

"
2108,29 january 2019,aquarius,"
You mean business, and anyone who can’t see that is in for a big surprise! With the independent Sun forming a perfect angle with sharp-as-a-tack Mercury, you have the planning skills of a five-star general. 

"
2109,30 january 2019,aquarius,"

"
2111,1 february 2019,aquarius,"
Loose lips sink ships! Keep confidential information on the down low, Aquarius. Hidden detractors and dream stealers are lurking around. Don’t say (or text) anything that you’ll regret.

"
2112,2 february 2019,aquarius,"
It’s a great weekend for some impromptu adventures with your friends. If a lover suggests a quick trip out of town, say yes! A very social period opens up from now through the 14th; enjoy it.

"
2113,3 february 2019,aquarius,"
Tomorrow’s new Moon occurs in your sign, putting your dreams front and center. Why not do a little daydreaming in advance? Venus glides into your house of intuition and the subconscious mind today. Spend sometime thinking about what you would like to manifest in the year ahead.

"
2114,4 february 2019,aquarius,"
Woo-hoo!! Today’s new Moon occurs in your sign, and it’s your annual opportunity to start manifesting your dreams. Lucky Jupiter is in an excellent position from your house of friends, colleagues and mentors. Don’t be shy about relying on other people as you go through the remainder of the year.

"
2115,5 february 2019,aquarius,"
Yesterday’s new moon occurred in your sign, stirring up all sorts of ideas of fun things you’d like to pursue over the next year. So many ideas….so little time! Fortunately shrewd Mercury will help you narrow down your options today.

"
2116,6 february 2019,aquarius,"
Do the things that you don’t feel like doing today. Yup, stop procrastinating. Dig in and get it over and done with. Tomorrow has a much more playful vibe!

"
2117,7 february 2019,aquarius,"
Your generosity of spirit is legendary. Keep it comin’, as a wonderful Sun-Jupiter aspect indicates that others will be dazzled by your willingness to go the distance with others. You have so much to offer….why keep it all to yourself?

"
2118,9 february 2019,aquarius,"
A surprising piece of news could reach your ears today, something that will put a smile on your face. Process it. This energy crops up again next Wednesday, so be ready for the next scoop.

"
2119,15 february 2019,aquarius,"
No one is going to be able to confuse you this weekend, Aquarius. You are far too practical and level-headed. So let them prattle on about their nonsense, smile and say little. What they also don’t know is that your intuition is razor sharp too!

"
2120,2 march 2019,aquarius,"
Now that Venus is in your sign, it’s all about you! A helpful aspect with Chiron lets you know that you no longer have to hide in the shadows. Don’t play second fiddle to anyone or anything.

"
2121,10 march 2019,aquarius,"
Your motivation rises to locate more money and put it in the bank. Creative, inspirational Neptune is active today, helping you brainstorm fresh ideas. This energy goes on all week, so take it and run with it.

"
2122,11 march 2019,aquarius,"
It’s time to lighten up your load, Aquarius. Planets are active in your house of emotional and physical healing. Be ruthless. Cut out the people and activities that are superfluous. This may sound cold, it is necessary for your peace of mind.

"
2123,12 march 2019,aquarius,"
Follow your own wisdom today, Aquarius. You’re a friendly sign and you like it when everyone gets along. But people could be hard to please, so why bother? Give them all the space they need.

"
2124,13 march 2019,aquarius,"
Need to get rid of any (bad) habits? Maybe you just need to create smarter routines so that your life will be saner. Work on this over the next few days. The Sun is getting ready to enter one of the more social parts of your chart: pull things together now. 

"
2125,14 march 2019,aquarius,"
You’re going to be in a logical, level-headed mood, thanks to a Sun-Mercury connection. Use this energy to straighten out areas of your life that need to be fixed. People in your world may put up resistance, but too bad!

"
2126,15 march 2019,aquarius,"
Don’t try to get others to agree with your vision or your plans. They will only put up resistance, regardless as to how brilliant you may be! Wait until the full moon in Libra on the 21st to gain cooperation.

"
2127,16 march 2019,aquarius,"
The weekend ahead is perfect for resting up and pampering, Aquarius. It’s a smart time to create some healthy new rituals, such as meditating or going out for walks in nature. Your body and mind need to unwind.

"
2128,17 march 2019,aquarius,"
You need to mellow out a bit, Aquarius. With aggressive Mars in action, you may feel like bringing up old issues with people and getting in their faces. But a subtler approach is much better. Once the Sun changes signs on Wednesday, you’ll be able to speak your mind in a different way.

"
2129,18 march 2019,aquarius,"
Try to be diplomatic today, Aquarius. Just a little. The moon is in your house of partnering. You’ll get further if you consider the needs and opinions of others rather than just focusing on yourself.

"
2130,20 march 2019,aquarius,"
You’re in one sweet spot, Aquarius. Charismatic Venus is in your sign, placing all eyes on you. Now everyone is going to want to know what’s on your mind because the Sun enters Aries, your thinking and communicating sector. Just make sure to keep a little mystery about you!

"
2131,21 march 2019,aquarius,"
Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t so something, or that it’s impossible. The full moon occurs in your house of taking chances, but a tense Venus-Mars aspect could bring out the naysayers. There could also be old crap from your childhood that starts to get in the way. Kick it to the curb and charge ahead!

"
2132,22 march 2019,aquarius,"
Words can hurt, as we all know. So if anyone has been critical, today is a good time to process it and let it go. This is especially true of people who may have said things to you years ago, things that might still be ringing in your ears. Meditation and journaling could be a big help. 

"
2133,23 march 2019,aquarius,"
You could be feeling mighty moody today, Aquarius. The Moon is gliding through the most intuitive and emotional part of your chart. But this has a purpose, as the energy could make you aware of parts of your psyche that need to be cleansed and “updated”.

"
2134,24 march 2019,aquarius,"
Don’t be surprised if you have money on your mind–shrewd Mercury meets up with creative Neptune in your income sector. The next month is awesome for scoring more dinero, but this is the kind you earn. (Forget winning the lottery.) A week from today red hot Mars enters your talent sector, so sell those skills of yours.

"
2135,25 march 2019,aquarius,"
Your confidence rises and you’re not afraid to put yourself out there. This is overdue! Not everyone will agree with your ideas or image, but that doesn’t matter. Being true to yourself is what counts.

"
2136,27 march 2019,aquarius,"The weekend is approaching and it’s time to slow down a bit. You may come to the realization that relaxing at home quietly may be a better move than going out on the town. Besides, a family member may need some support right now–be there for them.

"
2137,31 march 2019,aquarius,"I hope you’re well rested! Right now you are looking like the numero uno social butterfly of the zodiac. First of all, the Sun entered your house of schmoozing and networking ten days ago. And today red hot Mars enters your house of romance, fun, shopping and dining. It’s a tough job but somebody’s got to do it.

"
2138,7 april 2019,aquarius,"You have a sense that things are going on behind the scenes, and chances are you’re right! This is about money and career, not love. And maybe it’s YOU who wants to get something done on the down low without people knowing. If that’s the case, more power to you, my friend.

"
2139,8 april 2019,aquarius,"With the moon in your house of home and family, it’s important to build bridges with people. From your chart, it appears that either you or they are being quite stubborn, something that you will realize on Wednesday. But today is well aspected for getting across to people in a common sense manner. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

"
2140,9 april 2019,aquarius,"What you’re thinking and what you reveal should be two different things, both today and on Saturday. A harsh Saturn aspect warns against revealing too much. This is true in your personal life as well as your business one. Not everyone around you has your best interests at heart. Play it safe.

"
2141,10 april 2019,aquarius,"The company you keep is going to become more important to you in the months ahead. Jupiter is now spinning backwards in your house of networking and friends. Are you surrounded by people who make your heart sign? If not it’s time to do some soul searching.

"
2142,11 april 2019,aquarius,"Ready to get inspired? Creative Neptune is active in your money sector, helping you consider new ways to pull in more cash. Pay close attention to gut hunches and dreams that you have over the next week. They could be more on point than you may realize.

"
2143,12 april 2019,aquarius,"Don’t be swayed by what others have to say. They may have your best interests at heart but only you can make decisions about where you’re headed. Let people know, in a diplomatic way, that you appreciate their input….but you’re going to do things your way!

"
2144,13 april 2019,aquarius,"What you feel like saying and what you should say are two different things. A Sun-Pluto square warns against revealing too much. Also, this is NOT a good for faking it or getting pushy. Give others the respect they deserve.

"
2145,14 april 2019,aquarius,"If you need to get something off your chest, then find a trusted confidante. A wonderful Sun-Jupiter aspect is perfect for opening up. Your own intuition is sharp too, so don’t be afraid to use it.

"
2146,15 april 2019,aquarius,"You’re a team player, it’s true. But today people may be ornery and unwilling to cooperate; or maybe it’s you who’s a tad cranky! Just do your own thing. By midweek everyone will be in a more diplomatic place.

"
2147,16 april 2019,aquarius,"Keep your wallet locked up and don’t sign any loan documents! Some murky planetary energy affects your finances over the next 24 hours. Emotions could run high and facts will be hard to get. Wait until Mercury changes signs tomorrow.

"
2148,17 april 2019,aquarius,"Get ready to schmooze….Mercury, the planet of communication, enters your house of talking! And thinking, writing and all other forms os self expression, like art. You’re entering into a wonderful time period in which you can dazzle people with your ideas and delivery. Socializing looks good too.

"
2149,18 april 2019,aquarius,"There’s a certain amount of energy that a caterpillar needs to burst out of its cocoon and become a magnificent butterfly. Right now you are ready  for the metamorphosis, but it seems to be taking a lot out of you. That’s OK. Today may be a bit draining, but tomorrow your energy returns.

"
2150,19 april 2019,aquarius,"If you’ve been considering making a bold move of some kind, it’s time to get off the fence. Tonight’s full moon occurs in your house of taking risks. Quit waffling and get on with it already. You’ll be surprised at how relieved you will feel.

"
2151,20 april 2019,aquarius,"The next four weeks can be quite heartfelt now that the Sun is in your house of family members and inner contentment. In a nice coincidence, gentle Venus glides into your house of self expression, enabling you to speak your mind. It’s a time for getting closer to loved ones and feeling better in your own skin.

"
2152,21 april 2019,aquarius,"If you’re not sure which direction to head in, then by all means talk to trusted friends or mentors. Likewise, seek out talking heads online who have been down your path before. Listen to podcasts or audio books. Someone out there has words of wisdom for you.

"
2153,22 april 2019,aquarius,"Sudden changes could happen with a housing or family matter, due to unpredictable Uranus stirring things up in your domestic sector. Sit tight because things may take a few weeks to unfold. Say little and observe a lot. Your intuition will guide you.

"
2154,23 april 2019,aquarius,"They say that people make the world go round, and in your case this happens to be true. A friend or acquaintance could prove to be unusually lucky for you in the near future. It’s also a smart time to expand your contact list, so reach out to new people and get to know them better.

"
2155,24 april 2019,aquarius,"May the healing begin! Probing Pluto starts to retrograde in your house of psychological and physical health, opening up an intense period that will last for several months. It isn’t always easy to face your bad habits and ailments, but so it is. Do this important work now and reap the benefits before 2019 comes to a close.

"
2156,25 april 2019,aquarius,"Right now you’re so psychic that it’s scary. What can I say? Use the sixth sense to your advantage, my friend! It’s not everyday that we are so blessed. Go ahead and do some digging.

"
2157,26 april 2019,aquarius,"The Moon in Aquarius could make you a bit territorial, ready to defend yourself from anyone who wants to mess around with your peace of mind. Which means that you may need to count to ten, breathe deeply and ignore certain malcontents.

"
2158,27 april 2019,aquarius,"They say that the best things in life are free, something to consider. An intense Mars-Jupiter aspect could make you crave designer clothes, Italian sports cars, $15 martinis and swag galore. Keep your money locked up and search out the simpler, cheaper goodies that are out there.

"
2159,28 april 2019,aquarius,"There is no gene that codes for discipline. Nor is there DNA that makes someone more efficient than someone else. So get that king or ridiculous thinking out of your head. Discipline is a skill that can be learned, and you need to develop yours. Get on with it.

"
2160,29 april 2019,aquarius,"Are you ready for some serious spiritual cleansing and healing? That is what is going to happen over the next few months. Today Saturn goes retrograde in the deepest, most mysterious part of your chart, the twelfth house. It’s time to take better care of your psyche.

"
2161,30 april 2019,aquarius,"The right side of your brain will be warring with the left today. It’s a grudge match between the logical left and the vibey right. Obviously this is not a smart time to make any major decisions. Emotions will run high and you could be feeling more defensive than usual. Wait a few days.

"
2162,1 may 2019,aquarius,"Your charisma is through the roof thanks to assertive Mars in your house of talent, fun and romance. Whatever you do, don’t hide this from the world! Today is super well aspected for dazzling others, both in your personal and professional lives.

"
2163,2 may 2019,aquarius,"The passive-aggressive types are on the prowl, so watch out for the silent but snarky types. It’s also a smart idea to say little about job hunts, business trade secrets, or anything else that you want to keep confidential. Loose lips will sink your ship.

"
2164,3 may 2019,aquarius,"Just in time for the weekend: a fabulous Mercury-Jupiter trine in your house of friends and networking. Basically the cosmos is giving you the permission to party like it’s 1999 to quote Prince…or 2019 for that matter. Besides, you could meet some exciting new people.

"
2165,4 may 2019,aquarius,"Home is where the heart is, and today’s new Moon is in your domestic sector! So don’t be surprised if you’re feeling all mushy and nostalgic. You could also feel like nesting, moving in with a lover or starting your own family. Single people, don’t give up hope…this lunation could bring in a lover before November.

"
2166,5 may 2019,aquarius,"Mars is in a pushy mood today, so make sure that you’re not acting too aggressively. This is especially true with a lover and friends. They’re not the same as you, with the exact same values and ideas. You need to accept that. But if the differences are too great, then you may need to question the relationship.

"
2167,6 may 2019,aquarius,"As Dorothy said in the Wizard of Oz,”there’s no place like home!” Mercury glides into your domestic sector, encouraging to you to open up the lines of communication with family members.

"
2168,7 may 2019,aquarius,"Loose lips sink ships! Keep things to yourself today. Stern Saturn is active in your house of secrecy, demanding that you reveal nothing. This includes your feelings as well as your opinions. Sometimes you just have to play the game this way.

A lovely Mercury-Uranus conjunction occurs in your house of home, family and contentment. Perhaps you find your dream home. Or a family drama is put to rest.

"
2171,10 may 2019,aquarius,"Ready to enter where angels fear to tread? I hope not! If your gut is telling you NOT to do something, pay attention.

"
2172,11 may 2019,aquarius,"A calming Sun-Saturn trine enables you to clear away negative emotions and feelings that you’re not good enough.

"
2173,12 may 2019,aquarius,"The Leo moon puts your relationships in sharp focus. Just how open are the lines of communication? How much respect are others showing you, and vice versa? The rest of the week is awesome for getting back on track with people, especially on Monday and Tuesday.

"
2174,13 may 2019,aquarius,"We all need help from time to time when it comes to straightening out our psyches. Maybe it’s the assistance of a therapist, maybe it’s just talking to a trusted friend.

"
2176,15 may 2019,aquarius,"Life takes a more practical turn due to two planets changing signs: Mars and Venus. Home and family issues get attention from gentle Venus, the peacemaker who also loves beauty (hmm…is it time to redecorate?). Mars moves into the most efficient part of your chart, pushing you to clean up your act both at home and the office. Diet and fitness routines could also take off nicely.

"
2177,16 may 2019,aquarius,"Need to draw a line in the sand? Then do it today, calmly and without anger. Logical Mercury and mature Saturn are woking hand in hand to help you set boundaries with other people. While you’re at it, take a good long look at yourself: what limits do you need to set on YOU? For example, maybe you need to stop working such long hours at the office and pamper yourself instead.

"
2178,17 may 2019,aquarius,"You may need to balance your own private time with the demands placed on you by friends and family. Today is a good time to think about how you’re going to pull this off. Otherwise everyone will be in a snit and you won’t be at peace.

"
2181,20 may 2019,aquarius,"You won’t be in the mood for needy people today, but that’s OK. With a Moon-Jupiter conjunction in your house of friends you’ll be able to pick and choose who you want around. From your chart it appears that you need to surround yourself with people who are more optimistic.

"
2182,21 may 2019,aquarius,"It looks like you are going to be bitten by the love bug! Not only does the feisty Sun roll into your house of romance today, so does lively Mercury.

"
2184,23 may 2019,aquarius,"Oohhh, watch what you say today, Aquarius. People will be touchy and take offense easily. Don’t try to force relationships. Slow and steady will win the day.

"
2185,24 may 2019,aquarius,"With the Moon in your sign, you should be feeling feistier than usual. So if anyone tries to convince you to do things the same old boring way, chances are you’re going to revolt. Do you really need people trying to hold you back? The truth is they may mean well, but it’s your life and you have to live it.

"
2186,25 may 2019,aquarius,"The moon is in Aquarius and all eyes are on you! They should be, anyway, so get the hell out of the house and make heads turn. With lucky Jupiter in your friendship zone, you should be connecting with old friends and meeting some interesting new ones in the process.

"
2188,27 may 2019,aquarius,"People may have been uncooperative lately, and you could be getting fed up. But a positive lunar aspect recommends that you change your approach with them. Their skulls maybe as thick as a brick wall, so you may need to promise them some kind of reward or benefit for playing nice.

"
2190,29 may 2019,aquarius,"You may not feel like playing by the rules today, but that’s not wise. Even if you’re a creative genius, or the most talented person in the office.

"
2191,30 may 2019,aquarius,"“To thine own self be true.” Those are wise words, Aquarius. With the Sun and expressive Mercury in the most creative part of your chart, you need to be your authentic self, not someone else’s version. That could be difficult due to a Mercury-Jupiter opposition. Trying to blend in with your friends or society is not  the way to go.

"
2192,31 may 2019,aquarius,"Your independent side could go on the back burner as a nurturing Venus-Neptune aspect pushes you to get closer to others. It’s quite a warm and fuzzy vibe, excellent for love and family matters too.

2193,1 june 2019,aquarius,"Reexamine your assumptions, Aquarius. You may think that you have the lowdown on everything and everyone but you don’t. Start paying attention to the details and the big picture will follow.

"
2194,2 june 2019,aquarius,"Releasing old dramas and negativity becomes so much easier thanks to a cathartic Venus-Pluto trine. Somehow living in the past and being pissed off a lot of the time just isn’t working for you, and this is a good thing. It’s called progress. It’s going to continue in the weeks ahead too.

"
2195,3 june 2019,aquarius,"The new moon occurs in your house of romance, and it has a nice balanced feeling to it. A Pluto-Venus aspect demands a drama-free relationship, one in which you feel as though your needs are being met. Singles, you could meet someone new between now and the end of the year. Just avoid entering into a relationship because your friends all seem to be moving on with their lives. Make the right decision.

"
2196,4 june 2019,aquarius,"The pace may pick up at the office or at home, now that lively Mercury is in your house of getting things done.

"
2198,6 june 2019,aquarius,"Lend a hand to people who need it. With the Moon in the most cooperative part of your chart, you can make a difference in someone’s life with even the smallest gesture. And the best part? Your kindness will come back to you.

"
2199,7 june 2019,aquarius,"Emotions could start spilling out of you, much to your surprise (and the people around you!). But this is a good thing. If you want people to be more cooperative you need to let them know what’s on your mind. They’re not mind readers, you know.

"
2200,11 june 2019,aquarius,"Petty disagreements and jealousy could spill over today, and it could come from any direction. Unless you want to be in the middle of it, remove yourself from snarling people. If you can’t, then keep calm and carry on without engaging. Cooperation returns on Friday and over the weekend. 

"
2201,12 june 2019,aquarius,"You’ve been operating on all eight cylinders lately, and no doubt you’re a little tired. The cosmos recommends that you slow down today and take better care of yourself. You’re not a bottomless well of energy. Chill.

"
2202,13 june 2019,aquarius,"Inspiration is a well that sometimes seems to dry up. But today you’ll be able to drill down and access more skill and taint than you ever expected.

"
2203,14 june 2019,aquarius,"Trust your gut today, Aquarius….it will guide you better than logic and the opinions of others. The great thing about a finely tuned sixth sense is that it can actually help you make more rational decisions. Nothing “woo-woo” about it.

"
2204,15 june 2019,aquarius,"You need more cooperation from the people around you. Over the next week you may realize that you’ve been taking on way too much responsibility. But trying to force others to be team players isn’t going to work. Maybe you need to find yourself a new team?

"
2205,16 june 2019,aquarius,"Stick to the facts and keep emotions and gut feelings out of things. Planets are lining up nicely in the most logical part of your chart, helping you see situations for what they really are. Keep this in mind midweek when things could get murky.

"
2206,17 june 2019,aquarius,"A full moon in your house of friends, colleagues and networking could bring a team project to a finale. But people may not be willing to play by the rules. Egos could get out of line. This energy could run through most of the week, by the way. Once the Sun enters cancer on Friday you’ll be more at ease.

"
2207,18 june 2019,aquarius,"Today’s aspects call for structure, plenty of it. You can’t afford to fly by the seat of your pants, no sirree. Old habits die hard and your mind may fight new changes. But consider how better off you’ll be if you change them.

"
2208,19 june 2019,aquarius,"Team efforts might go off the rails due to a Mars-Pluto smackdown. Cooperation will be hard to come by, so don’t expect it. The passive-aggressive types will be up to their usual petty nonsense too. Ignore it and move on.

"
2209,20 june 2019,aquarius,"A domestic or romantic situation could take a quick turn, and it may throw you off balance. Don’t get crazed! The Sun moves into one of the most practical parts of your chart tomorrow and sanity will return.

"
2210,21 june 2019,aquarius,"Summer is here (north of the equator anyway) and your mind may just be on chilling out and relaxing. But the Sun enters your house of efficiency, telling you to put down the beer and chips and start getting organized. In an interesting twist, Neptune starts to spin backward in your house of earning more. Time is money. The bottom line is that the more efficient and caught up you become, the more cash you’ll make.

"
2211,22 june 2019,aquarius,"Starting some kind of mental management practice could pay off big time, Aquarius. Mindfulness, meditating, journaling, affirmations—choose something that works for your personality and schedule. From your chart it appears that you need more stability in your life, and this is a good place to start.

"
2212,23 june 2019,aquarius,"Trying to get everyone to agree and play nice today could be a thankless task. Seems like everyone thinks that their way is the best. They may also have different dreams and values, which may be something that won’t change. Try not to be too rigid if that’s the case.

"
2213,24 june 2019,aquarius,"Bad habits, lack of routines, unclear expectations—all of these could come back to haunt you if you’re not careful. You may not feel like sticking to a regimen or creating better habits but in the end you’ll learn that discipline equals freedom.

"
2214,25 june 2019,aquarius,"Words can hurt or they can heal, something to remember today. So if anyone has been throwing shade your way, remember that it says more about them than it does about you. And be thoughtful when you communicate with others.

"
2215,26 june 2019,aquarius,"Is it time to team up? Mercury enters your partnership zone today, shining its light on personal and business relationships. You won’t be in the mood for dealing with anyone who isn’t a team player, so avoid the selfish types. Singles, the next two weeks are a good time to meet a keeper.

"
2216,28 june 2019,aquarius,"You can’t worry about what everyone is thinking, Aquarius. At some point you just have to let that go. You are your own unique person, and you’re entitled to live an authentic life.

"
2217,29 june 2019,aquarius,"No matter what kind of differences of opinion you’ve had with loved ones, it’s time to get past them. A wonderful Mercury aspect enables you and others to put ideas and feelings out there for discussion. Do this now before Mercury retrogrades on July 7th!

"
2218,30 june 2019,aquarius,"Let your freak flag fly? Going along with the group may not be an enticing prospect, so don’t bother. The Moon is in the most creative part of your chart, telling you to do your own thing. Problem is, others may not like it one bit! But who cares–this is your  life, babe.

"
2219,1 july 2019,aquarius,"Got the urge to merge? Mars moves into your house of serious relationships, making you a lot more interested in committing. This could be on a business level as well as a romantic one. There will be two eclipses in July though, so make sure that you connect with people who are willing to work as team players.

"
2220,2 july 2019,aquarius,"Old habits die hard. That reality may have been hitting you lately as you’ve tried to make changes that won’t stick. good news though: a solar eclipse tomorrow in your house of efficiency will help you create new systems that will actually work.

Fortunately Venus, planet of ease, glides into this sector today, helping to make things glow more smoothly. It’s almost like it’s New Year’s Day in July, Aquarius! out with the old and in with the new.

"
2222,4 july 2019,aquarius,"From your chart it appears that you’ve been trying to make progress with creating a happier mental state. (Hey, everyone needs to do this!) But a Saturn-North Node opposition could stymie your efforts today. The key is to create new habits, such as meditating every morning, or keeping a gratitude journal. Make it as regular as brushing your teeth if you want it to work!

"
2223,5 july 2019,aquarius,"If you need to straighten things out with a lover or friends, today’s the day. Optimistic Jupiter is well positioned in your house of camaraderie, smoothing the way for better relationships. Do this before Mercury starts to retrograde on Sunday!

"
2224,6 july 2019,aquarius,"What’s more important….a  fabulous sex life, or a strong, steady romance? Hell, can’t you have both? Planetary aspects this weekend could find you pondering this question. With the Moon in the most libidinous part of your chart today, chances are that sex is going to win.

"
2225,7 july 2019,aquarius,"Stop, start, stop, start. That’s what romantic relationships may feel like over the next two weeks! High octane Mars is trying to get things going, but Mercury is now retrograde in the same sector. Business alliances could also get stalled. Don’t fret: this is over on the 19th.

"
2226,8 july 2019,aquarius,"Stop being a martyr and ask other people for help, Aquarius. Otherwise you’re only going to have more work dumped on you, and you’ll be resentful to boot. A good place to start is at home or with your family. To your surprise they might actually be of service!

"
2227,9 july 2019,aquarius,"Breaking old habits and routines isn’t easy, and today could be one of those days when you really feel it. The Sun faces off against Saturn in the heavens, and this brings a battle of wills. Or in your case, your willpower.

"
2229,11 july 2019,aquarius,"Who’s running the “show” known as your life, Aquarius? From your chart it appears that there are too many people trying to butt in and have you do things their way. Hah! You won’t take kindly to it. As a matter of fact, you’ll probably tell them to stick it where the Sun doesn’t shine. Amen!

"
2230,12 july 2019,aquarius,"Like it or not, you do  need the help or advice of others, and right now is a great time to receive it. This weekend is well suited for socializing too, so while you’re meeting with people ask them for what you need.

"
2231,13 july 2019,aquarius,"A friend or contact could be unusually lucky for you, Aquarius. So could someone you spontaneously meet at a seminar or gathering of some kind. Which means that you need to be socializing, so head on out the door and mingle a bit.

"
2232,14 july 2019,aquarius,"A lunar eclipse is approaching in your house of endings, which means that it’s time to say buh-bye to all sorts of garbage that needs to go. Bad habits, negative thought patterns, toxic people, a soul-sucking job: yeah, that kind of stuff. But right now you seem to be resisting it with all your might. What are you, some kind of glutton for punishment? Leave martyrdom to Joan of Arc. Unless, of course, you want to be burned at the stake.

"
2233,15 july 2019,aquarius,"You know how you get the feeling that something just has to give?  Yup, we’ve all been there. Today Aquarians will feel this more than any other sign as the Moon forms a conjunction with Pluto and Saturn in your house of endings. Get ready, because tomorrow’s eclipse puts a great big pair of pruning shears in your hand and tells you to start cutting.

"
2234,16 july 2019,aquarius,"You’ve known for a long while that it’s time for change. Maybe you’ve avoided it. Perhaps you’re embracing it. Either way, today’s lunar eclipse in your house of closure and moving on will take you to a different, better place… whether you believe that or not! You can go kicking and screaming or sashay along with a confident smile on your face. It’s up to you.

"
2235,17 july 2019,aquarius,"What people say they’ll do and what they’ll actually  do are two different things. A Venus-Saturn opposition could make it difficult to discern what’s going on. If possible, wait until Friday before making up your mind. Intelligent Mercury enters one of the most logical parts of your chart then, making this an easy task.

"
2236,18 july 2019,aquarius,"It’s great day for holding practical talks with people. Maybe you need to ask the boss for a raise. Or perhaps you want to know where your romantic relationship is heading. Clear the air with a colleague or friend. You’ll feel better for it.

"
2237,19 july 2019,aquarius,"The recent lunar eclipse occurred in your house of closure and transition. telling you that it’s time to take much better care of yourself. In order to do that, you need better habits to support your physical and mental health. Mercury retrogrades into your house of habits and efficiency today, helping you analyze what you’ve done right and wrong in the past. This phase ends on the 31st, so start developing some productive new routines before then.

"
2238,20 july 2019,aquarius,"No one likes to believe that their thoughts are off base. Our opinions and beliefs can be similar to laws of the universe, kind of like gravity–unalterable! A Venus-Pluto opposition could make you realize that hey, some of the things you believe are  off base, and they need to be corrected. This won’t be an easy process but it is necessary.

"
2239,21 july 2019,aquarius,"OK Aquarius, buckle down and get the grunt work done. This is the Sun’s last day in your efficiency sector, so cut the procrastinating and get caught up. While you’re at it, you might decide to create better habits, and this includes diet and exercise. Tomorrow El Sol will be in a far more romantic place and you won’t want to be cleaning out your closets!

"
2240,22 july 2019,aquarius,"In the mood for love? I sure hope so, because that’s what the cosmos has in mind for Aquarians! Lusty Mars is already in your seventh house of amour and commitment. The Sun arrives today and Venus shows up on Saturday. There are some fabulous aspects ahead over the next four weeks, so if you’re looking for love–or want to create a deeper bond–the stars are in alignment.

"
2241,23 july 2019,aquarius,"Patching things up with someone is the order of the day, Aquarius. Mars is in your house of diplomacy and partnering, and the Moon is in the house of talking and all forms of self expression. Life is too short to hold grudges, so extend the olive branch.

"
2242,24 july 2019,aquarius,"Push hard at work so that people can see what you’re made of. With Venus and Mercury operating at an expert level in your efficiency zone, you’ll be able to show the muckety mucks that you have talent. Once August rolls around you should see the results of your efforts.

"
2243,25 july 2019,aquarius,"Your sign is famous for being friendly, but cosmic aspects over the next week could turn you into a Class A Social Butterfly. Hey, why not share your fabulousness with an adoring public? A red hot Mars-Jupiter trine will put you in the path of friends, lovers, movers and shakers, and people who share your interests. But this isn’t about making casual acquaintances: there is a feeling of longevity here.

"
2244,26 july 2019,aquarius,"People could get pushy, demanding that you do things their way. The best move is to remain silent and quietly observe what’s going on. You don’t need to let them in on your thoughts; say little and don’t commit. Over the next week you’ll be able to gain more cooperation and authority.

"
2245,27 july 2019,aquarius,"The urge to merge grows stronger as Venus enters your commitment sector. New romantic and business alliances can be formed, while existing ones get a shot of pizzazz injected into them. Mercury is  still retrograde, though, in your house of cooperating and teamwork. If you want things to move forward you need to find balance. One person shouldn’t be doing all of the “heavy lifting” while the other one coasts.

"
2246,28 july 2019,aquarius,"If you’ve had trouble in the past getting through to someone, today might bring a change. A positive Sun-Chiron aspect gives you hope and  eloquence. You’re not stuck, something that you may finally realize.

"
2247,29 july 2019,aquarius,"No one knows better how to push your buttons than family. Your lover may have become a pro at it too. And  they all may be in a button-pushing mood today, so unless you enjoy getting aggravated, avoid them! Some boundaries need to be set but right now isn’t the time. Tomorrow is though.

"
2248,30 july 2019,aquarius,"Unless you’re living alone in a hut on a mountaintop somewhere, you have to deal with other people. So like it or not, you’re going to have to deal with their demands and issues and emotions. If you want to remain serene, you’ll need to find some new ways to handle their sh**, because what you’ve been doing isn’t working. So says the cosmos anyway! The good news is that inspirational Neptune has your back and will provide you with some new tactics.

"
2249,31 july 2019,aquarius,"Remember that song “Whistle while you work” from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves? That’s going to be you over the next two weeks, smiling like a person possessed as you cut through tasks. Yup, Mercury has just gone direct in your house of efficiency and procrastination is OVER. Of course, maybe the dwarves were tossing back some vino as they worked, which means that you can too.

"
2250,1 august 2019,aquarius,"Ready to commit? If so, then the cosmos has your back! The Leo new moon could bring about a deeper connection, not only in love but in business too. Over the next few months singles could meet a new lover. Teaming up for career success is also a good possibility. I have to warn you, though–Uranus squares the new moon, indicating that you’ll be pushed past your comfort zone a bit in these relationships. But that’s what personal growth is all about.

"
2251,2 august 2019,aquarius,"People may be taking you for granted, not realizing that you’ve had enough. Sitting back and taking it is not the best option right now. You know the saying: give people an inch and they’ll take a mile? It applies to you, Aquarius. Just don’t flip out when you tell them to back off.

"
2252,3 august 2019,aquarius,"Feeling sexy and soulful? You should be, thanks to the Moon in the lustiest part of your chart! The entire weekend is well suited for romance. If you’re single, then take this special energy and pamper yourself. Next week could bring a new lover into your life, and you want to be as gorgeous and serene as possible.

"
2253,4 august 2019,aquarius,"Getting in someone’s face simply won’t work, no matter how much you want to! Nope, the best way to gain control over a situation–or fix it–is to sit back and quietly assess what’s going on. Say little and wait til Wednesday, a much better time for getting your point across.

"
2254,5 august 2019,aquarius,"With the Moon in your house of travel and adventure, it’s time to plan something that will put a smile on your face. If you think you can’t afford it, guess again. From your chart it appears that there’s a budget option, if you’re willing to look for it. This also applies to launching a startup or going to school. Seek and ye shall find.

"
2255,6 august 2019,aquarius,"Just when you thought that things were quieting down, someone (or something) comes along and rattles you. Don’t worry though–this passes quickly. By tomorrow you’ll be able to gain the upper hand. It’s just a matter of waiting it out.

"
2256,7 august 2019,aquarius,"You’re in an amazing position to meet people who share your views and dreams. A lovely Sun-Jupiter aspect brings you new connections, from potential friends to colleagues to a lover. Make a vow to spend more time with people you already know, the kind who have your back and never put you down. It’s about quality in your alliances, not quantity.

"
2257,8 august 2019,aquarius,"The world has plenty of people who don’t want to see you succeed and be happy, but there are plenty of others who do. A terrific Venus-Jupiter aspect puts you in touch with like minded people, the kind who can be friends or lovers for life. Be selective about whom you associate with. There’s nothing ruthless about wanting to be around folks who lift you up emotionally.

"
2258,9 august 2019,aquarius,"You’re not the type to wear your heart on your sleeve. As a result, people are often at a loss trying to figure out what is going on in your mind. Today’s a smart time to let a few people in on your thoughts. Make sure that (a) they deserve it and (b) they have your back.

"
2259,10 august 2019,aquarius,"It’s smoother sailing ahead for personal relationships, Aquarius! Jupiter goes direct in your house of friends and teamwork. Smart little Mercury zips into your serious relationship sector, joining the Sun. And Uranus retrogrades in the house that governs your family, which can actually be beneficial! Uranus is erratic when direct, so this should soften its rough edges.

"
2260,11 august 2019,aquarius,"It’s smoother sailing ahead for personal relationships, Aquarius! Jupiter goes direct in your house of friends and teamwork. Smart little Mercury zips into your serious relationship sector, joining the Sun. And Uranus retrogrades in the house that governs your family, which can actually be beneficial! Uranus is erratic when direct, so this should soften its rough edges.

"
2261,12 august 2019,aquarius,"Sshhh! There’s a lot going on in that brain of yours. Thoughts are getting processed and ideas are hatching. Healing occurs and you’re starting to feel better about things. Perfect timing, considering that the full moon on Thursday occurs in your sign. It’s as though mental house cleaning is going on. Buh-bye, cobwebs.

"
2262,13 august 2019,aquarius,"Stubbornness sets in as the Moon is in your sign, opposing Mercury. Make an effort to listen to what others have to say. They may have some valuable insight for you, but you’ll never hear it if you’re too busy having a snit. Believe it or not you don’t have all of the answers.

"
2263,14 august 2019,aquarius,"Getting close to someone becomes so much easier with a Sun-Venus meet up! This could be on a personal or professional level, but love is wonderfully aspected. Between now and the end of August your ability to forge a deep, intimate bond is there. Single Aquarians could meet someone new, especially when Mars changes signs on the 18th.

"
2264,15 august 2019,aquarius,"Gotta love it! Tonight’s full moon occurs in Aquarius, spotlighting every area of your life. All of your hopes, dreams and plans are getting the star treatment. As full moons wrap things up, a closely held ambition or plan could come to pass over the next two weeks. Just keep your family members out of your business, as they could try to influence you to do things their ay.

"
2265,16 august 2019,aquarius,"Uranus is acting up in one of the most sensitive parts of your chart, making you want to rebel against people and situations. The problem is that a lot of this may be in your mind and not based on reality. So before you say or do something you’ll regret, zip your lips and keep your fingers off of the keyboard.

"
2266,17 august 2019,aquarius,"Old habits die hard, something that could be apparent today. Strict Saturn is pushing you to change for your own good, mentally and physically. But you seem to be resisting it. Maybe you need to go about things a different way! Just because a habit is a habit doesn’t mean that it’s the right one for you. Consider other options.

"
2267,18 august 2019,aquarius,"Pay close attention to your thoughts and emotional state, Aquarius. Planets are starting to enter one of the most sensitive parts of your chart, with Mars arriving today. In the weeks ahead your feelings could go all over the place as you sort things out.

"
2269,20 august 2019,aquarius,"No matter how much you’d like to be forthright and clear things up with someone, you’re probably not going to get too far.

"
2270,21 august 2019,aquarius,"Ggrrr!!!! Sexy Venus joins lusty Mars in your house of intimacy and libido, heating things up quite nicely. While you certainly can enjoy some magical moments in the boudoir, creating a deeper emotional bond with a lover is favored. If you’re looking for a new lover, someone could come along within the next month.

"
2271,22 august 2019,aquarius,"You may need to compromise with others today, even if you don’t like them or agree with them! Just be careful when it comes to money. This is not an area where you should be giving in. Tomorrow the Sun rolls into your net worth sector, so wait until then before making any major decisions.

"
2272,23 august 2019,aquarius,"Get ready for the #feels, Aquarius! The mighty Sun is now in your house of sex, emotions and intimacy. And  net worth I might add. Since love and money are two of the hottest topics out there, you can expect the next four weeks to be pretty intense. This is not a bad thing, however. The opportunity to create a strong emotional and financial foundation is out there if you seek it.

"
2273,24 august 2019,aquarius,"Today promises to be a good one for all signs of the zodiac as Mars and Venus form a conjunction, which means that their energies mesh.

"
2274,25 august 2019,aquarius,"Anger and frustration can be useful emotions if they help you realize that you’re not where you should be in life. Otherwise they’re a waste of time and energy.

"
2275,26 august 2019,aquarius,"A romantic or family matter could suddenly make a turn for the better, much to your relief. With Uranus active in your house of inner comfort, you definitely need a break from aggravating situations. Be open to what others have to say, and open to the possibility that things can and will improve.

"
2276,27 august 2019,aquarius,"Doubts might start creeping in to your mind, but are they based on reality? Chances are they’re not. Subterranean Pluto is digging deep into your psyche, stirring things up. Don’t make any decisions under this aspect or say something that you’ll regret later. Tomorrow brings clarity.

"
2277,28 august 2019,aquarius,"It’s not your job to fix the world and rescue everyone from their problems, something you may realize today. With healing Uranus in a fabulous aspect from your house of inner comfort, right now you should just be worrying about you.

"
2278,29 august 2019,aquarius,"Ah, peace at last. Logical Mercury enters one of the most emotional parts of your chart, helping you to calm down.

Their insight is valuable and will enable you to move forward.

"
2279,30 august 2019,aquarius,"Just what do you need in your life to feel serene and secure? That’s the question asked by today’s new moon in Virgo. What was important to you even a month ago may not even matter anymore. And the next two weeks will bring even more ruminating on your part. Give yourself time to work things out.

"
2280,31 august 2019,aquarius,"If you go through life with too many rules–either for yourself or other people–you’re bound to be disappointed, Aquarius. Not to mention that you’ll make things harder for everyone. Relax and give yourself (and others) permission to do their own thing. Heaven knows our society has enough rules as it is.

"
2281,1 september 2019,aquarius,"At the end of the movie The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy realizes a few things. One is that there is no place like home. But the other (more important) lesson is that she and the other characters–the Cowardly Lion, Tin Man and Scarecrow–all had great things inside of them, wonderful values and skills that they underestimated. That’s the lesson the cosmos has for you today. Go within.

"
2282,2 september 2019,aquarius,"Yowza! This is looking like one passionate  day. Lusty Mars meets up with the Sun, setting your desires on fire.

But you may not be able to hear it with all of the noise being created by society, social media, the news, and the people you interact with personally. Try to pull away from the incessant “chatter” and listen to what your heart is telling you.

"
2284,4 september 2019,aquarius,"People could be working their own agendas today, but in a very quiet manner. Therefore you need to keep an eagle eye on what they’re saying and doing. The good news is that you intuition is strong. If something doesn’t feel right in your gut, pay attention.

"
2285,5 september 2019,aquarius,"People often laugh and say that psychics, intuition and shamanism are “woo-woo”, but is that really the case? Right now your sign is in a really vibey place. So don’t be surprised if you find yourself studying ancient philosophies or delving into your own sixth sense. It’s amazing what you will discover.

"
2286,6 september 2019,aquarius,"A quiet kind of confidence is sinking in, which is a healthy way to go through life. You don’t need anyone’s opinions or approval. Nor do you need to fit in with a group, or society. This energy continues to build all the way to the full moon on the 14th, and by that time you’ll feel like a new person.

"
2348,13 april 2019,pisces,"We all have values and standards that are important to us. Some people have high standards, others don’t. Some folks create their own rules and others are easily swayed by their friends, lover or family. What’s important right now is that you create your own rules and live by them. What’s right for you may not be for other people.

"
2349,14 april 2019,pisces,"One of the best things that you could do with your life is to find some new friends, people who share your values and dreams.

"
2350,15 april 2019,pisces,"Stick to the facts today and you’ll do fine. Rely only on optimism and shaky dreams instead, and you’ll screw up. This is a message that’s going to carry forward into the next few weeks, by the way, so get used to it.

"
2351,16 april 2019,pisces,"Touchy! It may be unusually easy for others to push your buttons due to a Moon-Neptune opposition. Unless you want to give them the satisfaction of knowing they were able to irk you, don’t go there. Take a deep breath and count to ten.

This could be via social media, your resume, a buzz reel, the lecture circuit or just having cocktails with people who count.

"
2356,21 april 2019,pisces,"People tend not to like the word “discipline” because it conjures up thoughts of hard work, gritted teeth and giving up the juicier things in life.

"
2359,24 april 2019,pisces,"Who’s got your back? That’s the question asked by Pluto as it begins to retrograde in your house of friends and colleagues. Don’t feel guilty about becoming very selective about whom you let into your life, Pisces.

"
2372,8 may 2019,pisces,"Go loud and proud, Libra! A vivacious Mercury-Uranus aspect tells you to shout it from the mountaintops, whatever “it” means to you. A video could go viral.

"
2373,9 may 2019,pisces,"Luck is on your side when it comes to finding a new job or scoring a raise. This is also a smart time to beef up your revenues if you’re self-employed.

"
2380,16 may 2019,pisces,"It takes teamwork to make the dream work, and you may be the person who keeps the team in line.

"
2381,17 may 2019,pisces,"Your self talk is a big predictor of how happy and successful you’ll be, today and in the future.

"
2384,20 may 2019,pisces,"A nagging little voice in your head may be telling you that you shouldn’t try something. Or that you’ll never be able to pull it off.

2390,26 may 2019,pisces,"You’re starting to realize that you don’t have to get upset over every tiny little thing that happens. Peace of mind is becoming a lot more important to you. You know what they say: don’t sweat the small stuff. If you make this your mantra, you will be in a much better head space.

"
2391,27 may 2019,pisces,"A lot of internet and publishing gurus hype the idea of getting in touch with your authentic self. But there really may be something to it! If you feel as though you’re not living in an authentic manner, a wonderful lunar aspect will help you dig deep and find out who you really are.

"
2392,28 may 2019,pisces,"People may act like they know what they’re talking about… but do they? Don’t assume just because someone appears to be an authority figure that they know what’s going on. With the moon in your sign, your intuition is running high. Pay attention to it. Your own inner wisdom may be the smartest voice out there.

"
2393,29 may 2019,pisces,"Someone may try to give you advice and if you’re wise you will listen. But your ruler, Neptune, is acting a bit cranky and doesn’t want to take orders from anyone else. Hey, you don’t have to make a decision right now. Just hear out what the other person has to say and let it sink in.

"
2394,30 may 2019,pisces,"Someone may try to show you who’s boss. Or they may think that they know more than you. Hah! As if. But don’t rub their noses in the fact that you’re the one with the smarts. Let them fall flat on their faces and figure it out later. It’s called karma, my friend.

"
2395,31 may 2019,pisces,"You simply can’t go wrong this weekend with a Neptune-Venus trine. You’ll be at your charismatic best, and with Venus in your house of socializing, it’s in the best interest of the public for you to be out there! Have fun.

"
2396,1 june 2019,pisces,"With charismatic Venus in your house of communicating, you’ve got the gift of gab….so work it! Let people know what’s in your heart and mind. They need to know where you’re coming from. Sometimes all you have to do is put an idea out there, and people will flock to you.

"
2397,2 june 2019,pisces,"You need to start networking, Pisces. Find people who share your interests. Start surrounding yourself with others who are going places, who know how to live life to the fullest. Join a master mind group. Make new friends. It’s time to branch out.

"
2398,3 june 2019,pisces,"If you give all your power to other people, you will never be at peace. That’s the message behind today’s new Moon in Gemini. This happens to be the house that governs your home and family, but it also deals with inner contentment. Start weeding out people who want to control you. You’re an adult and you don’t have to act like dog responding to its master.

"
2399,4 june 2019,pisces,"Yes. Mercury is in your house of romance, fun and creativity. Over the next three weeks you can explore a side of yourself that has been pushed aside by stress and work demands. Some interesting and unexpected things could come your way over the next few days, so keep an open mind and be ready to take advantage of them!

"
2400,5 june 2019,pisces,"No one knows how to work your nerves like family, and they could be loaded for bear today. Arguments could erupt as old resentment comes to the fore. Avoid this if at all possible. Thursday and Friday have much better energy, and matters could actually get resolved.

"
2401,6 june 2019,pisces,"If you want to get someone’s attention, a gentle touch will do. There’s no need to be flashy or loud. You have a lot going for you; just let it shine naturally.

"
2402,7 june 2019,pisces,"Spontaneity rules as unpredictable Uranus is in the mood for fun, flirting, shopping and dining out. Don’t you think it’s time to treat yourself? Hell yeah!

"
2403,11 june 2019,pisces,"There are only 24 hours in a day, and so much you can do. If your job, errands and commitments are cutting into your personal time, you may need to reduce the hours you’re spending there. The full moon on the 17th ought to help you cut back on career demands at the very least.

"
2404,12 june 2019,pisces,"Some nice things will be coming your way, and you deserve to enjoy them. Quit thinking that love and fun and money and happiness are things that only other people can experience. It’s your turn now, Pisces.

"
2405,13 june 2019,pisces,"A battle may be brewing over your private life and what should go public. Don’t be afraid to let people know that there are limits to what you intend to expose. After all, you are entitled to your own secluded world.

"
2406,14 june 2019,pisces,"A lusty, lively Mars-Neptune trine urges you to have as much fun as possible this weekend. But choose your companions well. Anyone who is a downer need not be around!

"
2407,15 june 2019,pisces,"Which would you prefer: to live in the past, the present or the future? If you’re happy with the present, so be it. But if not, then focus on what lies ahead. As for dwelling in the past? Who needs it?

"
2408,16 june 2019,pisces,"You need some time for just enjoying life, without a lot of drama coming from friends or a lover. So choose your company wisely this week, as tense aspects on Wednesday could stir up heavens know what. If this means going it alone, so be it.

"
2409,17 june 2019,pisces,"Ready for kudos? A raise and a promotion? A new gig? It could happen soon, thanks to the full moon in your career zone. Actually, all of your big plans are spotlighted by this lunation, so expect some happy news. Just be clear as to where you’re heading next, as Neptune, your ruler, is in a funky spot.

"
2410,18 june 2019,pisces,"Meeting new people is well aspected under today’s planetary skies, so be open minded! From your chart it appears that some of the people in your world are too rigid. No problem: some flexible movers and shakers are on the horizon.

"
2411,19 june 2019,pisces,"Differences of opinion could arise under today’s cloudy cosmic skies. You might also realize that your values don’t match those of other people, including loved ones. You’ll have the opportunity to work this out, though, once the Sun changes signs on Friday.

"
2412,20 june 2019,pisces,"Open mouth, insert foot? You could really say (or text) the wrong thing today, thanks to unreliable Uranus acting up in your communicating sector. Think twice, my friend. Neptune starts to retrograde tomorrow in Pisces, and you’ll become quite reflective.

"
2413,21 june 2019,pisces,"Your ruler, Neptune, starts to retrograde in Pisces today. Questioning who you are and where you’re heading in life could be the end result. Hey, this is a good thing—everyone needs to do this, otherwise they’ll be stuck in a rut. Coincidentally the Sun enters your house of romance, so you may be pensive about your love life first.

"
2414,22 june 2019,pisces,"The Sun just entered your house of romance and creativity…so what are you waiting for? You need to shake up this part of your life for the better. Even if you don’t lift a finger to do so, the solar eclipse on July 3rd will grab you by the shirt collar and drag you into a more colorful place. No point in waiting for that to happen—take some baby steps today.

"
2415,23 june 2019,pisces,"From your chart it appears that you need some down time for yourself and loved ones. Don’t get caught up in late hours at the office or bringing work home. If you are too driven to achieve goals, you may end up alienating the people you care about the most. Maintain the proper balance!

"
2416,24 june 2019,pisces,"You tend to be the sensitive sort and this is admirable. But sometimes ya just gotta deal with things head on with no emotion involved. Today is one of those times, so man or woman up and get to it!

"
2417,25 june 2019,pisces,"With Neptune retrograde in your sign, you may feel a bit discombobulated. More structure is needed in your life and today brings a lunar aspect that will help you create it. This may mean getting rid of old habits and beliefs, bus so be it!

"
2418,26 june 2019,pisces,"The Sun is in your house of wining, dining and frivolity, but Mercury says “Uh, you need to get some stuff done.” The messenger planet just entered your house of efficiency, so just suck it up and get things done already. If you don’t do so before July 7th–when Mercury goes retrograde–you’ll regret slacking off!

"
2419,28 june 2019,pisces,"Friendship counts for a lot so be there for someone if they need it. Likewise, you should feel free to reach out to a friend or colleague if there is something on your mind.

"
2420,29 june 2019,pisces,"Take it easy on yourself, Pisces. With Mercury in your house of efficiency you are probably motivated to get as much done as possible. But you run the risk of burning out, so take a break if you need one. Tomorrow will arrive and your to-do list will still be there.

"
2421,30 june 2019,pisces,"Sometimes we set goals or have opinions and then fiercely stick to them….even if they’re no longer right for us. A Moon-Jupiter opposition could make you feel uncomfortable as you realize that something needs to change. Pay attention!

"
2422,1 july 2019,pisces,"The pace of life picks up now that Mars is in the most efficient part of your chart. You’re going to want to get things done so that you can relax and enjoy life more. Discipline has its rewards!

"
2423,2 july 2019,pisces,"People might be way too opinionated, butting into your business…even if they mean well! Cosmic energy this week could make you wary of letting others know too much about what is going on in your life. No big deal: you’re under no obligation to let them know everything.

"
2424,3 july 2019,pisces,"Yeah, baby! A whopping solar eclipse takes place in your house of having fun and enjoying the sweeter things in life…like romance, shopping, dining, luxury, and socializing. It’s a tough job but somebody’s gotta do it. Might as well be a Pisces! But when you choose people to spend time with, make sure that they’re not simply looking out for themselves. You need generous, fun people who have your back.

"
2425,4 july 2019,pisces,"Does it seem as though everyone wants a piece of you? Friends and family may be vying for your time and attention, Pisces. There’s nothing wrong with that unless they start getting cranky about it. Remember to pay attention to the people who you really want in your life over the long term.

"
2426,5 july 2019,pisces,"You could feel the urge to get organized this weekend as the moon is in the most efficient part of your chart. So go ahead, dive in….to the basement, garage, closet, e-mail account, whatever. Face the scary goblins that lurk underneath the piles o’ stuff and vanquish them.

"
2427,6 july 2019,pisces,"The Moon glides into your house of serious relationships, and the mood is light and carefree. You may feel like talking about deep issues but this weekend is geared more for flirting and play time. The big issues can wait a few days.

"
2428,7 july 2019,pisces,"Cooperation counts, and you’ll be paying close attention to the people you can count on….and those you can’t. Mercury is now retrograde in your house of teamwork and getting things done. Don’t cut someone slack if they don’t deserve it. And make sure that you’re pulling your own weight, both at the office and in your personal life.

"
2429,8 july 2019,pisces,"It may be a Monday but it’s a fabulous time for being spontaneous, creative and flirty! (Hmmmm…..should you call in sick? Not a bad idea.) A spunky Venus-Uranus aspect brings sizzle to shopping, romancing and dining out. Go out there and have some fun.

"
2430,9 july 2019,pisces,"You don’t need friends or colleagues who bring extra drama into your life, something that is becoming apparent. So consider who you’re hanging out with and why. If a relationship is too lopsided or troublesome, it may be time to move on.

"
2431,10 july 2019,pisces,"Your ability to let go and enjoy life increases due to an inspirational Neptune aspect. What’s the point in holding grudges and rehashing crummy memories? Learn how to live for the moment. Carpe diem–seize the day!

"
2432,11 july 2019,pisces,"Someone could have a meltdown today as unpredictable Uranus squares volatile Mars. Hopefully it won’t be you. But you could be at the receiving end of this, and pushing back won’t help things–it will only make them worse. When the Moon enters the most authoritative part of your chart tomorrow, you’ll be able to calmly get the situation under control.

"
2433,12 july 2019,pisces,"Flying by the seat of your pants just isn’t going to cut it this weekend, so slow down and take your time. Thinks about what absolutely has  to get done. Take care of that first and then go off and enjoy yourself!

"
2434,13 july 2019,pisces,"Right now you’ve got such good cosmic mojo going on that a lot of things will start going your way. Which will make people say, “Oh, you’re just lucky.”  The hell you are. You’ve put a lot of effort into reaching this place. It’s just that you make it look so darn easy!

"
2435,14 july 2019,pisces,"People may be working your nerves, especially close connections. You can blame it on a lot of things; the upcoming lunar eclipse in your house of friends and acquaintances. Or today’s stinky Sun-Pluto opposition. Everyone has an opinion and people are being petty on top of it. You can choose to join the fray or walk away from it.

"
2436,15 july 2019,pisces,"Take an inventory today of the people in your world. Who has your back? Who knows you best, and always comes  through with a smile and a kind word? Right now planetary activity in your chart asks you to remain in only the strongest, most mature relationships. Flakes and drama queens need not apply.

"
2437,16 july 2019,pisces,"Who’s on Team Pisces? That’s the question asked by the lunar eclipse in your house of friends and networking. Not everyone will make the cut. If someone has been more of a frenemy than a true BFF, it may be time to cut the tie and move on. The good news is that new people will be coming into your life, the kind who share your values.

"
2438,17 july 2019,pisces,"Make sure that you’re on the same page with people, Pisces. A Saturn-Venus opposition may blind you into overlooking key differences that exist. These are the kinds of differences that could make or break a relationship or plan down the road, so take care of this now.

"
2439,18 july 2019,pisces,"Got charisma? Check. Creativity? Check. An air of mystery? Double check! Yeah, you’ve got it going on today, Pisces. A wonderful Venus-Neptune trine makes you the person to listen to and watch. Also the person to flirt with!

"
2440,19 july 2019,pisces,"How deep is your love? That’s the question asked by the cosmos as Mercury retrogrades into your house of romance. Two eclipses earlier this month have made you focus on love and your relationships with friends. Don’t mistake the need for having a little independence with walking away from certain connections. If you need some down time, take it.

"
2441,20 july 2019,pisces,"People may be quite determined to get their way. If you try to do things your  way, they might accuse of you of failing to be a team player. Whatever. This is nothing to worry about, as cosmic activity over the next few days helps everyone lighten up.

"
2442,21 july 2019,pisces,"OK, it’s time to get the stardust out of your eyes and get real. The Sun will be entering the most efficient, practical part of your chart tomorrow. Today it forms a perfect line with realistic Mercury in your house of romance and creativity, telling you to be clear headed about love and your talents in the workplace. The good news is that over the next four weeks you’ll be able to make make headway in both areas.

"
2443,22 july 2019,pisces,"It’s kind of like New Year’s Day in July for members of your sign. The Sun is in Leo, your sixth house of habits and discipline. So if you fell off the wagon back around January 8th with your 2019 resolutions, now’s the time to get back on it. Diet and exercise regimens are especially favored as Leo governs your physique and vitality. Get organized at home and at the office too.

"
2444,23 july 2019,pisces,"With aggressive Mars in your can-do sixth house of efficiency, nothing is going to faze you. No project will be too large. No deadline will shatter your confidence. Hell, a boot camp exercise program will seem like an interesting challenge rather than something to run from. So get ready, Pisces. As they say in the movies: “All right men, I’m going in!”

"
2445,24 july 2019,pisces,"You’ve never been someone to hold back when it comes to chasing after a dream. But sometimes you just have to wait for the right cosmic energy to be in place to do so. Well Aries, a terrific Mercury-Venus link opens up doors. Get ready to walk through them.

"
2446,25 july 2019,pisces,"People need to know that you’re capable of making things happen, that you’ll move mountains if you have to. Fortunately you’ve got that “rainmaker” vibe going on thanks to a Jupiter-Mars trine. So don’t feel guilty about showing off. As long as you back up your words with solid action, you’re the one to watch….and trust.

"
2447,26 july 2019,pisces,"Team work makes the dream work? Yeah, that sounds  good, but is it really happening? The reality is that you may need to rally the troops and get people off their sorry asses. That won’t be a problem either, not with the fiery Sun and assertive Mars in the most efficient part of your chart. Just don’t become a tyrant in the process.

"
2448,27 july 2019,pisces,"Getting things done becomes a heck of a lot easier now that Venus is in your house of productivity. This includes stuff around the house and at the office, but also things like diet and fitness. Since Venus is all about beauty, there’s nothing with working out for the sole purpose of obtaining a revenge body.

"
2449,28 july 2019,pisces,"Sometimes we feel like we’re stuck. Moving forward seems so daunting, so draining. Yet if we make one tiny little adjustment it can act like a snowball rolling down a hill, gaining mass and momentum as it picks up speed. A Sun-Chiron aspect helps you identify that one little change and get going with it.

"
2450,29 july 2019,pisces,"Ouch! What what you say or out in writing, Pisces. Unpredictable Uranus is acting out in your house of self expression. Even if you are convinced that you are 100% correct about something, you still need to appear  to be a team player. Remember, appearances are everything.

"
2451,30 july 2019,pisces,"Anyone who tries to dump their work on you, or take advantage of your kind nature, is in for a big surprise. You’re not going to fall for it, but you’re not going to flip out either. Nope, you’re going to smile sweetly, wish them well, gracefully make an excuse and sashay away. They will be confused (good) and get stuck with their own problems (better).

"
2452,31 july 2019,pisces,"“Romeo, Romeo, wherefore ART thou, dude?” If your love life has been somewhat lackluster—or downright confusing–take heart. Mercury is now direct in the house of love. Single Pisces could meet someone new between now and August 11th. Couples can get back on the same page and miscommunication will end. (Wonder if Mercury was in retrograde when Juliet drank that fake poison. Probably. Classic, epic Mercury retro fail.)

"
2453,1 august 2019,pisces,"All talk and no action leads to a place called “Nowhere”. That’s the message behind today’s new moon in your house of productivity! It’s time to stop procrastinating and talking about the things that you intend  to do. Don’t let others pull you off track either, with their opinions and half-baked plans. Once Jupiter goes direct on August 11th things will develop momentum; make sure that you’re ready.

"
2454,2 august 2019,pisces,"Think before you speak, Pisces. Erratic Uranus is acting up in your communicating zone, which means that you could say or do something that you might regret. Try to play nice with others, even if they deserve to be blasted to the far side of the moon. Things turn around for you next week.

"
2455,3 august 2019,pisces,"Seek out people who know how to give, Pisces. There are far too many takers in the world. There is a lot of selfless, cooperative energy in your chart right now. Make sure the people in your circle deserve the kindness and generosity that you’re giving them.

"
2456,4 august 2019,pisces,"Get ready to rally the troops, Pisces. Over the next two weeks you’re going to be the one who gets everyone else in gear, starting today. This could be your family or friends. Maybe it’s a team at the office. If you sit around and wait for them to get inspired, you’ll be waiting for a long time….and you’ll end up doing all of the grunt work.

"
2457,5 august 2019,pisces,"The Moon governs our moods and emotions, which can be a good thing or a bad one! Fortunately La Luna is in a balanced place today, forming a solid aspect with Neptune in your sign. The entire week ahead has a practical vibe to it. It’s time to feel better about yourself inside, and that starts with logical thinking.

"
2458,6 august 2019,pisces,"Trying to get through to people using common sense may not work, but what can you do? Nothing. Erratic Uranus is making people full of themselves, unwilling to listen to sound advice. Don’t waste your time. Eventually they’ll figure things out for themselves, which could get messy. But that’s their path in life.

"
2459,7 august 2019,pisces,"Got #goals? Then you’re in luck, literally! Jupiter–the planet that’s famous for being generous–forms a fabulous aspect in your house of big dreams. It trines the Sun in your house of productivity. What this means is that if you’re willing to hustle, things are going to happen. Goodies won’t drop into your lap, but they’ll show up once you set things in motion.

"
2460,8 august 2019,pisces,"Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want in life, Pisces. It’s not selfish; it’s necessary! First of all, people aren’t mind readers. Second, your planetary aspects are smokin’ hot for actually getting what you desire. The goodies won’t be delivered to you on a silver platter but if you’re willing to put yourself out there, you ca obtain them.

"
2461,9 august 2019,pisces,"Before you make a promise to someone, make sure that you can deliver on it. This is just as true in love as it is in business, Pisces. Consider this though: isn’t it easier to make a promise to someone if they have similar values and goals as you? If you find yourself surrounded by people who are coming from another planet, maybe it’s time to reassess your connections.

"
2462,10 august 2019,pisces,"Are you trying to do too much? Then stop kidding yourself about what can be done in 24 hours. Or are you procrastinating like the worst slug on the planet? Then get off your sorry butt! A Sun-Neptune aspect is a wakeup call for being as productive as possible, without burning yourself out. This is super important as tomorrow brings three  big aspects that will push you to higher levels.

"
2463,11 august 2019,pisces,"Woo-hoo! Optimism and energy return as jovial Jupiter goes direct in your house of ambition and success. Sharp-as-a-tack Mercury glides into your efficiency sector, helping you cut through projects quickly. And Uranus starts to retrograde in your house of self-expression, which means that you need to think before you speak or take action.

"
2464,12 august 2019,pisces,"Best friends forever? Yes! a wonderful Saturn-Moon aspect solidifies your ties with good friends, and it might also introduce you to new people. This is great time to join a club or lend a hand to a volunteer organization. Joining an elite team within your industry (or a mastermind) is also a possibility. Oh, and friends could play matchmaker too!

"
2465,13 august 2019,pisces,"Things (and people) may not be what they seem today, so remain alert. Even if everything looks perfectly logical and correct, take your time to suss things out. Your intuition could be off today, but it’s right on point as of Thursday, so wait til then to use your Spidey sense.

"
2466,14 august 2019,pisces,"The couple that plays together stays together? You can reach your fitness goals more quickly if you and your lover agree  on a diet and exercise plan that involves you both. Of course, if your lover is into boot camp and you’re into ballet, you may need to find a sport that you both enjoy. Single Pisces, I almost hate to say this, but the gym (argh!) could actually be a good place to meet someone. I know that they are often meat markets but there could be a filet mignon in there somewhere.

"
2467,15 august 2019,pisces,"The full moon in Aquarius is here, and it’s your annual opportunity to “take out the trash”. You know: toxic people. Frenemies. A soul-sucking job. Your own bad habits. Poor dietary choices. Mental loops that focus on unhappy experiences from the past. The good news is that other planets will help you create (and stick to) better habits and choices. Just don’t tell the entire free world how done you are with everything, because some trolls may try to sabotage your efforts.

"
2468,16 august 2019,pisces,"Feeling hemmed in? That could be the case due to a Uranus-Mercury square. You just want to do your own thing and be at ease. The problem is that others have expectations. Should you fight this battle? Hmm….maybe not. Things start to get easier next week, so be a team player for now.

"
2469,17 august 2019,pisces,"You need people around you who are true blue, Pisces. Face it, you’re loyal and have depth of character. The people in your world should be the same way, otherwise you’ll end up becoming resentful. Make the right choices.

"
2470,18 august 2019,pisces,"Who loves ya, baby? That question will be on your mind in a big way over the next four weeks. Lusty, energetic Mars enters your commitment sector, firing up your love life. If you’re saying “what love life?” then get ready, because September is off the charts amazing for finding serious romance. Things start to heat up this week. Already attached? Things could go anywhere from really argumentative to incredible peaceful and rewarding. Just take it day by day.

"
2471,19 august 2019,pisces,"It’s not easy being so talented and efficient, but hey…you are! And other people may not like it one bit. That’s their problem. If they want to have your ability they should try working as hard as you do. You’ve earned it, honey. Don’t forget that.

"
2472,20 august 2019,pisces,"No matter how convincing someone may be, you cannot accept anything at face value today. People may be trying to get away from doing their fair share. Unless you want to get stuck doing their responsibility, walk away and let them handle it for themselves.

"
2473,21 august 2019,pisces,"Practical matters start to get shoved to the back burner now that amorous Venus is in your house of love. Make sure to schedule some quality time with your honey. Single Pisces are in an excellent position to meet someone new, and this is a keeper, not a player. This coming Saturday is especially favored for all Pisces when it comes to romance.

"
2474,22 august 2019,pisces,"The cosmos sends you a reality check, Pisces. You may think that you’re doing things the smartest way possible, but it appears that there’s room for improvement. Do you want to keep on getting the same results? No? Then switch things up.

"
2475,23 august 2019,pisces,"If you were hoping for some quiet time alone, you’d better grab it quickly. The Sun is entering your house of partnering with others and things are going to be quite busy over the next few weeks. That said, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to bond with a lover or meet someone new. Next week brings some unusual but happy surprises!

"
2476,24 august 2019,pisces,"Sparks fly as Mars and Venus are active in your commitment sector! It’s a good day for single Pisces to meet someone new (and all next week is good too, I might add). For those of you who are attached, this could be a passionate day. Keep drama to a minimum and focus on simply enjoying each others’ company.

"
2477,25 august 2019,pisces,"They say that in order to break the rules, first you must master them. That’s the energy on tap today, Pisces. What routines and rules should you stick with, and which ones need to go? Because cosmic energy later this week encourages you to start shaking things up.

"
2478,26 august 2019,pisces,"Things take a spontaneous turn as lively Uranus is in the mood for stirring up some fun. You could run into an old friend or meet the new love of your life. Maybe you’ll decide to take a few days off and play. Whatever transpires, it’s clear that you won’t be alone–so make plans with the people you care about!

2479,27 august 2019,pisces,"People could be quite demanding, expecting you to go along with their ideas or plans. But a lunar aspect is making you more interested in doing your own thing. Don’t be afraid to tell them no, and expect to get some flak for it. For what it’s worth your “thing” is a lot more fun and relaxed.

"
2480,28 august 2019,pisces,"Compromises may be necessary but they could happen a lot more easily than you’d expect. A terrific Mars-Uranus aspect opens up lines of communication.

But something unexpected could happen, something that will put smile on your face. It could be a job offer, a raise or idea for a business that can take your net worth to the next level. Be observant and ready to pounce.

"
2677,8 september 2018,aries,"This is not a good day to push your agenda! Venus and Mars are at cross purposes to each other. Try to remain as diplomatic as possible in all of your key relationships. Once Morris changes signs on Monday, teamwork will be back in place.

"
2678,9 september 2018,aries,"Love and money are always on everyone’s mind, and today’s new moon falls in your house of sex, deep emotions and net worth! Yup, that’s quite a loaded sector in astrology and a new moon only occurs here once a year. But you won’t be in fantasy land when it comes to either; on the contrary, you’re going to be taking a practical approach.

"
2679,10 september 2018,aries,"It’s not what you know, but whom you know that counts. Now that red hot Mars is in your house of networking, you should be making an effort to meet as many people as possible. Start reaching out to people from your past as well. You never know who might be able to help you….or how this could change your love life.

"
2680,11 september 2018,aries,"Teamwork counts for a lot today, whether it’s in your personal or professional life. Show people that you are willing to cooperate, and you will find that they are too. This sends a message to highers-up that you are the best person for the job. And it lets a lover know that you are concerned about their needs, but you also demand to be treated like equal.

"
2681,12 september 2018,aries,"If you want to make progress today, speak from the heart. Naturally this will work in your personal relationships, but it can also work at the office. Don’t expect people to be mind readers; they need to know what you’re thinking.

"
2682,13 september 2018,aries,"It could be hard to separate fact from fantasy today, Aries. Deceptive Neptune is active, indicating that other people could be dishing out a lot of BS. The other problem is that your own subconscious mind and intuition could be off. Obviously this is not a good day for making decisions, or saying anything that you might regret later. Hold off.

"
2683,14 september 2018,aries,"This will be a tense day for all signs of the zodiac as over half the solar system is snarling at each other. In your case, it’s friends, lovers and kids who could be acting out. Cooperation will be hard to come by and and tempers could flare. Tomorrow is a much better day for setting boundaries and letting people know that you expect more from them.

"
2684,15 september 2018,aries,"Whistle while you work? It worked for the seven dwarfs, and now it can work for you. You’ll be able to tackle chores like a hot knife cutting through a cold stick of butter. But just don’t clean out the basement or organize your sock drawer. This energy is too to good to waste, so use it to streamline your business practices.

"
2685,16 september 2018,aries,"Need to butter someone up? Make a good impression? Then start talking, Aries, as the cosmic energy is perfect for that. To your surprise others may be willing to do things your way. But you won’t find out unless you try.

"
2686,17 september 2018,aries,"You mean business, and it’s time to show it. This is just as true in your personal life as it is in your professional one. This could mean putting people on notice about your plans or boundaries. But it could also mean finally doing some of the things on your bucket list that have been on there for way too long!

"
2687,18 september 2018,aries,"Tempers could flare with a Mars-Uranus square. It seems that everyone is out for themselves today, not willing to be a team player. As a result, don’t expect people to follow the rules for the roles that have been assigned to them. Tomorrow is a much better day for gaining cooperation.

"
2688,19 september 2018,aries,"Don’t make things so complicated, ram. It’s time to wrap up all of the little things that have been cluttering up your to-do list for way too long. There is a reason why people value simplicity. It brings serenity.

"
2689,20 september 2018,aries,"You’ve been incredibly busy lately, and chances are your batteries are running a little low. It’s a good time to evaluate your health. Are you pain free and fit? Are you bubbling over with energy? If the answer is no, you need to create some better habits.

"
2690,21 september 2018,aries,"No man or woman is an island, no matter how much they want to be! Over the next four weeks it’s critical to play nice with others. Communicative Mercury is now in your partnership sector, making it easier to express your opinions to the people closest to you. But remember this: it’s a two-way street.

"
2691,22 september 2018,aries,"Time to partner up? The cosmos seems to think so. The Sun enters your commitment sector today, joining Mercury. It will be a balancing act over the next four weeks to meet your needs and those of others. Your career could be demanding too, placing pressure on your personal time. That said, you really can have a lot of fun!

"
2692,23 september 2018,aries,"Cooperation counts, Aries. If you’re willing to be a team player, things will go much more smoothly. Even if you think that you have to take over a situation…even if you know you are 100% correct…you still need to give others the freedom to say and do what they have in mind.

"
2693,24 september 2018,aries,"Oh happy day! There’s a beautiful full moon in the sky tonight and has your name written all over it. Something important to you, something that you may have been working on since the time of your birthday, may finally come to pass. But remember to be diplomatic when dealing with other people. You may need their help in the future more than you realize.

"
2694,25 september 2018,aries,"Should I stay or should I go? A tense Sun-Saturn square could make you wonder if you should remain in a job or relationship. This is especially true if you feel as though you’re being stifled or controlled. Over the next two weeks, you will probably be making your decision.

"
2695,26 september 2018,aries,"You may need to adjust your expectations when it comes to love and money. It’s one thing to be optimistic and another to be wearing rose colored glasses. Make sure that you’re taking a realistic view. Thursday is a good time to make sure that your goals, values and ideas are aligned.

"
2696,27 september 2018,aries,"What do you bring to the table, ram? As it turns out, plenty! Don’t be surprised if people want to meet and associate with you. You’re in a fabulous position to expand your social network, and if you’re smart you will.

"
2697,28 september 2018,aries,"It’s time to release emotional baggage, ram. Past traumas, fears and concerns… all of these have to go. And the only one who can do this is you. If you need the help of a friend or therapist seek it out. But at the end of the day, it’s up to you to do the inner work.

"
2698,29 september 2018,aries,"It may seem as though people are talking in circles today. So if you need to, demand straight answers. You have too much going on to sit around and figure out what they’re thinking or doing. If you can be clear, so can they.

"
2699,30 september 2018,aries,"Pluto is in an excellent angle in your ambition sector, allowing you to plow ahead with things that are important to you. This is the planet of transformation, so you can now put things in motion that may have been on hold. In the process you will become a different person.

"
2700,1 october 2018,aries,"Someone may demand that you stick to the rules today, and if you’re smart you will. This is not a time to be a rebel. To be honest, the other individual maybe on some kind of power trip. But if you don’t play nice they could make your life miserable.

"
2701,2 october 2018,aries,"Your sign is famous for being frank and open, but this is not a good time to speak your mind. Nor should you mouth off to people, especially if they are authority figures. This is true even if people are on power trips and want to push you (and others) around. Wait until the new Moon next Monday, a much better time for being blunt.

"
2702,3 october 2018,aries,"Awww!!!!  You could feel all warm and fuzzy today, Aries. With the Moon and Venus in the most sensitive, nostalgic parts of your chart you should be reminiscing. And dreaming. And telling someone how much you love them. Or fantasizing about someone new coming into your life. By the way, this could actually happen as of the new Moon on Monday.

"
2703,4 october 2018,aries,"Writer’s block, feeling stuck, confused about which direction to go in….this can happen today with a Moon-Uranus square. And you could get quite annoyed too! This energy could last for up to a week, but you should be out of the woods by Thuesday the 11th.

"
2704,5 october 2018,aries,"Venus begins to retrograde in your house of intimacy and deep emotions. This could stir up drama ad jealousy. Confusion about your emotions could be rampant. An ex could come back into your life. This energy will last through mid-November, so buckle up your seat belts.

"
2705,6 october 2018,aries,"Don’t believe everything you hear, Aries! People could be out to flatter or manipulate you. And with the Moon in a sensitive spot you could fall for it. But now that you’ve read your horoscope, you’re one step ahead of them!

"
2706,7 october 2018,aries,"It’s not your role in life to bail everyone out of their never-ending problems. It’s one thing to be helpful to others, and another to get dumped on. Leave martyrdom to the saints.

"
2707,8 october 2018,aries,"Today’s new Moon can solidify your relationships with others in a wonderful way, in business and in your personal life. Single and looking? This is the best time all year to find a keeper. But a Moon-Uranus square warns that you must keep your financial expectations with these people clear.

"
2708,9 october 2018,aries,"Now that Mercury is in Scorpio, you may want to keep things under wraps. Scorpio is a secretive sign. The entire free world doesn’t need to know what you’re thinking or working on. But do open up to your lover, as this is a wonderful aspect for building a stronger bond.

"
2709,10 october 2018,aries,"Emotions will be raw today, on your part and that of others. Which means that you need to be mindful about what you say and do. In matters of the heart, don’t push too hard in order to get things done your way: it could backfire big time.

"
2710,11 october 2018,aries,"Yesterday was not an easy one, and tomorrow looks tense also! But today is a good time to speak your piece. Stop sucking it up; be authoritative but calm. People may not be used to you taking control of situations, but they’d better get used to it!

"
2711,12 october 2018,aries,"People could be contentious today, unwilling to cooperate. But fortunately for you, calm Mercury will help keep your emotions in check. Next week will be far better for seizing control of situations—and I do mean “seize”!

"
2712,13 october 2018,aries,"Like the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz, you may be all twisted up, not knowing which direction to head in. The good news is that the Moon moves into the most decisive part of your chart tomorrow, and you’ll be able to come to a decision. This energy lasts through Tuesday so you’ll have several days to run with it.

"
2713,14 october 2018,aries,"Great day for making long term decisions about the future! Locking in smart new habits is also favored. What’s the reason? The passionate Moon lines up perfectly with mature, disciplined Saturn in your house of goals and success.

"
2714,15 october 2018,aries,"Let it all hang out! No, not your private parts. Your feelings. Today is a bit on the mushy side as gentle Venus sidles up next to chatty Mercury in the heavens. Don’t be afraid to express yourself.

"
2715,16 october 2018,aries,"Anyone who has been underestimating you is in for a big surprise. You’re becoming more determined every day, thanks to transformational Pluto in a powerful position. But don’t beat people over the head with your newfound attitude; let them find out slowly what’s going on!

"
2716,17 october 2018,aries,"The Moon in Aquarius should put you in quite the social mood. The next four days are excellent for networking. But be selective about the people you hang out with and what you share; you don’t want your private business splashed all over social media.

"
2717,18 october 2018,aries,"Dreams often cost money. No secret there, right? But you could get a reality check as you realize that some of your plans need a lot more dinero. Fortunately the Sun enters your house of wealth next Tuesday.

"
2718,19 october 2018,aries,"It’s a wonderful day to let your feelings and thoughts flow! Verbal Mercury is in a great aspect with passionate Neptune.

"
2726,27 october 2018,aries,"Do what you have to do to impress muckety mucks today. You may think that your talents are on view for everyone to see already. But people are busy, and they don’t notice everything. It’s time for a little self-promotion.

"
2727,28 october 2018,aries,"Tell the truth today, even if certain people don’t like it. With the Moon in the most communicative part of your chart, you should be able to dole out words in an eloquent manner. Sometimes you just have to tell it like it is.

2728,29 october 2018,aries,"It’s a wonderful day to open up and let people know how you feel. Verbal Mercury meets up with abundant Jupiter in the heavens, creating terrific circumstances for speaking your mind. Don’t worry about whether you can trust people not with your words.

"
2732,2 november 2018,aries,"No matter how confusing people or situations maybe, you need to stay calm, cool and collected. Part of the problem is that you are in a very practical mood these days. You are able to see things clearly. Why can’t everyone else be as direct?

"
2733,3 november 2018,aries,"Pay attention to your own wisdom and stop worrying about what other people have to say. Truth be told, they could be trying to steer you in the wrong direction. All the more reason to follow your own true North.

"
2734,4 november 2018,aries,"Do something that pushes you past your existing boundaries today, Aries. From your chart it appears that you’ve gotten comfortable….way too comfortable. With Jupiter getting ready to enter the most adventurous part of your chart this week, it’s time for change.

"
2735,5 november 2018,aries,"Your imagination and intuition are in high gear today. And with so much activity in the most psychological part of your chart, you could be feeling quite emotional.

"
2757,28 november 2018,aries,"You’re stepping into a powerful place, and no one will be able to stop you! But that doesn’t mean that you need to rub everyone’s noses in it.

"
2764,5 december 2018,aries,"Your intuition could be off today, so don’t count on it being accurate. Stick with the facts instead. People could be running around spouting some high falutin’ ideas, so take everything you hear with a grain of salt.

2778,20 december 2018,aries,"You might do something unexpected today, but this is a good thing! The cosmos is pushing you to take more chances, even if you are  one of the most adventurous signs of the zodiac. Even if an idea seems all-out crazy, it may have substance, so don’t ignore it.

"
2779,21 december 2018,aries,"The Sun zips into Capricorn, your house of ambition and success. Chances are you’ll be thinking big and bold, because abundant Jupiter and intelligent Mercury are shaking hands in your house of adventure. Why not make 2019 the year that everything changed?

"
2780,22 december 2018,aries,"The Cancer full moon is all about family, love and being happy at home. Some major changes or decisions could be made over the next two weeks. You won’t be content to do things the same old way, that’s for sure!

"
2781,23 december 2018,aries,"Some of the things you’ve been thinking about lately are pretty intense. Nothing wrong with that, but don’t act on them just yet. Wait until New Year’s Eve, when Mars enters your sign.

"
2782,24 december 2018,aries,"Say little and observe a lot. What people are saying and what they’re thinking are two different things. Confronting them won’t work. Instead, chill out and let things unfold, which will happen by the time the week is over.
 
 

"
2783,25 december 2018,aries,"Happy holidays, Aries! The Moon in Leo makes for a fun, frisky day. Leo governs children, so this is a wonderful day to play with them. Or you can get in touch with your inner child……where ARE those finger paints, anyway?

"
2784,26 december 2018,aries,"Feeling spunky? You should be! Spontaneous Uranus is active in your sign, and it’s winking at the Moon in frisky Leo. Chuck your responsibilities and go off to have some fun today. You deserve it.

"
2785,27 december 2018,aries,"If you feel like pulling away from the world and resting, that’s okay. Mars is spending a few last days in the house of the subconscious mind. On New Year’s Eve it will be entering Aries, which means that it’s showtime. Recharge your batteries now.

"
2786,28 december 2018,aries,"Something to happen over the next week that could increase your status immensely. But this doesn’t mean that you should swagger about. On the contrary. Keep things low key. You’ll attract even more attention by remaining humble.

"
2787,29 december 2018,aries,"The past few weeks may not have been easy. Mars has been touring your house of the subconscious mind, stirring up the waters. The red planet is getting ready to leave on New Year’s Eve. But today it forms a fabulous aspect with Chiron, the wounded healer. Let go of all of the mental chunk that has been holding you back.

"
2788,30 december 2018,aries,"You may have reached your limit with a certain situation or person. If that’s the case, I wish them a lot of luck! Once Mars enters your sign tomorrow, you’ll be leaving a lot of things—and people– behind you in the dust.

"
2789,31 december 2018,aries,"Woohoo!!  Red hot Mars enters Aries today, kicking off 2019 in style. Mars is the planet of getting things done. When it’s in your sign, it slaps rocket boosters onto your ambition. Take this energy and run with it!

"
2790,28 january 2018,taurus,"Simplicity, feeling more grounded, practical initiatives–now’s the time to take a rational and streamlined approach to all areas of your life now that Mars is in Aries. This is also one of your best opportunities in 2017 to start earning more, so dust off your resume, ask for a promotion or develop a new income stream for your business.

"
2791,8 march 2018,taurus,"What exactly do you need from a romantic partnership, Taurus? Jupiter starts to retrograde today in your commitment sector, which also deals with business alliances. Over the next four months you can mull this over. Jupiter is a philosophical planet, prone to deep thought. It’s generous and abundant too, so think about how to truly enjoy your personal or professional life with another person.

"
2792,9 march 2018,taurus,"Are you putting enough money aside for the future, Taurus? Heaven knows that you love the finer things in life, but you can’t be indulging in them without a thought for “rainy days” ahead. Stop emotional spending and just buy the basics.

"
2793,10 march 2018,taurus,"You run the risk of counting your chickens before they hatch, Taurus. Remember that many important things in life take time to manifest. Deluding yourself may result in making mistakes. Also, avoid the tendency to put someone on a pedestal. They may not deserve it!

"
2794,11 march 2018,taurus,"Projects or plans could go off the rails as people slack or refuse to follow the rules. It may be hard to figure out the next step, which could also be part of the problem. Clarity returns tomorrow, so wait 24 hours before making key decisions.

"
2795,12 march 2018,taurus,"A quiet yet passionate attraction could be brewing, Taurus, so be prepared to turn heads! If you’re happily involved with someone, today rocks for sizzling encounters behind closed doors. There’s a rather spontaneous vibe going on, so switch things up a bit (if you get my drift!).

"
2796,13 march 2018,taurus,"No need to be a stubborn bull today! A sweet Sun-Jupiter aspect allows you to work seamlessly with others, whether it’s at the office or in your personal life. You’ll be able to achieve more in the next few weeks if you team up with others and seek their input.

"
2797,14 march 2018,taurus,"Avoid petty arguments today, as they simply aren’t worth it. With the Moon in the most authoritative (read: “bossy”) part of your chart you may be itching to point out someone’s failings. Let it go. Tomorrow is a much better time to get back in agreement with people.

"
2798,15 march 2018,taurus,"Group activities are going to pick up steam in the months ahead, and you may be on the verge of meeting some exciting new people to team up with. From your chart it’s clear that you need to be around movers and shakers, not people whose thinking is still in the 1980s.

"
2799,16 march 2018,taurus,"Your creativity is off the charts with a Moon-Neptune meet-up. If you’re part of a team effort, share your insight with the group as your input is worthwhile. Working solo? Then you might want to run your ideas past a trusted friend or mentor.

"
2800,17 march 2018,taurus,"One of the most visionary periods in years opens up for you today, Taurus. First, there will be a new moon in the sector that deals with networking and team efforts. Then red hot Mars enters your house of philosophy, thinking big and long distance travel. Join a mastermind group, put together an entrepreneurial startup and crowdsource, book an exciting foreign vacation with your lover/tribe or apply to grad school. The sky’s the limit!

"
2801,18 march 2018,taurus,"Who needs critics or frenemies? Not you, Taurus, so don’t put up with it. Your intuition is spot on these days, so if you doubt someone’s loyalty or agenda, chances are you’re on target.

"
2802,19 march 2018,taurus,"Reaching out and helping others is in the stars for your sign, and it’s probably in your heart as well. Whether you lend your time and effort to a worthy cause or lend a shoulder to a friend, you’ll be making the world a better place.

"
2803,20 march 2018,taurus,"The Sun enters the most secretive part of your chart today, and this year the energy is more hush-hush than usual. That’s because Mercury will go retrograde in this sector later in the week. Your intuition may be off, making it hard to separate fact from fiction. Say little and observe a lot.

"
2804,21 march 2018,taurus,"You need to recharge your batteries, Taurus. From your chart it appears that you’ve been pushing yourself too hard. Start by “unplugging” your mind and letting your worries go, if only for a few days. Over the next few weeks it would be smart to meditate, journal or spend more time relaxing at home.

"
2805,22 march 2018,taurus,"Fire up the old BS meter. Over the next few weeks you may be dealing with people who have hidden agendas, people who might want to work at cross purposes to you. Mercury is now retrograde in the house of secrets and your intuition may be off. Don’t forget–you possess a very logical left brain.

"
2806,23 march 2018,taurus,"You’re in a dreamy state of mind, but this could lead to illogical thinking. Keep it real, Taurus. Your sign is known for being level headed but you run the risk of getting flattered or even conned by someone.

"
2807,25 march 2018,taurus,"Getting along well with others can actually happen today, despite the stinky cosmic aspects that have been around lately. Your opinions may differ from the people you live and work with, but there is still some common ground there if you seek it out.

"
2808,26 march 2018,taurus,"No matter how kind you are, regardless of how direct or fair you are, people seem hell bent on taking your words the wrong way. This vibe will be in play all week, so get used to it! Remember that it’s their problem, not yours. Things get better on Saturday when Venus enters your sign.

"
2809,27 march 2018,taurus,"Your sign is famous for being sturdy and dependable, but that doesn’t mean that you have to take on everyone’s problems. If this is a role that you feel is karmic, or that you’re the only one who can do it, then get over yourself. It’s time to let others figure things out for themselves.

"
2810,29 march 2018,taurus,"Appearances can be deceiving, Taurus. In your optimism don’t assume that everyone has your back or shares your dreams. This means that you need to watch how much intel you reveal. Wait a few days for better cosmic energy.

"
2811,30 march 2018,taurus,"You’ve been a good friend and confidante to other people, but are you being treated the same way in return? Make sure that you’re not carrying too much of a burden by being that good friend. Surround yourself by people who support you.

"
2812,31 march 2018,taurus,"Adventure meets up with practicality at the time of today’s full moon. Wrap up unfinished projects at home and at work. Then get ready to take some risks, pushing past your old ideas of what you’re capable of. Venus enters your sign today too: perfect time for a makeover!

"
2813,1 april 2018,taurus,"Both the right and left sides of your brain are crushing it today, Taurus! So let your creativity rip along with practicality and wisdom. It’s a smart time to tuck yourself away and do some thinking, if only for an hour or two.

"
2814,2 april 2018,taurus,"How much should you reveal? Impatient Mars wants you to get it all out there, while mature Saturn tells you to parse your words. Stay on the smart side and just say what is necessary, nothing more.

"
2815,3 april 2018,taurus,"It’s time to partner up with people who share your ideas and talent level, Taurus. Sure, you can try to go it alone but you’ll enjoy the journey more if you have company along the way.

"
2816,4 april 2018,taurus,"Red hot Mars is making you more adventurous than usual, but this may not be beneficial! Problem is, Mercury is off key in your house of intuition. If your gut is telling you to do something, you should give it a few days first. Make sure to use the logical side of your mind too.

"
2817,5 april 2018,taurus,"Both your physical and mental energy may be taking a hit this week, so it’s imperative to chill out and relax. Otherwise you’re looking at major burnout! Don’t worry, all of your projects can wait a few days.

"
2818,6 april 2018,taurus,"You have an independent streak a mile wide but at some point you need to ask for help. Today’s a good time to start. You might discover, to your surprise, that someone is supporting you from behind the scenes. By all means let them help you.

"
2819,7 april 2018,taurus,"You can plan all you want but at some point ya just gotta get some sh** done, Taurus. Today’s an excellent time to swing into action. Wise old Saturn has your back, preventing you from doing anything too stupid. Get some momentum going.

"
2820,8 april 2018,taurus,"The pieces of a plan or project will start to come together this week, and if you’re smart you’ll get other people involved if you haven’t already. Just make sure that you know where they’re coming from. Do they truly have your best interest at heart, or their’s?

"
2821,9 april 2018,taurus,"Venus is in your sign, pushing you to boost your confidence with a little makeover magic. But the Moon may make you question whether it’s worth the trouble. It is, so stop sulking and get on with it!

"
2822,10 april 2018,taurus,"With the moon in the most sensitive part of your chart you could be feeling quite emo! Furthermore people could be talking out of both sides of their mouth. Listen to what they say but don’t make any major decisions right now.

"
2823,11 april 2018,taurus,"Someone has the gift of gab and they may use it to try to flatter you into getting what they want. But yo’ mama didn’t raise no fool, so smile sweetly and glide casually to the nearest exit.

"
2824,12 april 2018,taurus,"Luscious Venus is currently transiting your sign, amping up your charisma. So don’t be surprised if you’re attracting admirers and people who want a little of that magic to rub off on them! But if you’re still feeling down on yourself despite this energy, then consider a makeover. It’s the best time in 2018 to go for it.

"
2825,13 april 2018,taurus,"The new few years of your life could be quite adventurous, if you let it be! An optimistic Jupiter-Pluto aspect suggests that you surround yourself with people who have the vision to see things that others can’t, folks who aren’t afraid of putting themselves out there.

"
2826,14 april 2018,taurus,"Sometimes we get so beaten down by the daily grind that it’s hard to think on a lofty level. But you’ll be able to do that today, as Mars and Neptune are both active in the most visionary parts of your chart. That view from 30,000 feet can be quite illuminating.

"
2827,15 april 2018,taurus,"The next 48 hours are probably the best time in 2018 to toss things (or people!) that are no longer working for you, Taurus. Mercury has been retrograding through your house of endings for the last three weeks, making you more aware that closure is necessary. It moves direct today, so start taking out the trash.

"
2828,16 april 2018,taurus,"The long dark night of the soul is coming to an end, Taurus. For the past seven years you’ve experienced rebellious Uranus transiting through the house of your subconscious mind. Most likely it stirred up all sorts of childhood memories and not-so-pleasant ones of romances gone sour. Uranus will be leaving this sector on May 15th, but you can put an end to the drama right now with today’s new moon in the house of closure and transition.

"
2829,17 april 2018,taurus,"Big plans may get put on hold as Saturn retrogrades in your house of travel, education, entrepreneurship and taking risks. Or maybe you simply need to go back and revisit your MO. Over the next few months make sure that everything you put out there is perfect: marketing materials, your resume, a college application, thesis, art portfolio, business plan, product design, you name it.

"
2830,18 april 2018,taurus,"Sometimes healing ourselves emotionally can take years (on a therapists’s couch, no less). But at other times change can happen in a flash, and today is one of them. A brilliant Sun-Uranus connection helps you realize disempowering thoughts (and get rid of them) in a heartbeat.

"
2831,19 april 2018,taurus,"Adventure is calling your name, Taurus, so why not put yourself out there and take a smart risk? Life’s too short to be stuck in a familiar old groove, no mater how comfortable it might be. This may require changing the image you have of yourself first, but change will do you good.

"
2832,20 april 2018,taurus,"It’s showtime! Happy birthday, Taurus. This year won’t be like any you’ve experienced before in your lifetime. Brilliant, eccentric Uranus glides into your sign on May 15th, a place it hasn’t been since 1942. Over the next eight years you can completely reinvent your life and experience moments of sheer genius. Ready for a revolution?

"
2833,21 april 2018,taurus,"Red hot Mars is riling you up, pushing you to go after some pretty wild dreams. Which is fine, so long as you don’t burn yourself out in the process. You also run the risk of over promising and not being able to deliver, something that could cause you to lose face. Slow down and do things right.

"
2834,22 april 2018,taurus,"A phoenix rising from the ashes. That’s the image you should keep in mind about yourself, Taurus. Subterranean Pluto goes retrograde in your house of taking risks, challenging you to break away from an old self-image that doesn’t suit you anymore. This may mean “setting fire” to the past, but how else are you going to be transformed?

"
2835,23 april 2018,taurus,"Got a case of wanderlust? The planets are pulling you toward the airport. Distant lands are calling your name. But before you can take off into the great blue yonder, you may need to take care of things at home. Do that and then start trawling the travel blogs.

"
2836,24 april 2018,taurus,"Feel like splurging on yourself? That’s a ridiculous question to ask a Taurus! Of course you do. Now you have the cosmos’s permission to do so—Venus just entered your house of spending and luxury. Don’t go crazy and don’t go broke, but make sure that you get a nice treat (or two).

"
2837,25 april 2018,taurus,"Lofty thinking is usually a good thing, provided that it’s offset by careful planning. But today you may be too impatient to get things off the ground. Another issue is that your intuition appears to be off, all the more reason to slow down.

"
2838,26 april 2018,taurus,"Feel like things are starting to move at warp speed in your life? Or are you trying hard to push things along so that momentum increases? Red hot Mars meets up with power broker Pluto, demanding that things be done, and “I wanted them yesterday.” Whether this is a smart move or not is another issue. Be wary of trying to reach a destination too quickly; it might backfire.

"
2839,27 april 2018,taurus,"This is not a good time to play games or do something behind the backs of other people, Taurus. You might also be keeping information from someone in an attempt to protect them or not upset them. Trust me, they’ll be even more upset if they find out that you held back. No good deed goes unpunished, right?

"
2840,28 april 2018,taurus,"Just because someone has a crazy ass idea doesn’t mean that you need to buy into it! Likewise, no matter how brilliant you may think your ideas are, others may not see it that way. But that shouldn’t stop you from pursuing grand schemes. Just don’t count on others to participate.

"
2841,29 april 2018,taurus,"You’re in an excellent spot to take a smart risk, something that has long lasting consequences. Consider who might be able to help you along the way— a mentor, friend, lover, relative or business connection. This is one of your best years in a decade to partner up with others. Don’t feel that you have to go it alone.

"
2842,30 april 2018,taurus,"A sizzling full moon occurs in your commitment zone, and this is good news for love! Singles, over the next two weeks you could meet a series suitor. Both online dating sites and networking face to face at get togethers could pay off handsomely. Coupled up bulls should be planning a romantic vacation with lusty Mars active in your travel zone.

"
2843,1 may 2018,taurus,"The planets are pushing you to be more of a team player:  in romance, your family life and at the office. But there’s a hint of rebellion coming from your subconscious mind. You need to ask yourself if this desire to pull away is based on something real and logical, or if it’s just ego and emotions that are pushing your buttons.

"
2844,2 may 2018,taurus,"You’re a rock solid soul, not known for getting thrown off balance easily. But you can be bull-headed from time to time, and today is one of those days! This is a tendency you’re going to have to watch over the next two weeks. The 7th, 8th and 12th all have this energy, so make sure that you don’t offend the wrong people.

"
2845,3 may 2018,taurus,"You’re about to enter one of the most fast-paced, transformational periods of your life come mid-May. Now is a good time to consider which risks you’d like to take over the next eight years! The good news is that you won’t be going in where angels fear to tread. Your choices will be smart ones, a bit daring but still logical.

"
2846,4 may 2018,taurus,"There are people who say that rules are meant to be broken, but is that really the case? Your sign is usually pretty settled on following a particular path, but over the next few weeks you may be questioning some of the rules that have been running your life.

"
2847,5 may 2018,taurus,"Is there something that you’ve been dreaming about doing for years? And for some reason, you never felt like you had the chops to go after it? Powerful Pluto is telling you to man up (or woman up!) and go for it. You have a lot more going for you than you realize.

"
2848,6 may 2018,taurus,"Some interesting new contacts could come your way, so don’t lock yourself at home today! It’s a great time to join a club or volunteer effort. Friends could play matchmaker. New BFFs are out there, just looking for someone to party with. What are you waiting for?

"
2849,7 may 2018,taurus,"Getting to the bottom of things could be mighty difficult with today’s confusing planetary aspects. People could resort to flattery, arm twisting or passive aggressive behavior. With the Sun in your sign you may be tempted to run them over, but hold back.

"
2850,8 may 2018,taurus,"It’s critical to make sure that you and a partner (romantic or otherwise) are on the same page. Jupiter, planet of abundance and optimism, is hitting you with a heavy dose of unrealistic thinking. With next week’s new moon in your sign, you need to get clear about whether or not the people in your orbit share your views and plans.

"
2851,9 may 2018,taurus,"Pull people into your plans, Taurus. You’re in one of the most productive, free-thinking periods of your life, able to move mountains with your thoughts and words. A terrific lunar aspect today suggests that you seek the wisdom of others…or take them along for the ride!

"
2852,10 may 2018,taurus,"Hmmm….does that “platonic” friend or business contact want to be more than that? Could be with a romantic Moon-Neptune connection! Unless you’re ready to go down that path, you need to keep things professional.

"
2853,11 may 2018,taurus,"You may have been holding back when it comes to taking risks, Taurus. That’s about to change big time thanks to dynamic Pluto getting rid of your fear factor. Don’t worry, you won’t do anything stupid. Logical Saturn has your back. If in doubt, run ideas past a mentor.

"
2854,12 may 2018,taurus,"Your calculations about how long it will take something to get done seem to be way  off, Taurus! The same holds true for how expensive it will be, the amount of risk involved and the final expected outcome. Fortunately shrewd Mercury enters your sign tomorrow, bringing some much needed clarity.

"
2855,13 may 2018,taurus,"Chatty Mercury is now in Taurus, making it far easier to get your point across. Run ideas past people and open up the lines of communication. This is not time to be shy about your desires or plans. You’ve been in the shadows for too long.

"
2856,14 may 2018,taurus,"Out with the old, in with the new! Today is like the mother of all New Year’s Eve parties, Taurus. Uranus enters your sign tomorrow, a major life event. But before it goes it makes one last sweep through your psyche, decluttering mental debris and encouraging you to toss old baggage.

"
2857,15 may 2018,taurus,"The spotlight is on you, Taurus! Uranus is now in your sign for the first time since 1942. Over the next eight years your self-image, goals and attitude will do a complete 180. There will be periods of intense activity and progress followed by slow times, so pace yourself.

"
2858,16 may 2018,taurus,"Make a wish and blow out the birthday candles, Taurus! Your annual new moon just occurred, and this is the best time in 2018 to refine your wishes for the year ahead—and then go after them. Tomorrow Mars enters your goals sector, so nothing—and I mean nothing—is going to stop you.

"
2859,17 may 2018,taurus,"Wild card Uranus has been in your sign for only 48 hours and it’s already shaking things up! Today you might feel like rebelling—against the system, a boss or someone whom you feel is holding you back. Watch your tongue for now! Once diplomatic Venus flies into your communication sector on Saturday, you’ll be able to get your point across.

"
2860,18 may 2018,taurus,"Your sign is known for being steadfast to the point of being cautious. And today a superb Mercury-Saturn trine enables you to put yourself out there, taking a risk, without compromising too much. Logical Saturn will help you move forward without doing something stupid!

"
2861,19 may 2018,taurus,"Spread your wings, social butterfly! Venus enters your house of networking, so be prepared to party. That’s no problem for your luxe-loving sign. The next three weeks are also super for a personal makeover, as Uranus, the planet of change, high-fives Venus today too. Go and get your glam on.

"
2862,20 may 2018,taurus,"One of the most prosperous times of 2018 begins today thanks to the Sun entering your house of income and security. Use the next four weeks to promote yourself as strongly as you can. Venus is now in your house of self-expression and promotion, helping to advertise your brand and show off your talents.

"
2863,21 may 2018,taurus,"You may be a stubborn creature of habit but the cosmos is telling you to switch things up a bit! Specifically, the planets are telling you to plan some exciting vacations to far off destinations. This has an extra benefit, other than the standard rest and relaxation. The more you’re exposed to different cultures and fresh ideas, the faster your mind will grow.

"
2864,22 may 2018,taurus,"No man or woman is an island and you can truly benefit by allowing new people into your inner circle. You might end up being surprised at how these connections will expand your mind and add more “juice” in your life.

"
2865,23 may 2018,taurus,"Close relationships need to be handled with rational thinking, not the wishful kind. A Mercury-Jupiter opposition could make either you or someone else unrealistic about where things are heading. This is true in business as well as love, so keep it real in all areas of your life.

"
2866,24 may 2018,taurus,"With aggressive Mars blazing a path through your ambition sector, you are a force of nature these days! The red planet forms a trine, the best possible angle in astrology, with the fiery Sun. Don’t hold back— be courageous—and ask for what you want. If the door is closed, then kick open another one.

"
2867,25 may 2018,taurus,"A rare Jupiter-Neptune trine sets the stage for meeting new people, developing relationships that can take you to exciting places in your life. The smartest thing that you can do is to get out there and connect face to face, and be open to people with different philosophies and backgrounds.

Pluto is the planet that governs our personal awareness and power, and it’s helping you change your perspective about what’s possible.

"
2869,27 may 2018,taurus,"Someone may be unusually critical today, so don’t be too thin skinned. This person may be a stickler for following the rules, or they live in a world where they’re afraid of taking chances. Remember that that’s their problem, not your’s.

"
2870,28 may 2018,taurus,"Protecting your emotional “territory” could be an issue with a tense Moon-Mercury opposition. The full moon tomorrow takes place in one of the sectors that deals with feelings and psychological issues, so this isn’t entirely surprising! But before you vent and say things you may regret, hold back a bit.

"
2871,29 may 2018,taurus,"Unless your name is Oprah, you’re undoubtedly looking to build up your net worth. Then you’ll love tonight’s full moon in the “big money” part of your chart.

Mercury pops into your income sector, telling you to start building wealth by earning and saving more.

"

"
2970,7 september 2018,taurus,"Today is a winner on many fronts! Your charisma is high and so is your creativity.

Don’t waste this precious energy.

"
2971,8 september 2018,taurus,"You have to learn how to crawl before you learn how to walk. Things take time! And if you try to run too far too fast, you risk falling down. Don’t let anyone convince you to jump into something if you’re not ready. And don’t put too much pressure on yourself either.

The next two months are awesome for making progress on achieving dreams that are close to your heart.

Fortunately with intelligent Mars and Virgo, you’re in a calm place and won’t get ruffled. This little storm passes quickly and is gone by the weekend.

"
2976,14 september 2018,taurus,"If anyone tries to hold you back today, I wish them luck. No way, no how, are you going to put up with anybody’s nonsense. This is true both at home and at work. Just a little piece of advice though…be careful what you say to the boss. Your family is another story!

"
2977,15 september 2018,taurus,"You’re willing to take chances in many areas of your life, Taurus! But if you’re smart, you’ll do some serious research first. Fortunately for you, deep diving Pluto is in the mood for doing a good snoop. It doesn’t matter if you’re planning a world trip or world domination….the sky is the limit right now.

"
2978,16 september 2018,taurus,"Lucky, abundant Jupiter is smiling from your house of commitment, anxious to solidify your romance. And if you’re not currently involved with someone, you should be out there looking. This entire week is a nice one for amour, especially this coming Thursday.

"
2980,18 september 2018,taurus,"Anyone who gets in your way today will experience the full wrath of charged up bull! The two most aggressive planets, Mars and Uranus, are at loggerheads today. Things could get mighty combustible, so think before you lash out. This is especially true with authority figures.

"
2981,19 september 2018,taurus,"Is there someone whom you’ve been crushing on? Then take that chance and go after them today. Need to add more juice to an existing relationship? Then start planning some adventures. With the Sun in your house of romance and creativity, it’s time to pull out all the stops.

"
2982,20 september 2018,taurus,"The Sun will be leaving your house of fun and romance within 48 hours, but that’s no reason to get upset! A Sun-Mercury aspect today encourages you to plan your next set of adventures, things that will take place over the next few months. Sometimes we need to book these things in our calendar to make sure that they get done. Otherwise it’s work, work, work.

"
2983,21 september 2018,taurus,"It’s time to get real about your level of vitality, Taurus. If you’re overweight and out of shape, the cosmos has you in its crosshairs! The same goes if you’re not getting enough sleep or not treating your body like a temple. Mercury enters your health sector today and the Sun goes there tomorrow. You can run, but you can’t hide.

"
2984,22 september 2018,taurus,"Practicality rules for the next four weeks now that the Sun is in the most efficient part of your chart. People may try to sway you over to their way of thinking.

"
2985,23 september 2018,taurus,"This is no time for taking crazy risks. Nor is it a time to let other people let a plan go off the rails. This may mean that you’ll have to step up and take control of the situation. But with assertive Mars in your house of authority, this will be no problem.

"
2986,24 september 2018,taurus,"Are you feeling caged in? By your job, a lover, bad health or not having enough money? From your chart it appears that way.

"
2987,25 september 2018,taurus,"People could so bogged down in rules and details that absolutely nothing will get done! This includes you, by the way. Sometimes we need to step away from a situation in order to see the bigger picture. Take a break, consider what’s going on and climb to the top of that mental mountain for 360° view.

"
2988,26 september 2018,taurus,"“Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be.” So said Abraham Lincoln, and his sage advice applies to you today. If you choose to be miserable, you will be…but you can also choose to see the brighter side of life.

"
2991,29 september 2018,taurus,"Should you do things the same old way, or take a leap of faith and try something new? The best way to find out is to experiment. Shake things up a little today and see what works.

"
2992,30 september 2018,taurus,"You will be able to mix practicality and fantasy today. Your creative juices are flowing, but so is your logic.

"
2993,1 october 2018,taurus,"You may feel like doing something out of the ordinary, something that will get you noticed. But is now the right time to garner all of this attention? From your chart, it appears that your best work should be done behind the scenes. Keep a low profile for now.

"
2994,2 october 2018,taurus,"People will be talking in circles today, so don’t expect clarity. Seeing the big picture, or the end result, may also be difficult. Don’t let this bother you. The new Moon next Monday is the perfect time for seeing things for what they are.

"
2995,3 october 2018,taurus,"If you need to say something, today’s the day to get it out there. The passionate Moon is in the most expressive part of your chart, and Venus is in the diplomatic sector. You should be able to speak without yelling, and communicate with meaning.

"
2996,4 october 2018,taurus,"Your bullish side could rear up today, and if anyone waves a red flag you’ll be ready to charge. Slow down there, el toro. You run the risk of hurting people’s feelings, or worse….making an enemy out of someone who supports you.

"
2997,5 october 2018,taurus,"Are you in or are you out? Venus begins to retrograde in your partnership zone, making you question romantic AND business connections. Fortunately this will be over by Halloween, so you won’t be caught in limbo forever.

"
2998,6 october 2018,taurus,"Should you blend in with the crowd or do things your own way? That’s the question with a Moon-Neptune opposition. It may be tempting to fit in, but you could pay a price. There’s nothing wrong with being a rugged individualist.

"
2999,7 october 2018,taurus,"People may demand a lot from you today and into next week. Chances are that you’ll start feeling resentful about it too. While tomorrow’s new moon occurs in one of the most cooperative parts of your chart, you don’t have to do everyone else’s job.

"
3000,8 october 2018,taurus,"Today’s new Moon is the best time all year to get organized and back on track with tasks and yes, your diet! But you could be feeling especially bullheaded about it, refusing to dive in. Ask yourself this: do you really want to wake up six months from now and have the same pile of papers on your desk and a muffin top? No? Then get moving.

"
3001,9 october 2018,taurus,"You’re in a highly practical,”let’s get things done” kind of place. As a result, this is a good time to negotiate, work things out and make sure that other people are doing their share. Mercury is now in your house of serious relationships, easing the journey ahead.

"
3002,10 october 2018,taurus,"Feeling bullish? Watch out there, el toro–your forceful side could come out with a vengeance today. Diplomacy could go out the window as you try to push your agenda. This is not a good plan. Play nice.

"
3003,11 october 2018,taurus,"You’re surrounded by people who seem to have their heads stuck in the sand, unable to see what’s in front of them. This energy is going to continue for a few more days. But fortunately, the clouds break today—for a little while, anyhow. So if you need to get a point across or gain cooperation form others, get cracking.

"
3004,12 october 2018,taurus,"You know what they say: if you want to travel to distant lands, you have to leave the shore! And that’s the message that the cosmos has for you today. Don’t get so caught up in preparation or planning or the details. At some point ya just gotta act.

"
3005,13 october 2018,taurus,"Remember all that stuff that you mama said about jumping off bridges——if a friend of yours does it, are you going to follow and do something stupid? That’s the message that the cosmos has for you today. Avoid going along with the crowd, because they may not know what the hell they’re doing, or worse—they’re trying to throw you off course intentionally.

"
3006,14 october 2018,taurus,"Take a look at your life’s bucket list, if you have one. At the very least, do a mental review. Today’s Moon-Saturn aspect is a winner for making smart, calculated risks. It’s time to stop putting some of these things off. Put them in to play!

"
3007,15 october 2018,taurus,"People around you may need a gentle push to do what you want. Maybe it’s a kid who needs to clean their room, or a lover who needs to open up more. Maybe it’s a business associate who could use some direction. The good news is that you won’t need a hammer to drive a point home.

"
3008,16 october 2018,taurus,"Why not change the way you express yourself? Write a book. Switch up your social media strategy. Learn to speak another language. Shake things up a little bit!

"
3009,17 october 2018,taurus,"Your motivation should rise now that the Moon joins Mars in the most ambitious part of your chart. You’re better off working alone rather than teaming up with others, at least for the next few days. By Sunday people will be ready to cooperate with you.

"
3010,18 october 2018,taurus,"Doing things the same old way can be a bad idea sometimes, but at other moments it’s the right tactic. Pay attention to your methods: are you taking too many risks? Not playing by the rules? You might make a bad impression. Don’t forget, your success in life does  depend on other people supporting your plans.

"
3011,19 october 2018,taurus,"Over the next four weeks other people will play a large part in your world. If you need a shoulder to cry on, or someone else does, a superb Mercury aspect will allow this to happen. It’s a better day for listening than for making demands.

"
3015,23 october 2018,taurus,"Ready for commitment and being diplomatic? Or do you want to do your own thing? El Sol enters your house of serious relationships, but spunky Uranus is firing up your stubborn side. Being bullish could backfire. Try to see both sides of an issue.

"
3016,24 october 2018,taurus,"And that’s a wrap! The annual full moon in your sign occurs today. Try to put the finishing touches on activities that you started around the time of your birthday.

"
3020,28 october 2018,taurus,"It’s your turn to shine a little bit, Taurus. With so much recent planetary activity in houses that deal with other people, you may feel as though you’ve been left out. Come on, step right up to center stage. Take a bow and bask in the limelight!

"
3021,29 october 2018,taurus,"Changes are happening in the way you handle your relationships with other people. Generous Jupiter is encouraging you to be more open and patient. Try to give people the benefit of a doubt. If they don’t respond, at least you know you did all that you could.

"
3022,30 october 2018,taurus,"Transformative Pluto is in your house of taking risks and living a bolder life. But who should you bring with you on your journey? Consider the company you keep very carefully. Only allow people in who are willing to take the same chances that you are.

"
3023,31 october 2018,taurus,"If you’re carrying all the weight in a romance, family situation or the workplace, chances are you’re pissed. And today’s planetary energy will just add fuel to that fire! It’s time to let others know that you’re not the go-to person or the grunt.

"
3024,1 november 2018,taurus,"Your self-esteem gets a nice boost from a happy Jupiter aspect. You don’t necessarily need the approval of other people, but you can get it today. To your surprise, you may realize that you have impressed more people than you knew.

3025,2 november 2018,taurus,"Your values and dreams may clash with those of other people. While this may be confusing, it doesn’t have to be a deal breaker. Just remember that we all have our own individual paths to walk in this world. Don’t feel that you have to change your plans to fit in with other people.

"
3026,3 november 2018,taurus,"You seem to be driven by values that are a cut above what other people select. This doesn’t mean that you are better than they are; it’s just that you expect more from yourself and out of life. Don’t let anyone try to make you back down from what you believe.

"
3027,4 november 2018,taurus,"Live for the moment, Taurus. Yes, you need to get things done. But it appears that you’re racing through life without taking some much-needed downtime. Set aside quality time for yourself and your loved ones.

"
3029,6 november 2018,taurus,"It’s time to wrap up unfinished business, Taurus. It’s also time to get rid of emotional baggage that is holding you back.

"
3038,15 november 2018,taurus,"Feeling secure about who you are is mighty important, Taurus. No matter what is going on in the world around you, as long as you feel comfortable with your own values you’ll be OK. Be choosy about who you hang around with. Make sure that your friends share the same values as you.

"
3039,16 november 2018,taurus,"You need to slow down and make sure that major financial and romantic decisions are spot on. Mercury has just gone retrograde in a house that governs both. It’s one thing to be optimistic; it’s another to be foolish and ignoring danger signals.

"
3042,19 november 2018,taurus,"If something sounds too good to be true, it probably isn’t! Which is why you need to be careful of someone trying to sell you some happy-happy BS story. People could also be trying to get you to do things their way. The bottom line is that you don’t have to.

"
3043,21 november 2018,taurus,"If anyone thinks that you are a pushover, they’re in for a big surprise. You weren’t put on this planet to do everyone else’s grunt work. You could have an “aha!” moment today, the kind that makes you realize that you’re worth a lot more than you may have realized.

3046,24 november 2018,taurus,"Confusion about friends or team activities should start to dissipate now that Neptune has gone direct in your house of networking. But you still need to keep an eye open for hangers-on or trolls who just want to throw shade at everyone. Be selective.

"
3047,25 november 2018,taurus,"Some of your more audacious plans may need to be scaled back a bit. The good news is that you’re thinking big.

3050,28 november 2018,taurus,"Road trip! My two favorite words in the English language, and maybe they’re your favorites too. This is an excellent time to plan a group vacation with the tribe, the more adventurous the better. It’s time to go off the grid and have crazy stories that you’ll be telling your grandchildren.

"
3051,29 november 2018,taurus,"Got a secret admirer? It sure looks that way from your chart! Or maybe you’re crushing on someone. If you’re happily involved in love, then today’s cosmic energy is super for a romantic rendezvous behind closed doors. Ggrrrrrr.

"
3053,1 december 2018,taurus,"The planets are sending you mixed messages about romance! Today, Mercury goes retrograde in your house of commitment.

This should help ease things, and by the 12th your romance can start developing momentum.

"
3054,2 december 2018,taurus,"People could get pushy today, but that doesn’t mean you have to go along with their plans.

"
3056,4 december 2018,taurus,"These days it may feel difficult to communicate with loved ones. That’s because Mercury is retrograde in your house of commitment. But today brings some healing energy from the moon. Don’t worry; Mercury resumes direct motion on Thursday and things should straighten out shortly thereafter.

"
3057,5 december 2018,taurus,"The more people talk, the more confused you’re going to become! That’s because murky Neptune is acting up in your house of friends and networking.

3061,9 december 2018,taurus,"Joining forces with others is a smart way to go. Far too often, you stubbornly do things on your own.

3066,14 december 2018,taurus,"Just because someone is a friend, acquaintance or colleague doesn’t mean that they ned to know everything that’s going on in your life. Keep some things to yourself, especially since you’ll be meeting new folks.

"
3067,15 december 2018,taurus,"We’re known by the company we keep. A strong lunar aspect today encourages you to slow down and consider who your friends and acquaintances are. Also, think about groups you may be part of, such as a volunteer or charity team. Are these the right people for you? Do you want to make more friends if you’re feeling a bit alone? Now’s a good time for changes.
 
 

"
3068,16 december 2018,taurus,"There is a time to take risks and then there is a time to stay away from them. Fortunately for you, the universe is telling you to put yourself out there little bit more! Logical Saturn has your back. From love to money to travel to study, the world is your oyster. Have fun.

"
3069,17 december 2018,taurus,"There could be some kind of shakeup coming in a team or group, both professionally and personally. But for you this is a good thing. Perhaps you haven’t realized it, but some of these people may have been holding you back. Now the brakes are coming off and it’s your turn to shine.

"
3070,18 december 2018,taurus,"Sometimes emotional healing is a long and difficult process, with plenty of meetings on a therapist’s couch. But sometimes it can happen with lightning like speed. That’s what’s going to happen today, Taurus. A powerful Uranus aspect is just the ticket for recognizing what emotions need to go. Chuck them and move on.

"
3071,19 december 2018,taurus,"It’s up to you to feel good about yourself; others can’t do it for you. So drop the blame game and take responsibility for whatever is bothering you. Remember, you have the strength of a bull.

"
3072,20 december 2018,taurus,"Healing can happen for more quickly than you realize, bull. So if your tired body or soul needs “fixing”, ponder what you can do to get the process started. Be open to new modalities and ideas because the Sun will be soon entering the most forward-thinking part of your chart.

"
3073,21 december 2018,taurus,"El Sol changes signs today, gliding into your house of taking risks. In a nice coincidence, Jupiter and Mercury are winking at you from your house of sex! WHAA?? I guess you need to be more adventurous in the boudoir, babe! But you could also take some risks when it comes to starting a business, traveling to destinations that are off the grid or learning more in a class.

"
3074,22 december 2018,taurus,"Got places to go and people to meet? I’ll say! The full moon occurs in one of the most social parts of your chart. Keep an open mind, as the cosmos could send new connections your way that are out of the ordinary.

"
3075,23 december 2018,taurus,"There’s nothing wrong with having big ideas, and you seem to have plenty. People around you have noticed. Don’t be surprised if you receive some kind of offer or discover that people want to team up with you.

"
3076,24 december 2018,taurus,"People could be a tad emotional today, Taurus. This includes friends as well as family. You can try to get to the bottom of things, but it probably won’t work. Wait until Thursday, when the aspects for communication are much better.

"
3077,25 december 2018,taurus,"Merry Christmas, Taurus! The Moon is now in your fuzzy, warm domestic sector. It’s a wonderful day for relaxing with the people you love the most, and that includes friends. A party atmosphere is building throughout the rest of the week, so get ready to paint the town red.

"
3078,26 december 2018,taurus,"People tend to reminisce about the past at holiday time. But your sign maybe feeling mushier than the rest. Blame it on the Moon in Leo, which is transiting your house of relatives and childhood memories. To your surprise, old memories that you had forgotten may come rushing back. Brilliant Uranus is lighting up the house of the subconscious mind.

"
3079,27 december 2018,taurus,"If you’re not certain about what step to take next, reach out to a friend or mentor. They can provide you with valuable advice. Don’t take action right away though; wait until motivational Mars enters Aries on New Year’s Eve. Aries is your house of research and quiet reflection.

"
3080,28 december 2018,taurus,"You may feel like an untamed, bucking bronco over the next few days. Uh…is there anything wrong with that? Hell no, it’s your nature! So why are other people trying to subdue you? Maybe they’re afraid that you’re going places. You are.

"
3081,29 december 2018,taurus,"Make a vow to surround yourself only with the very best of people. With Mars moving through your house of friendship and networking, it’s critical that your inner circle reflects who you really are as a person. Remember this as you make new friends and contacts.

"
3082,30 december 2018,taurus,"Have you completely had it with a muffin top, or a beer belly? Fed up and tired with being sick and tired? The cosmos is handing you a ration of whoop ass today, Taurus. It’s reality time. If your health and fitness levels aren’t up to par, it’s up to you to change them.

"
3083,31 december 2018,taurus,"New Year’s Eve may be here, but you may not feel like a party animal. That’s because Mars enters the most secluded part of your chart. Even if you do decide to go out on the town tonight (and you’re entitled to!), over the next few weeks you may pull away from the crowd. It’s time to do some serious inner work.

"
3084,8 march 2018,gemini,"No matter how pulled together you are, no matter how efficient, there are new hacks and apps and techniques that you can use to make your life easier. And with Jupiter retrograding in your productivity sector, you’d be wise to start looking into some of these things. This is true both at home and the workplace. You’ll free up more spare time and feel less stressed—a total win-win.

"
3085,9 march 2018,gemini,"You could be in quite an assertive mood today, but watch that it doesn’t turn into aggression. You want you want and that’s OK, but if your needs involve others, they may resent a pushy attitude.

"
3086,10 march 2018,gemini,"You could be quite starry eyed today as Venus is casting her spell. Day dreaming about big future plans is always fun, but if you want to see any of them manifest, you have to get down to the nitty gritty. Are you ready to do that Gemini?

"
3087,11 march 2018,gemini,"Make sure that you’re surrounded by people who support you, Gemini. According to your chart there are those who might be opposed to your ideas or values. Can you agree to disagree, or is it time to make some new connections?

"
3088,12 march 2018,gemini,"Help or support might come from a surprising source, Gemini. But you can’t sit around and wait for it to show up on your doorstep. Think about who has the skills, connections, resources or wisdom to help you–and then reach out to them.

"
3089,13 march 2018,gemini,"Your career can gain momentum over the next few weeks. One of the best ways to pull this off is to impress muckety mucks with your level of organization, discipline and talent. Choose team members wisely though, as there could be some slackers and trolls who want to dim your light.

"
3090,14 march 2018,gemini,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Gemini, something that you would be wise to remember. In your rush to get things done you may overextend yourself. Set aside some time for enjoying the sweeter things in life.

"
3091,15 march 2018,gemini,"Creating long term wealth is possible, thanks to the Moon gliding into your house of success. But you need to consider the other people who might be involved, such as a spouse or business partner. It’s imperative that they share the same values and good habits as you.

"
3092,16 march 2018,gemini,"Ready to set off on a new career path? Then start getting inspired. A delicious Moon-Neptune aspect will help you develop a few good options. Once the new moon arrives on Saturday, you can take the necessary steps to follow your bliss.

"
3093,17 march 2018,gemini,"Feel like creating wealth? I’m talking Big Bucks, not chump change. If that’s the case the cosmos has your back! Two planetary aspects today can help you go from broke to rich: the new moon in your house of ambition and success, and Mars entering your net worth sector. You are in an awesome  spot for making changes. No lottery tickets here though; hard work does the trick.

"
3094,18 march 2018,gemini,"Soul sucking jobs are not your lot in life, Gemini, so don’t think that it’s your karma to have to put up with them. Once the Sun enters Aries on Tuesday you will be meeting many new people, some of whom will have excellent connections and ideas for you.

"
3095,19 march 2018,gemini,"If you’re looking for a new job, raise or to boost your company’s revenues, the planets have your back. Make that big ask. Shop your resume. Develop a marketing or social media campaign. Ya don’t ask, ya don’t get!

"
3096,20 march 2018,gemini,"Despite the fact that the Sun is now in the friendliest part of your chart, you need to be circumspect about the people you allow into your world. Likewise, you shouldn’t be spilling all of your personal details to them. Mercury goes retrograde in this sector on Thursday. Be confident, breezy and friendly, but above all, be cautious.

"
3097,21 march 2018,gemini,"Start reaching out to people who can help you with your goals, Gemini. It doesn’t matter if you’re trying to lose weight or snag a promotion—gaining wisdom or cooperation from others is the key to making things happen.

"
3098,22 march 2018,gemini,"Your life is your own, Gemini–don’t let anyone run it for you. Over the next few weeks you may need to pull away from friends or even business contacts. Mercury is now retrograde in your house of networking and friends. Be sociable, cooperate with others but be the master of your own fate.

"
3099,23 march 2018,gemini,"Sometimes the nicer you are the more you get taken advantage of! Sad but true, and that’s the kind of energy going on for your sign today. Don’t be a pushover; stand your ground.

"
3100,24 march 2018,gemini,"Aggressively pursuing your own agenda could backfire on you, so think before you hassle people. It’s important right now to at least appear  to be a team player. Suck it up and compromise, even if you think it’s going to kill you.

"
3101,25 march 2018,gemini,"It’s always a good thing when someone thinks that they can take on the world or new challenges; that’s the only way that things of importance are done! But don’t get too carried away with your ideas. They need to have a stable, practical base to stand on first.

"
3102,26 march 2018,gemini,"Watch what you post on social media or put in a text, as a tense Moon-Mercury square could find your words being forwarded to too many people. This is true within friendships, the office or even outside activities like a sports team or a club that you’re part of. Sshhhh!!

"
3103,27 march 2018,gemini,"It’s such a cliche that your sign has the gift for gab, but a superb Moon-North Node aspect today suggests that your words can take you very far indeed! Consider blogging, writing a book or screen play, hitting the lecture circuit or teaching. You may have a message that people need to hear.

"
3104,28 march 2018,gemini,"You could make some interesting new acquaintances over the next 48 hours, people who could shake up your life…in a good way! This is the best time in 2018 to make new friends or industry connections, find a lover or pick the mind of a mentor. Get out there and network.

"
3105,29 march 2018,gemini,"Whose rules are your playing by, Gemini–yours or someone else’s? Other people may be trying hard to get you to play by their game plan. But if their values don’t match yours, things could fall apart. Get clear on this before you go any further.

"
3106,30 march 2018,gemini,"Don’t settle for table scraps when it comes to your career, Gemini! The new moon on the 17th has opened the door for you to find more meaningful and higher paying work, but you need to walk through it. You’ll have to push past your existing comfort level but that’s what personal growth is all about.

"
3107,31 march 2018,gemini,"An emotional or romantic catharsis may take place, courtesy of a full moon in your house of love and feelings. You may find yourself in a thoughtful mood, reflecting about the state of your closest relationships. The wisdom that you’re seeking can be found within.

"
3108,1 april 2018,gemini,"The company you keep will be super important this week. Do you share the same values, goals or levels of talent? Today’s a good time to find out as chatty Mercury is well placed for holding meaningful talks.

"
3109,2 april 2018,gemini,"Slow down there, skippy! I-want-it-now Mars is burning through your house of sex, love and net worth. But if you’re too anxious to seal a deal you might make some serious mistakes. Remember, you have a logical side of your brain, the left half. Use it.

"
3110,3 april 2018,gemini,"Just how committed are you to being a team player, Gemini? Fortunately the planets are lining up in such a way as to help you find people with your passion for your work, sports, hobbies and life in general. Surround yourself with people who know how to give and receive.

"
3111,4 april 2018,gemini,"You don’t need anyone else’s permission to run your life the way you choose, Gemini. Your values and dreams may not mesh with those of the people around you, and that’s fine. How boring would life be if we all thought alike?

"
3112,5 april 2018,gemini,"Trying to keep up with the Kardashians (or anyone else you know who likes to spend too much) could backfire on you big time, Gemini. Keep your credit cards locked up and keep FOMO at bay. Let everyone else worry about the state of their finances.

"
3113,6 april 2018,gemini,"If you need to heal a rift with a lover, co-worker or friend, today’s a good time to do so. The emotional Moon is in the most diplomatic part of your chart, telling you to get over your ego (and anger, resentment, pride and whatever else is holding you back).

"
3114,7 april 2018,gemini,"You should be feeling stronger emotionally, more so than you have felt in a long time. Mature Saturn is helping you sort out your feelings. There’s less room in your life for drama, which makes space for more contentment.

"
3115,8 april 2018,gemini,"Opinions are not the same thing as facts, and fortunately you’ll be able to separate the two today. Whether it’s your own opinion or someone else’s, be logical and get to the bottom of the matter.

"
3116,9 april 2018,gemini,"It’s time to stop doing things the same old way and use your imagination! Besides, the more you’re willing to think creatively, the greater a chance you have of finding solutions to problems that have been vexing you for months.

"
3117,10 april 2018,gemini,"Watch your words today, Gemini. Yes I know, you love to chat, but if you make proclamations about things without truly having knowledge about them you may appear foolish. Let someone else make an ass of themselves.

"
3118,11 april 2018,gemini,"Ggrrr!! The cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, are winking at each other across the heavens today. Better yet, they’re in houses that govern sexuality, seclusion and intimacy. What can I say, other than to get a room?

"
3119,12 april 2018,gemini,"Mercury is still retrograde in your house of teamwork, and that means that not everyone is willing to cooperate or play fair. It’s up to you to decide whether you want to put up with it or not. Is it time to walk away from some commitments?

"
3120,13 april 2018,gemini,"It’s always easy to look at other people and identify what they’re doing wrong, but when it comes to analyzing ourselves….not so much! But a helpful Jupiter aspect will enable you to do just that today. Be honest, be brave and then make the necessary changes. Jupiter is all about abundance, its goal being to bring you better people and circumstances in life.

"
3121,14 april 2018,gemini,"There are several ways to get things done your way. One is to get in everyone’s face and make a big deal about it. Another method is to assert quiet power and dignity, allowing others to process your intention. The latter is the best MO to use over the next few days.

"
3122,15 april 2018,gemini,"Who’s on Team Gemini? Who would you like  to have on your team? There could be some big changes to your contact list over the next few months. Mercury has been retrograding through your house of friends and networking, possibly revealing who you can count on and who you can’t. It goes direct today, so it’s decision time.

"
3123,16 april 2018,gemini,"There’s an old saying about how we become like the five people we hang around with the most. Whether that’s a good thing or not is a question that only you can answer. Today’s new moon in your house of friends and networking is the perfect time to cut ties that are no longer right for you, and to meet new folks who are.

"
3124,17 april 2018,gemini,"Despite the recent new moon stirring up energy in the friendliest part of your chart, you’ll need to choose your connections carefully over the next few months. Saturn begins to retrograde in your house of love and money. Don’t fall for an irresponsible lover or a slick salesperson who wants to con you. Be choosy with the people you allow into your world.

"
3125,18 april 2018,gemini,"Team efforts get a shot of adrenaline thanks to a spunky Sun-Uranus conjunction! It’s also a wonderful time to make new connections, and this could happen in a most unusual way.

"
3126,19 april 2018,gemini,"The Dalai Lama has famously said that if you think that everything is someone else’s fault, you will suffer a lot. But when you realize that everything springs from yourself, you’ll learn joy and peace. And that’s the message that the cosmos has for you today, Gemini.

"
3127,20 april 2018,gemini,"An intense period of introspection begins as the Sun quietly glides into Taurus, your twelfth house of the subconscious mind. The kinds of thoughts you think, the emotions you experience, your habits, sorrows and joys: all of these are up for review. The next four weeks will be the most intense but this energy carries out for several months.

"
3128,21 april 2018,gemini,"Your emotions could be going all over the place, due to aggressive Mars stirring up the pot in your house of deep feelings. Logic will be in short supply today, so do yourself a favor and keep your mouth shut….and those fingers off the keypads. Otherwise you might say something that you’ll end up regretting.

"
3129,22 april 2018,gemini,"Pluto governs power, and the kind that exists between lovers is always an interesting situation. People kill for love, they die for love. I’ve even heard that they’ll obsessively snoop their lover’s text messages and e-mails! Pluto has just retrograded in your house of intimacy and sexuality. It’s time to get real about how you handle your  emotions when it comes to amour.

"
3130,23 april 2018,gemini,"Thinking long term about the future is the way to go these days, Gemini. If all you’re worried about is short term gratification you’ll miss out on opportunities to secure your future, both romantically and financially.

"
3131,24 april 2018,gemini,"Sweet! Glam girl Venus enters Gemini, making you the sexiest thang in town. Over the next three weeks you’ll turn a lot of heads, that’s for sure! Makeover magic could also be calling your name, enticing you to reinvent yourself. Have fun!

"
3132,25 april 2018,gemini,"Just how fast do you want a romantic relationship to go, Gemini? Or new friendships? You need to slow down and get to know other people better before you form a deeper bond. It’s not that they’re trying to deceive you; it’s a matter of developing trust.

"
3133,26 april 2018,gemini,"Yowza! Lusty Mars and, uh, penetrating Pluto meet up in your house of sexuality and intimacy today. This is truly one of the steamiest days of 2018 for your sign. But beware of thinking with your private parts instead of your brain. In addition, jealousy and other stinky emotions could reach epic proportions.

"
3134,27 april 2018,gemini,"Lovers and friends might be working your nerves due to a Moon-Mercury opposition. You’re coming from a place of desiring teamwork and openness, but others may not be feeling the same way. You can choose to get pissed off or ignore it. The full moon on Monday will bring everything to a rolling boil, so wait until then to make decisions.

"
3135,28 april 2018,gemini,"Your emotions could easily get the best of you today due to a Moon-Mars square. Either you’ll be dreaming up worst case scenarios or others will find it all too easy to push your buttons. Fortunately the full moon on Monday is in the most practical part of your chart, so you’ll gain clarity pretty quickly.

"
3136,29 april 2018,gemini,"You’re craving stability in your life and today’s Sun-Saturn aspect is well aspected to make it happen. Both your financial picture and your love life are poised for improvement, but it won’t happen by magic. You need to improve your financial habits and the way in which you cooperate with a lover if you ant to see changes take place.

"
3137,30 april 2018,gemini,"The full moon in Scorpio is all about getting caught up on chores and unfinished projects. While you’re at it, get rid of time-wasting habits and ineffective systems. There is some seriously positive energy coming from planets in your net worth and career sectors, but if you want to see the big bucks, you need to get organized first.

"
3138,1 may 2018,gemini,"Yesterday’s full moon fell in your ultra-organized sixth house, demanding that you get your act together, both at home and at the office. Problem is, Uranus is in a tough spot from your house of teamwork, indicating that you may be surrounded by slackers, egomaniacs and other slugs who don’t want to pull their own weight. Don’t get stuck carrying their load.

"
3139,2 may 2018,gemini,"Lovely Venus is in your sign, putting your desires front and center. And what’s wrong with that?  It can’t be about other people all the time. Unfortunately there are those who do  think that it should be all about them. It may be time to set some boundaries.

"
3140,3 may 2018,gemini,"If there’s one message that the cosmos is trying to send you right now, it’s to get your house in order. This literally means your abode, but also your body, mind and soul. There’s no room for sloppy habits, low energy or scattered thinking. Pull it together.

"
3141,4 may 2018,gemini,"Snap out of it! There’s no room in your life for raging emotions taking you all over the place. Fortunately mature, wise Saturn is on the job, helping you to become more balanced and logical.

"
3142,5 may 2018,gemini,"Read the fine print if you’re making any major financial decisions right now, whether it’s an investment or a job offer. It’s not that people are trying to deceive you. But you have to make sure that deals are fair, and that you don’t end up in a position in which someone has you under their thumb.

"
3143,6 may 2018,gemini,"Some people are arrogant, needing to assert their authority and push people around. But you know better than that. A stellar Neptune-Sun aspect allows you to be quietly authoritative. Sometimes keeping a low profile is the best way to get attention.

"
3144,7 may 2018,gemini,"People who are relying on you could be demanding, and you may end up feeling that nothing you do can please them. If your actions have been impeccable, then let it go. But if they’re even partially right you may need to clean up your act.

"
3145,8 may 2018,gemini,"You’re running the risk of burning out, Gemini. From your chart it appears that you’ve been pushing yourself too hard. There are only 24 hours in a day and you seem to be trying to fit in 30 hours of activities! Office related stress could also be draining your energy levels. Give yourself a much needed break.

"
3146,9 may 2018,gemini,"Money doesn’t grow on trees but you could certainly find greater sources of it if you’re willing to try. The Moon’s position in your ambition sector could spark some clever ideas. Friday is another fabulous time for inspiration to strike.

"
3147,10 may 2018,gemini,"Your imagination soars as vibey Neptune jazzes up your brain with inspirational thoughts, especially where your goals are concerned. You’re about to enter one of the brainiest periods of your life in which your mind can become the path to riches and great contentment.

"
3148,11 may 2018,gemini,"This is no time to hold back, Gemini. Yeah, I know, your sign is famous for being oh-so-verbal. But in reality you keep things inside. A helpful Sun-Pluto trine enables you to get the words out on topics that you may have kept under wraps for a long time.

"
3149,12 may 2018,gemini,"Trying to relate to others could feel like walking into a wall, Gemini. No matter what you say or do, your meaning will be misconstrued. The problem is that aggressive Mars could push your buttons and annoyance (or even anger) will be the result. Take a deep breath and wait for another day with better aspects.

"
3150,13 may 2018,gemini,"Now that logical Mercury is in the house of your psyche, it’s time to get real about issues that have been plaguing you. You can certainly seek wisdom and help from outside sources, but don’t forget that your own inner wisdom is there to guide you as well.

"
3151,14 may 2018,gemini,"Over the next few days a surprise event could occur with a friend, business contact or even with someone you haven’t met yet! So be open to meeting new people, but be selective too. When Uranus enters your house of seclusion tomorrow, you’ll be quite choosy about the company you keep. You may find that your own company is the best!

"
3152,15 may 2018,gemini,"You are now entering one of the most intense psychological periods of your entire life, Gemini! Brilliant Uranus is in the house of your subconscious mind and seclusion. Over the next eight years you will be healing emotional wounds from the past and cutting toxic ties. Many of you will become interested in developing your intuition and studying Eastern philosophy. The journey will have twists and turns but it will be worth it.

"
3153,17 may 2018,gemini,"A conflicting push-pull vibe is in place as Mars squares off against Uranus. Part of you is raring to go (maybe even where angels fear to tread) while another part of you (your intuitive mind) is holding back. When Venus changes signs on Saturday you’ll be in a better place to figure out your next move.

"
3154,18 may 2018,gemini,"Getting a grip on your emotions, fears and issues becomes a heck of a lot easier thanks to a healing Mercury-Saturn trine. Rational thinking wins the day, so cut out foo-foo thinking. If you need professional help, seek it. Otherwise be your own best friend and figure out what needs to be changed.

"
3155,19 may 2018,gemini,"Here’s a nice little early birthday present for you: profitable Venus enters your money sector today! If one of your wishes for the year ahead is to see more green, take action now and over the next three weeks. Next week is loaded with fabulous aspects for job hunting, showing off your skills, negotiating and entrepreneurship.

"
3156,20 may 2018,gemini,"Yes!! The Sun is now in your sign, Gemini. Happy birthday! What’s going to make this birthday year different from those in the past is that you’ll be searching for more security in love and your career. Posh Venus just entered your house of spending, recommending that you treat yourself to some birthday treats over the next three weeks.

"
3157,21 may 2018,gemini,"Speaking from the heart becomes a lot easier thanks to a Moon-Saturn aspect. The Moon is emotional and passionate, while Saturn is logical and calm. It’s the perfect combination for venting without coming off like a whiner, diva or crazy person!

"
3158,22 may 2018,gemini,"“Do things the same way you’ve always done them, and you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.” If that old saying makes you feel uncomfortable, then now’s the time to shake up your routine and attitude. Fortunately inspirational Neptune is in an awesome place for making this happen.

"
3159,23 may 2018,gemini,"You’re running the risk of underestimating how much time and effort a project will take, Gemini. You may also be unclear as to how dedicated other people may be to a particular cause or situation. Before you proceed, do a lot of thinking and get to the bottom of these issues.

"
3160,24 may 2018,gemini,"This is truly one of the best days in 2018 to make a wish upon a star. The Sun trines go-getter Mars, making you feel as though the sky is the limit. And why not? The only thing holding you back are your own fears—and they seem to be falling by the wayside.

"
3161,25 may 2018,gemini,"Feel like you’re in a career rut? Then today is superb for coming up with fresh ideas as to how to bust out of it. An unusual Jupiter-Neptune trine zaps you with creative ideas that could turn things around. 

"
3162,26 may 2018,gemini,"The iron fist in the velvet glove? That image is what the cosmos suggests for you today, Gemini. You don’t need to beat people over the head to get your point across. With subterranean Pluto increasing your self esteem in one of the most secluded parts of your chart, you can assert a subtle authority.

"
3163,27 may 2018,gemini,"Put your wallet and credit cards away. Don’t even think about window shopping. The same goes for trawling for swag on the net. A stern Venus-Saturn opposition could push you to spend for emotional reasons, when you really need to save.

"
3164,28 may 2018,gemini,"Blowing off your fitness routine and diet may look mighty fine today, thanks to the Moon being in a pissy mood! You may also not feel like cleaning the house or doing much at the office. If you can get away with it, just slack. Once Mercury goes into your sign tomorrow you can get back on track.

"
3165,29 may 2018,gemini,"Your birthday season gets another boost as sharp little Mercury moves into Gemini. This will put you into a practical mindset over the next three weeks, ready to tackle new challenges. But the full moon in your house of diplomacy and partnering recommends teaming up with people who will be fun to have along for the ride, people who will support your ideas.

"
3166,30 may 2018,gemini,"The recent full moon in your partnership zone asks you to set your own agenda aside, at least for a bit. You do  need other people to help you along your journey in life, whether you want to believe that or not. Fortunately verbal Mercury is now in your sign, making it easier to be diplomatic with others.

3168,1 june 2018,gemini,"The sky’s the limit! That’s the message the cosmos is sending your way. With megawatt Mars in fabulous spot in your house of thinking big, you can pull off just about anything. Just don’t blab too much about your plans, as chatty Mercury is in way too talkative a mood.

"

"
3171,4 june 2018,gemini,"This is your  time of year, Gemini, something that you’ll be reminded of today! A winning Sun-Mercury aspect in your sign boosts your confidence and helps you gain clarity. There may be times later in the week when you feel unsure, but they pass quickly.

"
3172,5 june 2018,gemini,"Head trips and ego battles could erupt with a Venus-Pluto opposition. Don’t stoop to this. If you’re at the receiving end of someone’s else’s passive-aggressive behavior (or outright pompous fit), the let them know that they can take their drama elsewhere.

"
3173,6 june 2018,gemini,"All of the thinking and planning in the world doesn’t mean a thing unless you’re wiling to take action, Gemini. Doubts may arise due to a Mercury-Neptune square. Do you have the chops to pull things off? Well, you won’t find that out from just sitting on your butt, will you?

"
3174,7 june 2018,gemini,"Your big plans for the future may have a hazy feel about them as you try to figure out what to do next. Blame it all on foggy Neptune, which is stirring up the mist in your house of goals and success. The upside is that the Sun in your sign is working hard to burn off the fog, so clarity will return soon.

"
3175,8 june 2018,gemini,"The past few days may have made you feel insecure or unimportant, and fortunately that planetary energy has passed like a fast moving storm. Now the Moon is in your house of partying and meeting new people, just in time for the weekend. So get out there and shake your tail feathers!

"
3176,9 june 2018,gemini,"With the Sun in your sign you’re bound to attract attention. Problem is, some people may feel as though you have too  much going for you….which could stir up envious glances and remarks. Too bad, they’d better get used to it! Once the new moon in Gemini shows up next week, you’ll have even more mojo.

"
3177,10 june 2018,gemini,"Your intuition is spot on with the Moon in the most psychic part of your chart! Use it to your advantage, as there could be people around who are trying to persuade you to do things their way. Coming up with genius ideas is also possible, so let your mind take you to a creative place.

"
3178,11 june 2018,gemini,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Gemini, something that you seem to be forgetting. Optimistic Jupiter is in your efficiency sector, making you feel as though you can take on the world. Not only is this not possible, but you’ll only end up feeling burned out and resentful.

As a result you may decide to pull away from the social scene as you ponder your alternatives. Spend the next few days in thought.

"
3182,15 june 2018,gemini,"If at all possible, don’t enter into binding financial situations today. Mercury, usually so shrewd a negotiator, is up against long-term Saturn. They are both in financial houses, which means that deals that you enter into could be shaky. This includes jobs, mortgages, stocks or even creating a joint account with a lover. Next Tuesday is a much better time for making your move.

"
3183,16 june 2018,gemini,"Creating more structure in your life is the message the cosmos has for you over the next week, Gemini. This has more to do with your daily routines and habits than it does your personal relationships. Your career especially is about to go through a transformative period, so be ready to take advantage of new options that come your way.

"
3184,17 june 2018,gemini,"We all need to communicate in some way when it comes to our career. Some of us need to improve our negotiating skills while others should be focusing on their writing style. Whatever area needs to get stronger, work on it today and over the next few weeks.

"
3185,18 june 2018,gemini,"Career matters might slow down now that Neptune is retrograde in your ambition sector. Expect job offers or business deals to get bogged down as people are confused or slow to respond. That said, you could uncover new ways to make money or even decide to change fields.

"
3186,19 june 2018,gemini,"Who says that Geminis are flaky social butterflies? You’ve got practicality oozing out of every pore with this week’s super-efficient aspects.

This could be anything from your love life to career to travel plans. From your chart it looks like the issues at hand are big ones, the kind that demand that you take a risk. When Mercury enters the brainiest part of your chart on the 29th, you’ll be able to figure out your next move.

"
3189,22 june 2018,gemini,"Support may come from a source you didn’t even know existed! Someone may try to help you behind the scenes—to find you a new job, hook you up with a potential mate or just to be a good friend when you need it most.

"
3190,23 june 2018,gemini,"This is not a good time to ask people in positions of power for favors….or money, for that matter! Wait until next week when the full moon arrives on Thursday. It’s a much better time for conversations and negotiating. Mercury enters your chatty third house, enabling you to charm the birds from the trees.

"
3191,24 june 2018,gemini,"There’s no point in being jealous over someone else’s success. With a helpful Moon-Pluto aspect you can create your own “luck” by applying yourself to your own endeavors. As long as you don’t expect overnight results, you can make a lot of headway.

"
3192,25 june 2018,gemini,"Feeling wishy-washy, as though it’s hard to make a decision about something? Not surprising with today’s Venus-Jupiter square. If you can, avoid making decisions until Friday when logical Mercury enters your house of brainstorming.

"
3193,26 june 2018,gemini,"Bigger isn’t always better, Gemini! Megawatt mars has been blazing a path through one of the most optimistic parts of your chart, super-sizing your plans. But the red planet is now retrograde, advising you to slow down and take a second look at what you’re doing.

But first you need to have a good handle on your cash flow and investments.

"
3195,28 june 2018,gemini,"The full moon in the sexiest part of your chart could encourage you to toss caution to the wind. This could be a good thing–you enter into a passionate, steamy chapter with your soulful lover; or a bad thing–you hook up with the wrong person and end up with your emotions in a twist. Think before jumping into the sack or committing your heart.

"
3196,29 june 2018,gemini,"There’s no holding you back, Gemini. Verbal Mercury is now in your house of communicating, so you’ll be more than ready to say what’s on your mind.

No problem–figure out where you’ve been going wrong and make adjustments. Life is for learning; no one goes through it without making some errors in judgment.

"
3198,1 july 2018,gemini,"People may be annoying the daylights out of you with their indecisive behavior. They may not be doing it deliberately, but still–you want to know what’s going on! Pushing for an answer will backfire, so either back away or try a more indirect approach.

"
3199,2 july 2018,gemini,"Looking for love? Then get the word out. Show your pretty or handsome face in public! A sweet Mercury-Saturn aspect urges all Geminis to socialize, and that includes those of you who are attached. Spend some fun quality time with your lover.

"
3201,4 july 2018,gemini,"Don’t be too quick to give away your personal power, Gemini. You don’t have to beat people over the head like a tyrant, but it’s not smart to be too passive either. Think of the iron hand in the velvet glove metaphor, and you’ll nail it.

"
3205,8 july 2018,gemini,"Are you ready for more responsibility at the job, or even changing fields? A potent Sun-Neptune connection is putting you in the mood for chasing after grander goals. Neptune is the planet of inspiration, so don’t be surprised if your ideas are changing radically.

Fortunately, gentle Venus glides into your domestic sector today. You’ll be able to put people on notice that you’re expecting a lot more cooperation, without beating them over the head with a broom.

"
3207,10 july 2018,gemini,"Keep your cards close to your vest, Gemini–and your wallet as well.

Before making any important decisions about taking a new job, making an investment or signing legal documents with financial ramifications, slow down. Ask questions. Snoop around behind the scenes if need be.

"
3217,20 july 2018,gemini,"You don’t ask, you don’t get! That should be your mantra today. Don’t assume that other people have a clue as to what is going on in your mind. Even if they do, you need to speak up and claim what is yours.

"
3218,21 july 2018,gemini,"Your sign is famous for being out on the town having fun, but this weekend the energy is all about staying at home. The two most beneficial planets in the solar system, Venus and Jupiter, are both in a good mood from your domestic sector.

"
3219,22 july 2018,gemini,"You should be as happy as a pig in mud! Today the Sun enters Leo, your chatty third house of socializing and communicating. Just don’t say too much or go too wild in the partying department. Mercury is scheduled to retrograde in the same house this coming Thursday.

"
3223,26 july 2018,gemini,"Think before you speak! Mercury is now retrograde in your house of communication and short distance travel . You know the drill: don’t lock your keys in the car, make sure you don’t send emails to the wrong person and don’t leave sensitive documents in the copier at work. But this is also a good time for going back and re-examining projects that mean a lot to you. It’s all about strategy.

"
3224,27 july 2018,gemini,"Ready to bust out of an old groove? Even if you aren’t, the cosmos is getting ready to kick your rear end into action! A high octane lunar eclipse occurs in your house and taking risks. Over the next six months you can cover more ground than you have in the past few years. The best part will be looking at the surprised faces of all the people you know, who are shocked at what you’ve achieved!

"
3225,28 july 2018,gemini,"This is an excellent time to open up and speak your mind, especially with people who have been difficult to approach.

"
3227,30 july 2018,gemini,"It’s time to find some balance in your life, Gemini. Abundance of Jupiter is pushing you to take care of old chores and improve your habits, but you run the risk of burning out. There are only 24 hours in a day and your energy supplies are limited.

3229,1 august 2018,gemini,"You may be pushing hard to make progress, but it may feel like unseen forces are preventing you from making headway. Once Uranus goes retrograde next Tuesday, you’ll be able to suss out exactly what is mucking up the works. Until then, slow down and relax.

"

"
3231,3 august 2018,gemini,"You need to read between the lines of what other people are saying. Just because you are being straightforward doesn’t mean that they are. It’s not so much that they are lying. Rather, they maybe overestimating their abilities.

"
3232,4 august 2018,gemini,"You may experience an “aha!” moment today, thanks to the Moon meeting up with brilliant Uranus. Chances are, you won’t be coming up with some kind of newfangled invention or the cure for world peace. But you can dig deep into your psyche and find peace in your own mind.

"
3233,5 august 2018,gemini,"From your chart it appears that you need to adjust the way you speak to others, Gemini. It’s not that you’re being rude. But people in your world may be on head trips or can’t see the forest for the trees. You are going to need to cut through the smoke and mirrors and make things clear.

"
3234,6 august 2018,gemini,"The next four weeks are looking luscious for love as Venus is in your house of romance! But a harsh solar aspect indicates that people may be critical or majoring in the minors–and this includes you. Don’t let negative thinking prevent you from meeting someone new, or interfering with a current relationship.

"
3235,7 august 2018,gemini,"Uranus is the planet that helps you break free from confining situations, and today it goes retrograde. It will be spinning backwards in the house of the subconscious mind.

"
3236,8 august 2018,gemini,"This is a lucky day for romance, as Mars and Venus form a harmonious trine in the heavens. There is a highly social vibe going on too, so plan a luscious date night if you are already attached. If you’re not, the best place to meet someone is by being out and about. A friend could make a sweet introduction.

"
3237,9 august 2018,gemini,"Balance needs to be maintained in your closest relationships, Gemini. There has to be a good mix of independence, yet a feeling of comfort and commitment too.

3239,11 august 2018,gemini,"Your sign is famous for being social butterflies, so you’re going to love today’s solar eclipse. It occurs in your house chatting, partying, networking and buzzing about the neighborhood. But it could also open up a thoughtful period in which you do a lot of deep thinking, strategize with others and take classes. It’s all about self expression, so write that book, start that blog or work on your art portfolio.

"
3240,12 august 2018,gemini,"You might be tempted to really let your emotions and your mouth rip. Yesterday there was a solar eclipse in your house of communicating. And today, red hot Mars retrogrades back into your house of intimacy and psychological depth. You could choose to blast everyone who is pissing you off, or you could choose to do some deep reflection. I suggest the latter.

"
3241,13 august 2018,gemini,"If something feels off, it probably is. Pay attention to what your gut is telling you. People may be way too to anxious to get their own way, and they could use flattery to try to lure you in. Maintain a safe distance and do your own thing.

"
3242,14 august 2018,gemini,"It’s time to pamper yourself, Gemini! With the Moon forming a perfect angle with luxe Venus, you really should indulge in activities that make you feel good. Don’t wait for someone else to treat you like a king or a queen.

"
3243,15 august 2018,gemini,"People might rub you the wrong way today, Gemini. A Moon-Pluto square could drum up drama and power trips. The problem is, you might overreact. Instead of doing that, ask yourself if these people belong in your life. The recent solar eclipse was all about making new connections.

"
3255,28 august 2018,gemini,"Don’t think that you can get away with glossing over details, or BS-ing your way through something. You will  get caught, or mistakes will be made. Play by the rules and go over everything with a magnifying glass.

"

3354,8 december 2018,gemini,"Power plays could erupt in close relationships. Make sure that you’re not the instigator! But if anyone is trying to boss you around, let them politely know that you’re not going to stand for it. You don’t need anyone stage managing your life.

"
3355,9 december 2018,gemini,"You’ve been in a real go-getter mood lately, and chances are you’re feeling a little burned out. You show no signs of slowing down, so if you’re smart, you’ll start taking better care of your body. Don’t push it!

"
3356,10 december 2018,gemini,"Your confidence will grow over the next few days. Isn’t it wonderful when you can truly believe in yourself? People in places of power will notice also. It’s your hard work for ethic  and attention to detail that will dazzle them.

"
3357,11 december 2018,gemini,"People are looking up to you, whether you want to be a role model or not! This may come as a surprise to you, but hey–people are impressed by what they see in you. Chances are you may need to take on a leadership role.

"
3358,12 december 2018,gemini,"If you feel as though others are always pulling the strings, it’s time for a change. Shrewd Mercury enters your sign of diplomacy today, so you’ll be able to gain more control without screaming at people.

"
3359,13 december 2018,gemini,"Avoid getting in anyone’s face today, courtesy of a tense Mercury-Moon square. People will be in a confrontational mood and they could be critical. You don’t need to get caught up in their nonsense.

"
3360,14 december 2018,gemini,"Go your own way? Cooperating with others, or partnering with them, may not seem so attractive today. Mighty Mars is making you hella motivated, and other people could slow you down. This isn’t a permanent situation, it’s a temporary one. So do your own thing and let others catch up….if they can!

"
3361,15 december 2018,gemini,"So often in life we get stuck in a routine. We get up, go to work, come home and do it all over again. As a result out passion for life wanes. Well, get ready for a swift kick in the ass from the Moon, which is in a fabulous mood in your house of goals! It’s time to start feeling juiced up about life again.

"
3362,16 december 2018,gemini,"People need to know that you expect cooperation, Gemini. But screaming and yelling won’t be necessary. As a matter of fact, the calmer and more logical you are the more likely you will be to receive help. But if you don’t ask, it certainly won’t happen!

"
3363,17 december 2018,gemini,"Your desire to make bank is going through the roof, thanks to a meeting of the two most aggressive planets, Mars and Pluto. Start considering your options now for making and investing more money. Once the Sun enters Capricorn on Friday, doors will start to open.

"
3364,18 december 2018,gemini,"Serendipity is in the air. Something unexpected but fun could occur, so be ready. A friend, lover or business associate could introduce you to someone new, for instance. Or you could receive a text about an impromptu get-together. The good news is that people want to spend time with you, so enjoy it.

"
3365,19 december 2018,gemini,"You may have to suck it up today and play nice with people who don’t deserve it! Just roll with it. Tomorrow’s aspects are perfect for hanging out with friends or a lover, so smile right now and act like you care.

"
3366,20 december 2018,gemini,"A friend, lover or colleague could come up with an impromptu idea or invitation today and if you’re wise you will take them up on it. You may be known as the thinker of the zodiac but face it–other people are capable of coming up with concepts that you haven’t even considered!

"
3367,21 december 2018,gemini,"The Sun enters Capricorn, your eighth house of intimacy and net worth. Over the next four weeks you can make headway in both your love life and your finances. Partnering with others is incredibly well favored, so get ready to hear from people who want to either (a) love you madly and/or (b) form a business relationship with you.

"
3368,22 december 2018,gemini,"From your chart it looks like you’re ready to build some serious wealth. The full moon takes place in your house of income and savings, and if you’re smart you’ll take a long range view. You’re an excellent position to pull in some serious coin but you also have to invest it wisely.

"
3369,23 december 2018,gemini,"No one should be telling you what to do—so why are you allowing it? Enough already. Let others know that they need to mind their own business. Besides, you are the best source of wisdom for yourself.

"
3370,24 december 2018,gemini,"It’s Christmas Eve, a time when people should be cooperating and cheerful. But  a cranky Mercury-Neptune aspect indicates that people may be pushy or just the opposite….slacking off. Which means that you may get stuck doing all the grunt work. But hey, keep the peace.

"
3371,25 december 2018,gemini,"A pleasant Neptune-Moon aspect helps you chill out and relax on this Christmas Day. Neptune is in an inspirational mood, so don’t be surprised if you start daydreaming about the things you’d like to manifest in 2019. The next five days are actually a smart time to start taking action.

"
3372,27 december 2018,gemini,"With aggressive Mars in your house of ambition, you should  be feeling confident and in control. But that may have not been the case lately. Fortunately, a helpful lunar aspect helps increase your self-esteem. You’ve got this.

"
3373,28 december 2018,gemini,"Teamwork counts for a lot over the next few days, so don’t try to ram your ideas down everyone’s throats. That said, you don’t need to give up your principles. It’s a delicate balance but you can pull it off.

"
3374,29 december 2018,gemini,"Mars is spending a few precious more days in your career sector, so make the most of it. Is a major career switch in order? Or maybe you just need to aim for a higher position where you currently are. A side hustle could be calling your name. Try to figure things out before New Year’s Eve, at which time Mars moves on.

"
3375,30 december 2018,gemini,"Someone could say or do something that catches you off guard. You can choose to get annoyed and upset about it, or, you can opt to remain calm. Don’t worry, you’ll have the opportunity to settle the score later on.

"
3376,31 december 2018,gemini,"Your sign is famous for being a social butterfly, but now you’re ready to become even more well connected! That’s because red hot Mars enters your house for friends and networking today. What a great way to start off the new year! In January and February you could make some important contacts, people who will be in your life for years to come.

"
3377,17 january 2018,cancer,"This is not a good day to cut corners or slack off. You may feel like taking a nap, calling in sick to work or basically goofing off. Going to the gym? You probably won’t feel like doing that either. But stick to it. Get everything done.

"
3378,19 january 2018,cancer,"Someone might dig in their heels today, most likely at the workplace. Clients and co-workers seem to be stuck in tunnel vision, unable to see more than five feet ahead of themselves. You, on the other hand, have dynamic Mars in the blue-skies-ahead, big picture sector. As a result, don’t expect others to appreciate the brilliance of your ideas. They won’t, and this continues into next week. But that’s OK. When Mars enters Aries on the 28th, you’ll become unstoppable.

"
3379,8 march 2018,cancer,"Your attitude about love will be changing dramatically over the next four months, courtesy of Jupiter going retrograde today in your house of romance. Jupiter is all about abundance, healing and enjoying life—so stop selling yourself short in matters of the heart! You deserve the best, and it’s up to you to set high standards—and stick to them.

"
3380,9 march 2018,cancer,"You’ll be highly motivated to get things done as the Moon meets up with go-getter Mars. This includes feeling healthier and becoming fit, so today’s the perfect time to research a fitness plan and diet.

"
3381,10 march 2018,cancer,"Give ‘em an inch and they’ll take a mile! That saying rings true today, Cancer, so think twice before you cut someone too much slack. This energy runs into next week. Don’t let anyone take advantage of your generous nature.

"
3382,11 march 2018,cancer,"The sudden urge to get caught up on things could strike, thanks to aggressive Mars being active in your efficiency sector. Take this energy and run with it, as you can get a lot done in a lot less time.

"
3383,12 march 2018,cancer,"A job offer or new client could come onto the scene pretty quickly, so make sure that you’ve got your resume ready or that you’re caught up on other tasks. It’s also possible that you generate a winner of an idea for making more money, and if inspiration strikes, run with it.

"
3384,13 march 2018,cancer,"You know what you want and you know how to get it, but don’t think that you have to go this alone. Consider who you’d like to take with you on your journey. Yes, your creativity and drive are strong, but other people can contribute with their own unique viewpoint and wisdom.

"
3385,14 march 2018,cancer,"Jealousy or resentment could rear their ugly little heads today. Whether it’s coming from you or someone else, these emotions won’t help, they’ll only hurt. So let them go, as Saturday’s new moon has some interesting things in store for you!

"
3386,15 march 2018,cancer,"Stern, mature Saturn may be cruising through your partnership sector over the next few years, but that doesn’t mean that you have to settle for a boring love life! Actually things could get really juicy when lusty, lively Mars enters your commitment sector on Saturday. Ready for la vida loca?

"
3387,17 march 2018,cancer,"Oohhh, Cancer, it looks like your love life is about to do a 180! Boring lovers spewing out the same old tripe, putting up with the same old crap in romance….kick it to the curb. Today’s new moon occurs in the most optimistic, exciting part of your chart. And then Mars zips into your house of commitment too. It’s time to put some romantic mojo into your love life.

"
3388,18 march 2018,cancer,"Material success isn’t everything, Cancer. Keep that in mind over the next few weeks as your ambition will rise. What’s the point of winning if you don’t have enough fun along the way?

"
3389,19 march 2018,cancer,"With the Sun entering the most ambitious part of your chart tomorrow, you should be thinking about what you’d like to achieve in the months ahead. And you won’t be thinking small, either: a vivacious Venus-Mercury meeting today tells you to go big and bold.

"
3390,20 march 2018,cancer,"Now that the Sun is in the most dynamic part of your chart you should feel your motivation rising. Just take your time and think things through before you make any key decisions. Besides, a spectacular aspect on the 28th could send some new ideas your way, things that you have never considered.

"
3391,21 march 2018,cancer,"Is there anyone from your past who can help you with your career? Think about colleagues, bosses or clients whom you may have worked with. Then reach out to them between now and April 15th. The next few weeks are auspicious for examining your career path and how you can switch things up.

"
3392,22 march 2018,cancer,"Don’t count your chickens before they hatch, Cancer. Mercury is now retrograde in your career sector, indicating that job offers, new clients or promising revenue streams could get held up. This energy runs through April 15th, so be patient.

"
3393,23 march 2018,cancer,"Who’s wearing the pants in your closest relationships? You’re in an excellent position to be in a place of calm, rational control–which includes sharing. But are others willing to play along?

"
3394,24 march 2018,cancer,"You’re a person on a mission and you want the world to know it. Problem is, people around you may becoming resentful. Maybe they sense that you’re going to be a success. Or perhaps they don’t want to go along with your ideas. Either way, they could mount resistance to you. Is it smarter just to push ahead and keep your mouth shut?

"
3395,25 march 2018,cancer,"Your confidence grows thanks to a spunky and passionate Moon-Jupiter connection! If you’re feeling more flirty, creative, fun-loving or adventurous, take that energy and run with it.

"
3396,26 march 2018,cancer,"With the Sun now in the most goal oriented part of your chart, you can make enormous headway over the next few weeks. But it appears that your habits and routines need an upgrade if you want to pull off a coup. Today is a good time to reflect; tomorrow is a smart time to start making changes.

"
3397,27 march 2018,cancer,"If money seems to constantly be slipping through your fingers, it’s time to start earning more and holding on to it. You may need to go down a completely different career path or change the way you’re doing things in your existing occupation. But the potential for making more is there if you seek it.

"
3398,28 march 2018,cancer,"A profitable new job or client could be hiding in plain sight, Cancer. So could an idea for a side business that you could start. Genius Uranus is in one hell of a good mood today, helping you locate bigger bucks and a more rewarding career. But nothing will happen if you don’t brainstorm.

"
3399,29 march 2018,cancer,"You’re becoming more and more motivated, Cancer, and this is a good thing. Just remember that you have to do what’s right for you. Dimming your light to keep other people satisfied doesn’t serve you in the long run, so maintain high standards.

"
3400,30 march 2018,cancer,"Be daring today, Cancer! Chiron, the wounded healer, is kicking up a fuss. It’s telling you to play it safe and hide in a bunker (or your shell). But La Luna knows better. Nothing worthwhile in life is achieved if all you do is play it safe.

"
3401,31 march 2018,cancer,"The full moon in Libra could ring things to a conclusion, especially matters of the heart and home. You may finally realize that peace of mind is more important than instability or arguing. If that’s the case, either set new boundaries or cut off the perps involved.

"
3402,1 april 2018,cancer,"Stepping in to your own power becomes easier with a potent Sun-Mercury meet-up. Use this strength to further your plans, talk to people who mean something to you and to feel more confident.

"
3403,2 april 2018,cancer,"Close relationships have a stop-and-go feeling about them, thanks to a wonky Mars-Saturn aspect. Don’t make any major decisions about love or your career if you can put them off. Some tense aspects later this week could actually be beneficial as they’ll provide clarity.

"
3404,3 april 2018,cancer,"Feeling frisky and feisty? You should be with an energetic Moon-Jupiter connection in one of the most fun-loving parts of your chart! It’s a great time for meeting new partners, be they the romantic or business kind.

"
3405,4 april 2018,cancer,"Asking for help or cooperation could fall flat today and tomorrow, Cancer. People are looking out for themselves. You have two choices: either do things on your own or make new connections with folks who are more willing to give.

"
3406,5 april 2018,cancer,"Rethinking a partnership or other commitment? It’s quite possible with a Mercury-Saturn square. If an alliance seems to be stacked in someone else’s favor, then it’s time to either demand parity or move on.

"
3407,6 april 2018,cancer,"Taking better care of your health is in the stars for you right now, Cancer. Its time to get serious about this and to treat it like a goal, not a passing interest. You may find it easier than you expect, so dive in.

"
3408,7 april 2018,cancer,"You may be having a gut feeling that you need to do something more significant with your life, Cancer. If that’s the case you should start aligning yourself with people who possess some of the qualities and interests that you aspire to.

"
3409,8 april 2018,cancer,"With lucky Jupiter in the most creative part of your chart, you should be trying to become more skilled at work. Likewise, your home environment and self-image could use a boost! But honey, you gotta own  it, and that’s the message from the cosmos today.

"
3410,9 april 2018,cancer,"Envy isn’t a pleasant state to be in, nor is it any fun if it’s being directed at you by someone else. The green eyed monster is out there today, so watch the tendency to be jealous or experience FOMO. And if anyone is acting a bit snippy toward you, give them all the space they need.

"
3411,10 april 2018,cancer,"From your chart it appears that you’ve been quite focused and rational lately. But the creative, emotional side of you is screaming to be acknowledged too. Have you forgotten how to be a vibrant human being, full of life and optimism?

"
3412,11 april 2018,cancer,"With Mars and Venus forming a cooperative aspect in the heavens, it’s a good time for searching out people who share the same values and dreams as yours. This is true in love as well as business. They say that opposites attract, but do they stay together? Find people who can go the distance.

"
3413,12 april 2018,cancer,"You may need to make it clear to others that you’re the boss of your own life, and that you don’t need or want their input. People may act as though they’re team players, trying to cooperate with you, but they’re really trying to push their own agenda. You won’t be falling for it!

"
3414,13 april 2018,cancer,"News flash: power struggles exist in relationships! OK, so that’s not really news. But a strong Pluto-Jupiter aspect helps you step into a place of greater authority without being obnoxious or domineering. People need to know that you respect yourself, which means that they must respect you too.

"
3415,14 april 2018,cancer,"Mercury will be resuming direct motion tomorrow in your ambition sector, and now is the time to get clear about what you’d like to achieve over the next few months. If you’re smart you’ll consider taking other people along on your journey, or at least picking their brains for advice. Trying to be a Lone Ranger could stall your progress.

"
3416,15 april 2018,cancer,"Get ready to kick it up a few notches, Cancer! Mercury finally goes direct today in your house of ambition, putting an end to confusion about the direction you should be heading in. Better yet is a new moon manana in your house of ambition and success. Release the brakes.

"
3417,16 april 2018,cancer,"Your ambition bolts forward now thanks to a glittering new moon in your career and goals sector. Don’t be surprised if you suddenly change your mind and rewrite your plans: unpredictable but brilliant Uranus is in a good angle, blessing you with some super new ideas that might be totally different than anything else you’ve previously considered.

"
3418,17 april 2018,cancer,"Your serious relationships will be tested for strength and longevity now that Saturn is retrograde in this part of your chart. The good news is that your goals are becoming clearer and you’re stepping into a position of greater self-esteem. Pluto will retrograde here in a few days, exposing power plays and ego trips, if they exist!

"
3419,18 april 2018,cancer,"To thine own self be true, Cancer! This is a day for showcasing your  talents and pursuing your goals, not those of other people. You may shock yourself with this attitude, considering how much of a nurturer you are. But your life can’t be about helping other people all of the time. Look out for #1.

"
3420,19 april 2018,cancer,"Your idea of what a true partnership is may be changing, Cancer. Or perhaps I should say your idea of the role that you play in alliances is up for review. If you’re a bossy type or a wimp, an enabler or a loner, it’s time to reconsider how you want things to be.

"
3421,20 april 2018,cancer,"Now that the Sun is in Taurus, the part of your chart that governs networking and friends, you should be reaching out to people in both your personal and professional lives. Chances are you’ll be craving independence though, not wanting to be tied down to a particular person or group. That’s OK. Be choosy!

"
3422,21 april 2018,cancer,"You’ll be in no mood for pushy people, not only today but over the next few months. No matter how diplomatic you are, no matter how much you give, there will always be people who want you to give more. Are they worth it? If not, it may be time to move on.

"
3423,22 april 2018,cancer,"Both Pluto and Saturn are now retrograde in your house of partnering, placing your closest relationships under a microscope. But you should also be focusing on your own attitudes and behavior when it comes to romantic or business alliances. A true partnership involves an equal balance of power, a positive give-and-take. Are you experiencing that?

"
3424,23 april 2018,cancer,"It’s critical to get clear about the “rules” of a relationship, Cancer. This is true of both personal and professional alliances. With the Moon in your house of structure and stability, you shouldn’t be flying by the seat of your pants.

"
3425,24 april 2018,cancer,"You may be more interested in keeping your thoughts to yourself rather than sharing them, Cancer. Venus has just entered the most secretive part of your chart. This hush-hush vibe could also pull you into the bedroom more frequently for some steamy romps in the sack. Funny—I don’t hear you complaining!

"
3426,25 april 2018,cancer,"Your intuition will be strong over the next few weeks along with your dream state and gut hunches. This is a big benefit, as there is a lot of energy focused on the next steps of your career and your love life. So don’t waste precious time: use that Spidey sense to your advantage.

"
3427,26 april 2018,cancer,"Power couple? You could become one thanks to a serious meeting of red hot Mars and energetic, influential Pluto. This isn’t only true in love; you could also form one hell of a profitable business alliance. With a full moon coming soon in the most fun and creative part of your chart, new (and established) connections could take an adventurous turn.

"
3428,27 april 2018,cancer,"Striking the right balance between your professional duties and your personal life could be an issue. The Moon opposes Mercury, creating a push-pull in which you may feel as though you’re not having as much fun as you’d like. That’s OK! The full moon on Monday falls in your house of flirting, romance, spending money on swag and going out to eat. It’s time to leave work behind at the office.

"
3429,28 april 2018,cancer,"Trying to keep the peace could be difficult, so don’t even try! The problem is that you might go into typical Cancer nurturer mode, meaning that others will walk all over you. You’ve been dealing with enough nonsense lately from others. It’s time for them to respect you for a change.

"
3430,29 april 2018,cancer,"Some long lasting connections could be made over the next week, the kind that will be life changing. Planetary activity in your chart indicates that exciting new people could come your way, but you need to be out there networking if you want to meet them. This includes new friends, business contacts, lovers or mentors. The more the merrier, right?

"
3431,30 april 2018,cancer,"Your love life gets a jolt of juicy electricity from tonight’s full moon in your romance sector! It’s time to start enjoying a lot more fun when it comes to amour, so if a relationship is boring as hell (or fraught with anger and drama) this is the best time all year to move on. Happily involved? Then book more “play dates” with your lover!

"
3432,1 may 2018,cancer,"Your creativity and optimism should be rising, thanks to a fabulous full moon yesterday in the house of talent. There should be no shortage of bright ideas going through that head of yours. The issue is that you may try to take on too much, like a little kid in a candy store. Create a short list and pursue those ideas to completion before moving on.

"
3433,2 may 2018,cancer,"Breaking old habits isn’t easy, especially crummy thought patterns. Gentle Venus is trying to help you close out the past and all the toxic crud associated with it, but for some reason today your ego might be holding on with all of its might. This passes quickly, however. Ask yourself which is more important: hanging on to the past, or having a brighter future?

"
3434,3 may 2018,cancer,"It’s time to go through your contact list and cut ties with people who just aren’t right for you anymore. Many times we hang on to attachments out of habit. With brilliant Taurus getting ready to enter your house of networking on the 15th, the company you keep is going to change dramatically—and the people will be movers and shakers.

"
3435,4 may 2018,cancer,"Knowing what you want out of love becomes so much easier due to a potent lunar aspect. This is true even if you’re single (start writing that short list!). One thing that’s obvious from your chart is that you’re not going to settle for drama and discord. Sometimes it’s not a good thing to have an unpredictable lover!

"
3436,5 may 2018,cancer,"Teamwork is a big theme running through your chart these days, and it’s a good idea to take a deep look into your connections. Are you being pushed around by others? Or are you acting like a bully? Is there ease, the ability to speak up and express your opinion? Take an inventory.

"
3437,6 may 2018,cancer,"There’s a fierce independent vibe around you these days, the kind that can move mountains. So if you’re looking to make major changes, things that yesterday may have seemed like a pipe dream, know that you have the chops to pull them off. But pick a mentor’s brain first before diving in.

"
3438,7 may 2018,cancer,"Criticism could come your way, but who cares! You’re on the right track and your detractors know it. Their remarks are just jealousy in disguise. Accept that fact, enjoy your life and let them stew.

"
3439,8 may 2018,cancer,"Team activities could get convoluted, so stay on top of things if you’re involved in one. There could be creative differences or unrealistic expectations about deadlines or expenses. Jealousy or snippy attitudes could arise. Things should smooth out next week when Mercury enters Taurus.

"
3440,9 may 2018,cancer,"Your opinions and ideas may be quite different from everyone else’s, but that’s OK! Actually, you’d be doing them a favor if you shared them with others. They seem to be stuck in a rut and could benefit from some fresh input.

"
3441,10 may 2018,cancer,"People think that you’re risk averse, like a little crab that wants to hide in its shell. But they don’t really know you! A spunky Moon-Neptune aspect will show them that you’re made of tougher, more riskier stuff.

"
3442,11 may 2018,cancer,"When brilliant Uranus glides into your house of teamwork next week, the company you keep will have a huge effect on your life, both personally and professionally. But you don’t have to wait till next week to make some important new connections. A Sun-Pluto trine today could introduce you to movers and shakers (and lovers!).

"
3443,12 may 2018,cancer,"Cooperation could be hard to come by with a messy Mercury-Mars square. Trying to force people into doing their share won’t work. Indeed, they may feel justified to be slacking off. Teamwork will be easier to come by as of tomorrow.

"
3444,13 may 2018,cancer,"Who can help you on your path through life, Cancer? Now that chatty Mercury is in your networking sector you really should start reaching out to other people. Friends could play matchmaker. A former colleague could tip you off about a job opening. BFFs could make you feel more alive. Mingle!

"
3445,14 may 2018,cancer,"Erratic Uranus has been touring your career and goals house for the past eight years, getting ready to move on (phew!) tomorrow. But before it goes it hits you with one last blast of inspiration. Pay attention to gut feelings or thoughts that might be popping into your mind. You might decide to do a 180.

"
3446,15 may 2018,cancer,"No more flying solo! Come out of your shell, Cancer. Rebellious Uranus is now in your house of camaraderie, encouraging you to team up with others for all reasons: finding love, furthering your career, having fun with pals or making the world a better place through volunteer work. Between now and 2026 your social circle will expand in ways that you simply can’t imagine.

"
3447,16 may 2018,cancer,"Most of us rely on technology in our careers, and the new moon falls in the house of all things futuristic. Over the next six months you can make enormous headway with your website, online store, blog or app. If you’re smart you’ll work with the energy of the planets and become as skilled as possible with technology. Online dating looks good too!

"
3448,17 may 2018,cancer,"The green eyed monster could raise its ugly little head today, so watch out for envy and snakiness. It’s not pretty regardless whether it’s coming from you or someone else. If someone is throwing shade your way, let it go. Venus enters your sign this weekend and you’ll have so much to look forward to that you won’t care.

"
3449,18 may 2018,cancer,"Finding people whom you can trust to work with in a team environment isn’t always easy. But thanks to a winning Saturn-Mercury combo, you’ll be able to connect with folks who get where you’re coming from—and know how to get the job done.

3642,1 december 2018,cancer,"If your head is spinning off your shoulders this week when it comes to romance, there is a good reason for it. Mercury retrogrades today into your house of love, making you question what is going on. But tomorrow amorous Venus glides into the same sector, turning up the heat! Fortunately this scene should settle down by the 12th. Don’t make any major decisions until then.

"
3643,2 december 2018,cancer,"Venus glides into your house of romance today, but you won’t have moon dust sprinkled in your eyes. Nor will there be any rainbows and unicorns in your general vicinity. You are into too practical a mindset for that, which is fine. You need a romance that is built on a stable foundation.

"
3644,3 december 2018,cancer,"Big plans require vision, but they also need attention to detail and strategy. And today you may overlook that fact. Make sure that you’re not moving too quickly.

"
3646,5 december 2018,cancer,"Health is one of the most valuable assets that we have, and you need to protect yours. Avoid fads and crazy remedies. Stay away from boot camp type exercise programs that are promising a new body in 6 weeks. Slow and steady is the way to go.

"
3647,6 december 2018,cancer,"If the lines of communication  have been tangled up with a lover, your kids or teammates, expect some improvement.

"
3651,10 december 2018,cancer,"You may be trying to make sense out of what a child or lover is doing or saying. If that’s the case, try a different tactic today. If you approach the problem from the same old direction you won’t get anywhere. Surprise them; it will pay off!

"
3652,11 december 2018,cancer,"You should be proud of what you’ve achieved: no one can take that away from you! But for your chart it appears that you can go even further if you develop your skills. What would that require? Taking a class? A seminar? More studio time? Figure out what it is and then do it.

"
3653,12 december 2018,cancer,"You’re in one of the most organized, efficient times ever, so take advantage of it. There was a new moon in this part of your chart last week, and today Mercury glides into this sector. Try to get caught up with as much stuff as possible by the 21st.

"
3654,13 december 2018,cancer,"There could be a difference of opinion today and it could be huge. As a result you could find yourself surrounded by people who don’t support you. The question is this: do you want to get involved in this? Sometimes it’s best to not get involved.

"
3655,14 december 2018,cancer,"You may feel like chucking your daily routine so that you can play instead, and if that’s the case, you have the cosmos’ approval! A zesty Moon-Mars connection could prompt you to call in sick….forget about the work on your desk or the chores at home….ignore your diet….and basically be a lazy slug. Who am I to criticize you?!

"
3656,15 december 2018,cancer,"Right now there is a strong emphasis for becoming better educated, Cancer. This doesn’t only mean going to college or grad school. Maybe you should go to a seminar or take an online course. Maybe you just need to hang out with people who have the kind of skills you admire. Doctors and surgeons routinely take continuing education ed classes so they can perform at the highest level. What about you?

"
3657,16 december 2018,cancer,"With the full moon approaching this weekend in your sign, you definitely want to know where things are heading. You want answers. You want clarity. You want commitment. Today is a smart time to do a lot of thinking, and communicating.

"
3658,17 december 2018,cancer,"With motivator Mars in the most free thinking part of your chart, you’re becoming positively visionary! “Aha!” moments could be hitting you left and right as you realize things about all  aspects of your life. This is especially true when it comes to your relationships with others. This feeling will intensify, as this Saturday’s full moon will occur in your sign.

"
3659,18 december 2018,cancer,"The universe is hell bent on getting you out of a funk. Transformational Pluto and motivator Mars are on the case. Think boot camp instructors, and you’ll have the right idea. “Get your sorry ass moving there, soldier!” is their battle cry. If you’re smart you’ll listen to them.

"
3660,19 december 2018,cancer,"There is a time and place for everything, and today is not the time to break the rules. Just do what you have to do to keep people happy. By Friday you’ll be able to do your own thing.

"
3662,21 december 2018,cancer,"Some lively cosmic aspects could bring new people into your life over the next four weeks. They will be a break from the usual types you tend to attract. This isn’t to say that your existing tribe is no good; just that you could benefit from some fresh viewpoints.

People are swigging eggnog and wishing each other good cheer. Do you sense my sarcasm? Yeah. Actually, people in your circle could be pretty damn opinionated today.

"
3668,27 december 2018,cancer,"Your opinions count, Cancer. So don’t be afraid to say what’s on your mind! Not everyone will agree with you, but it’s not your job to change their way of thinking. All you can do is present your ideas.

"
3669,29 december 2018,cancer,"“Life is either a daring adventure, or it is nothing.” This quote attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt applies to you today, Cancer. With motivational Mars spending a few last days in your house of taking risks, it’s time to stop playing it so safe.

"
3670,30 december 2018,cancer,"There could be some last minute action surrounding your job, so be prepared. Maybe a client needs something ASAP. Or perhaps you hear about a job opportunity somewhere, and you need to move quickly. Don’t assume that the world is grinding to a halt because a holiday weekend is here.

"
3671,4 january 2018,leo,"Mercury glides into your efficiency sector today, making it even easier to dive into your 2019 resolutions (plus the dirty laundry and the work on your desk at the office).

"
3672,8 march 2018,leo,"Feeling comfortable in your own skin is going to become significantly more important over the next four months.

3673,9 march 2018,leo,"What is it that you were put on this planet to achieve, Leo? There will be no holding you back with a Moon-Mars meet-up. You may feel at times that you’re out of your comfort zone, but that’s a part of growing and changing.

"
3674,10 march 2018,leo,"You might be overestimating what can be achieved in a day, month or a year. From your chart it appears that you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself these days, Leo. Slow down before your physical and mental health take a hit.

"
3675,11 march 2018,leo,"You’re a fixed sign, Leo, which means that you don’t make changes easily. Today’s one of those day when your logical mind is telling you to switch things up, but you’re stubbornly holding on to old viewpoints and habits. But consider the advantages to making the changes happen.

"
3676,12 march 2018,leo,"Creativity is your forte, Leo, and today you could come up with genius ideas, seemingly out of the blue! The reality is that your brain is hard wired for artistic or cutting edge expression. Open up the gates to your subconscious mind and see what you come up with.

"
3677,13 march 2018,leo,"There’s a strong spiritual vibe going on in your chart right now, lion. It’s not so much about connecting with a higher source, but rather connecting with your own inner voice. Pay more attention to what it  says to you than what other people do. If need be, shut out the noise so that your personal wisdom can flow.

"
3678,14 march 2018,leo,"Trying to push square pegs into round holes just doesn’t work, Leo, especially when it comes to people. No matter how much you want them to change or do things your way, that doesn’t mean that they’ll conveniently do so. Just worry about yourself for now and let things take their own course.

"
3679,15 march 2018,leo,"Benjamin Franklin used to say, “Take care of the pennies and the dollars will take care of themselves.” That’s good advice for you, Leo. Create a new habit of cutting back your spending on small stuff, because over time it adds up to a lot. This week’s new moon is all about building wealth.

"
3680,16 march 2018,leo,"Feeling sexy and sultry? You should be with the passionate Moon cuddling up to amorous Neptune. Don’t feel shy about strutting your stuff, Leo. Make ‘em sweat and beg for more.

3681,17 march 2018,leo,"A sparkling new moon in Pisces is just the ticket for more fulfilling romance and making mo’ money—nothing to complain about, right? Pisces is your eighth house of intimacy, sex and wealth, always a loaded ticket. Over the next six months you can make headway in both areas.

"
3682,18 march 2018,leo,"Today may seem like a sunny day when the clouds suddenly roll in and block out the light, then disappear. On, off, on, off…that’s how your emotions may flow. This too shall pass. Once the Sun enters Aries on Tuesday your optimism will return and become more of a steady force.

"
3683,19 march 2018,leo,"From your chart it appears that you’re in need of some extreme self care. And since your sign is known for loving luxury and pampering, this shouldn’t be too much of a problem!

"
3684,20 march 2018,leo,"Nothing ventured, nothing gained! With the Sun in the most optimistic part of your chart, you’re ready to roll and roar! But considering that Mercury will retrograde on Thursday in the same sector, you need to slow down and take one step at a time. You can pounce after Mercury goes direct on April 15th.

"
3685,21 march 2018,leo,"Your sign is famous for being creative and talented, whether you’re a doctor, dancer or computer programmer. And regardless as to how good you are at what you do, you should consider deepening your skill set. Sign up for a class or seminar. Listen to podcasts. Read books. Become even greater.

"
3686,22 march 2018,leo,"Slow down there, Leo! The Sun just entered the most adventurous part of your chart, making you anxious to live life to the fullest. But Mercury goes retrograde in the same sector. There are only 24 hours in a day and you can’t start a jillion projects at once. Stay on top of travel details too.

"
3687,23 march 2018,leo,"Your optimism should be soaring thanks to happy planets in your house of open thinking and taking risks, but the trolls are out in force over the next few days. They’ll try to burst your bubble, but they won’t have any luck. You know where you’re heading, and they’ll be left behind in the dust.

"
3688,24 march 2018,leo,"You’re feeling might impatient these days, Leo. And with the Sun in the most turbocharged part of your chart, you won’t appreciate anyone or anything that slows your roll. But if you push too hard people may decide to block your progress. Can you afford to make any enemies?

"
3690,26 march 2018,leo,"It’s a good day to lay low, Leo. Don’t put all of your cards on the table–let others wonder what you’re up to. Knowledge is power, and you need to gain the upper hand.

"
3691,27 march 2018,leo,"What is your destiny, Leo? That’s the question the cosmos asks of you today. If you’re not happy with the way your life is going, know that your destiny was pre-set before you were born. Which means you don’t have to settle for crappy circumstances now.

"
3692,28 march 2018,leo,"Something’s going to light a fire under that languid feline a** of yours, something exciting and cutting edge. It seems that you’ve been playing things a little too safe lately. Break away from restricting people and circumstances, if only in your mind. Make new plans and figure out how to pull them off!

"
3693,29 march 2018,leo,"Today’s a smart time to slow down and review your progress. Whether it’s with your grades at school, your diet, a business plan or creating something new, you need to consider the long view. Maintain your optimism about the future but plan the days and weeks ahead.

"
3694,30 march 2018,leo,"Try to remain focused on the present moment rather than “awfulizing” what might be coming next. Mindfulness techniques can really help. There’s a wonderful free 8-week mindfulness program online at www.palousemindfulness.com. (I have no affiliation with them!)

"
3695,31 march 2018,leo,"The time has come to stop talking about doing things and actually DO them, Leo. Tonight’s full moon in your communication sector indicates that talk is cheap. Venus glides into the most ambitious part of your chart, saying, “OK, fierce feline…you gonna start crushing it, or not?”

"
3696,1 april 2018,leo,"Mentally, climb to a high mountain peak and take a bigger view of your life. Recognize the “small stuff” (and people) for what they are–small. You’ve been in the dark forest for too long. Get to that summit and stay there.

"
3697,2 april 2018,leo,"With so much planetary action in your house of getting organized, you may realize that it’s time to get off your duff and do  something. Which is good! But you need to pick one project and complete it before you move on to the next. Otherwise you’ll have your fingers in too many pies.

"
3698,3 april 2018,leo,"Confucius is best known for his golden rule: treat others the way you’d like to be treated. Today’s aspects pass his wisdom on to you, Leo. Be generous, polite and kind. The laws of karma will see that it comes back to you.

"
3699,4 april 2018,leo,"Multitasking may sound  like a good idea, but you run the risk of taking on too much. Blame it on energetic Mars in your efficiency sector, which could push you into burning the candle at both ends. Slow down before you burn out.

"
3700,5 april 2018,leo,"They say that old habits die hard, and that’s true for your sign right now. Over the next week you’ll be forced to examine if all of your routines are actually as smart and efficient as you think they are. This coming weekend is a good time to start some new ones.

"
3701,6 april 2018,leo,"A sudden burst of mental energy gives you a new viewpoint about your life and where you’re heading. Why continue to do things the same old way when new methods might work better? Consider some fresh options.

"
3702,7 april 2018,leo,"You’re feeling more grounded these days thanks to wise Saturn setting up shop in the most practical part of your chart. Now it’s time to start applying that practicality to all areas of your life. Get them under control and you’ll feel a lot less stressed.

"
3704,10 april 2018,leo,"It’s not your karma in life to be someone else’s rescuer, so get that idea out of your head right now. Just focus on getting your own act together. Others are responsible for their own lives.

"
3705,11 april 2018,leo,"Remember that old childhood saying, “Every party has a pooper, that’s why we invited you”? Yup, it’s that kind of a day, leo.

"
3706,12 april 2018,leo,"You’re highly motivated to get things done, and no one is going to be able to stop you. The great thing is that things may actually fall into place far more easily than you might have expected. Momentum becomes even greater at the time of the new moon on the 16th.

3707,13 april 2018,leo,"Leos love their lairs, so living in a beautiful place is important to you. The next few days are super for some home improvement, whether that means cleaning out the closets (not fun but necessary) or buying gorgeous new stuff (lots of fun and absolutely necessary).

"
3708,14 april 2018,leo,"You may have felt lately as though you’ve been slogging though knee deep mud, and if that’s the case you can blame it on Mercury being retrograde.

"
3709,15 april 2018,leo,"With so much planetary activity in your house of getting organized, you may be feeling as though all you do is errands and grunt work.

"
3711,17 april 2018,leo,"“Quality is not an act; it is a habit.” So said Aristotle a long  time ago, and he was right. Leo, your sign is all about quality, and if you want more in your life you’ll need to upgrade your daily efforts. Today disciplined Saturn begins to retrograde in your house of efficiency, pointing out areas that need improvement.

"
3712,18 april 2018,leo,"RAWR!!  Today’s mantra is “Everyone is entitled to my  opinion”, and honey, you won’t be shy about expressing it. This isn’t about being a diva. It’s more about expressing ideas of yours that others may not be able to wrap their little brains around. You’re in a brilliant state right now in which your mind is coming up with cutting edge ideas. Make the most of them.

"
3713,19 april 2018,leo,"It’s always fun to daydream but at some point you need to come back down to Earth. You will today, but it will be a gentle drop, not a crash-and-burn. You’re entering into a very practical phase and it’s important to see things clearly.

"
3715,21 april 2018,leo,"If you’re thinking about going into weekend warrior mode with your fitness routine, think again!

Consider a different plan.

"
3716,22 april 2018,leo,"2018 is going to be remembered as the year that you got your life together. Disciplined Saturn just went retrograde in your house of habits and efficiency, and today Pluto does the same. Over the next few months you’re going to become a super productive dynamo.

"
3717,23 april 2018,leo,"From your chart it appears that you’ve been pushing yourself hard, Leo. That’s not a surprise considering how much planetary activity you have going on in your efficiency sector. But right now you’re running the risk of burning out. This little lion needs to play!

"
3718,24 april 2018,leo,"From your chart it looks like you could benefit from having new friends, and you could meet them over the next few weeks. If you’ve been thinking about leaving one field of work and entering another, reach out to people. If they’re not local you should join online forums, private Facebook groups or listen to podcasts.

"
3719,25 april 2018,leo,"Play by the rules today, even if you have better ideas about the ways that things should be handled. You’re dealing with some Luddites who are stuck in the past.

"
3720,26 april 2018,leo,"One of your greatest strengths right now is to sniff out ways of getting things done smarter, faster and cheaper than everyone else.

"
3721,27 april 2018,leo,"It ain’t easy being a god or goddess, but somebody’s gotta do it and it’s looking like you, Leo. Unfortunately the trolls and the wannabes are out there in force today.

"
3723,29 april 2018,leo,"Making progress in your career is possible, but you have to be able to show the powers that be that you have the tenacity, discipline and habits to be a winner. That shouldn’t be any problem with today’s Sun-Saturn connection! Polish up your resume, clear off your desk, catch up on unfinished projects and come up with time and money saving ideas. Self-employed lions should do the same.

"
3724,30 april 2018,leo,"Family and residential matters take center stage with tonight’s full moon in your domestic sector. Something important may finally come to a successful close, such as negotiations to buy a place, or putting an end to a family dispute.

"
3725,1 may 2018,leo,"A conflict is brewing between the Moon and Uranus, one that may make you feel as though you’re being pulled in two directions. Uranus is telling you to go big and bold, while the Moon craves comfort and stability. The good news is that as of May 15th Uranus moves to a place where you can have your cake and eat it too.

"
3726,2 may 2018,leo,"Remain centered today, Leo. The people around you could be acting out due to a Moon-Venus opposition, and they may not be above pettiness and jealousy. Just put on that invisible crown and go sit on your throne.

"
3727,3 may 2018,leo,"Cats will always land on their feet, but lately your balance seems to be off. From your chart it appears that other people are the cause of your agita, rather than health issues or other personal problems.

"
3729,5 may 2018,leo,"Keep your ego in check, Leo! A Moon-Pluto meet up could make up feel a bit arrogant. Yeah, we know, you’re the king of the jungle. But you do your best work when you silently sit back on your haunches, ready to pounce on your prey, rather than making a lot of noise.

"
3732,8 may 2018,leo,"You’re in quite an authoritative mood and place right now (and why not?) but other people may not like it one bit. Let ‘em stew. Their expectations of you seem to be unrealistic and it’s not up to you to set them straight.

3737,14 may 2018,leo,"Keep an open mind today, Leo. You’re a fixed sign, which means that you can resist change. But spunky Uranus is on a campaign to download some expansive ideas into that brain of yours, and they could be winners. Tomorrow Uranus moves on to your house of goals, a place it will be till 2026!

"
3738,15 may 2018,leo,"Hope you’re well rested! Unconventional Uranus powers into your career and goals sector, shaking things up all the way into 2026. Chances are your life path will change dramatically, and you’ll be scoring wins that may have seemed unconceivable to you in the past.

"
3739,16 may 2018,leo,"There is so much planetary energy going on in your ambition sector it’s making my head spin. Seriously, Leo, now’s the time to go after your heart’s desire! Spunky Uranus entered this sector yesterday and now there’s a new moon in the same house. Between now and November you should plow ahead and achieve as much as possible. Your efforts will pay off for years to come.

"
3740,17 may 2018,leo,"Playing nice with others and being diplomatic will be difficult today, Leo! Now that spunky Uranus is in your goals sector, you’re becoming more focused on your own agenda, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Other people may try to pull you off track. Don’t let this happen.

"
3741,18 may 2018,leo,"Procrastinating? Messy desk at home or work? Muffin top? Disciplined Saturn entered your house of habits and efficiency months ago, and it’s going to whip your sorry butt into shape. The good news is that the ringed planet forms a fabulous aspect today with intelligent Mercury, helping you to quickly move into a more productive mindset.

"
3742,19 may 2018,leo,"Your sign is famous for its creativity and passion, and both of these attributes are about to increase. Lush Venus enters your house of romance and talent, a place it will remain for three weeks. You may feel the need to pull away from the crowd a little bit in order to devote more time to your skills and love life.

"
3743,20 may 2018,leo,"The Sun has just entered your house of values and cherished dreams, placing some of your biggest desires on center stage. It would be smart to seek the wisdom from people who have traveled down a similar path before you. But be selective about whom you confide in as Venus is in your house of hush hush matters.

"
3744,21 may 2018,leo,"A lot of times we procrastinate about making changes because we don’t feel like being forced into them. Even though we’re adults, we can feel as though some stern parent is out there, yelling at us to clean up our acts! Fortunately the Moon is in Leo today, actually making you want  to do this…for your own peace of mind.

"
3745,22 may 2018,leo,"The Taurus season is your annual goal-a-thon, and brilliant little Mercury is stirring up your brain waves. If making more money (the serious kind) is on your agenda, know that your inspiration level will be high over the next week, not to mention your creativity. The full moon on the 29th could be a turning point in which you head off in an exciting and profitable new direction.

"
3746,23 may 2018,leo,"Don’t get too cocky today, Leo. Abundant Jupiter may trick you into thinking you can move mountains. It’s one thing to be self-confident and another one to be unrealistic or overbearing. Friday is a better time for clarity.

"
3747,24 may 2018,leo,"How well you cooperate with others is going to be an important factor over the next few weeks, Leo. You can often be a lone warrior, but sometimes ya just gotta play nice with others and feel like you’re part of a team. Fortunately a terrific Mars-Sun trine enables you to do so. Besides, you have wisdom that others can benefit from.

"
3748,25 may 2018,leo,"Your mental and spiritual development are becoming more important to you as you realize that there’s more to life than swag and climbing the ladder. A magnificent and rare Jupiter-Neptune trine helps you dig down deep and find your own personal well of contentment and solitude. This aspect repeats again on August 19th, so use the time in between to develop a strong base.

"
3749,26 may 2018,leo,"You have a lot more potential inside of you than you realize, something that the cosmos is trying to point out to you. One of the biggest themes running through your chart over the next few years is that you need to develop better habits and systems if you want to progress—and this includes your emotions too. Today is wonderful for stepping into a more influential place.

"
3750,27 may 2018,leo,"Something (or someone) could tempt you to break a healthy new habit you’re developing, Leo. Maybe it’s that jelly donut that’s calling your name. Or the designer clothes you’re craving. Or a friend who’s urging you to toss back another margarita. Whatever it is, don’t succumb. You’re on a roll and need to develop even more momentum.

"
3751,28 may 2018,leo,"Leos are a fixed sign, which means that you don’t like big changes happening. Your comfort level is based on things remaining the same. A Moon-Mercury opposition today could make you feel a bit off, as someone or something could rattle you. Tomorrow’s upcoming full moon in your house of drama isn’t helping! But this will all pass within a few days.

"
3752,29 may 2018,leo,"An important new phase of your life opens up courtesy of tonight’s full moon. Expect new people to show up, people who can bring wisdom your way. There could also be new lovers, BFFs and partners in crime. Your creativity will sky rocket along the way, so embrace opportunities to develop your talents.

"
3753,30 may 2018,leo,"The glow of yesterday’s full moon in the most dramatic, fun-filled part of your chart  is still there, Leo. But don’t become so starry-eyed that you become someone’s next target! This is true in any area of your life: romantically, financially, career, you name it. Keep a level head about you and don’t let anyone push you into anything.

"
3754,31 may 2018,leo,"You don’t have to kill yourself to get ahead, Leo. Logical Saturn meets up with the Moon today, holding a discussion about your work load. You may think that you’re a bottomless pit of energy, but hello!!!! You’re not. The recent full moon occurred in your house of living la vida loca. It’s playtime, babe.

"
3755,1 june 2018,leo,"Planets are active in your technology sector, Leo, suggesting that you up your internet game. We all rely on technology in one way or another, but in your case, learning how to finesse it can add to your efficiency and increase your income. It’s also a good time to find love online.

"
3756,2 june 2018,leo,"Trust is something that is not easily earned, whether you’re learning to count on someone else or your own wisdom. A fortuitous Venus-Neptune aspect makes it easier for you to toss aside your fears and believe in yourself, as well as others.

"
3757,3 june 2018,leo,"You can tend to be a solitary creature, not entirely trusting others. After all, you’re a fierce predator, and that attitude is built into your DNA! But planetary activity is pushing you to work more with others. Don’t worry, you’ll still maintain your autonomy.

"
3758,4 june 2018,leo,"Coming into contact with the right kind of people becomes easier with today’s Sun-Mercury conjunction. You have what it takes, so much so that you run the risk of attracting wannabes or kiss asses who will try to impress you. Be choosy and take your time getting to know people.

"
3759,5 june 2018,leo,"Sometimes you have to pick your battles, and today is one of those times, Leo. Someone with an attitude may try to push you around and your nature feline response will be to pounce and rip the dumb ass to shreds. But they’re not worth it, so let this pass.

"
3760,6 june 2018,leo,"Murky Neptune is in a wonky mood from your house of wealth, which is something you need to watch out for. Be especially careful when it comes to trusting others, as they may try to mislead you. If possible, avoid making major financial decisions until the 13th, when profit-conscious Venus glides into Leo.

"
3761,7 june 2018,leo,"Don’t succumb to envy today, Leo! Everyone is so busy making their lives look fab on social media, so it’s easy to fall into this trap. However, you can use envy to your advantage. It is often pointing out areas of our lives that are lacking, but it’s up to you to make those changes.

"
3762,8 june 2018,leo,"The past few days may have been somewhat emo as confusing Neptune was acting up in your house of feelings. Clear the cobwebs out of your head and adjust your attitude (if that requires the aid of a cocktail or two, so be it!). The weekend is here and the Moon is in the most free-wheeling part of your chart.

"
3763,9 june 2018,leo,"Nitpicking? According to your chart either you or someone close is getting way too particular! Yes, details are important, but sometimes you just have to look at the bigger picture.

"
3764,10 june 2018,leo,"Momentum is developing in your life, Leo, but it may not be apparent right now. Interesting things are happening behind the scenes. Once Mercury changes signs on Tuesday you’ll start to get a glimpse of what’s happening.

"
3765,11 june 2018,leo,"The planets are recommending that you just let certain things go, Leo. Your inner peace is too important a commodity to be upset by stupid people or situations. With shrewd Mercury touring the sector that governs your subconscious mind, you should be looking into mindfulness techniques and meditation.

"
3766,12 june 2018,leo,"Hmmmm….does someone have a secret? It sure looks that way! Keep things on the hush-hush side, Leo, as chatty Mercury is now in your house of confidential matters. This may not be easy as glamorous Venus enters your sign tomorrow. Go the Mata Hari route: be charismatic, sexy and a total freakin’ mystery.

"
3767,13 june 2018,leo,"Yeah, baby! It may not be your birthday season yet but the cosmos is getting the party started. Glam girl Venus glides into Leo, accompanied by a new moon in the house of friends and networking. This is one heck of an auspicious sign for showing off your bad self in a social setting, whether you’re looking for love or a new job. But don’t go overboard: Mercury is in your house of confidentiality, urging you to keep juicy tidbits to yourself.

"
3768,14 june 2018,leo,"With magnetic Venus in your sign, you’re sure to attract a lot of attention. But not everyone will be happy about this, and they may decide to burst your bubble. I wish them luck. As long as you avoid the trolls, malcontents and divas you’ll be fine.

"
3769,15 june 2018,leo,"You’re in a pretty vibey place these days, thanks to Mercury transiting your house of the subconscious mind. But keep your observations to yourself as Mercury opposes logical Saturn. Your psychic hits could be dead on, but you’ll be met with ridicule from people who think that the sixth sense is a load of bull.

"
3770,16 june 2018,leo,"There is a LOT going on behind the scenes, Leo! From today through next Saturday you could become privy to some juicy intel. Your intuition is sharp, so use it to suss out what’s going on. Anything that you need to do confidentially, such as looking for a new job, should be done this week. Stealth is your MO after all!

"
3771,17 june 2018,leo,"An attitude adjustment seems to be in order, Leo. Or perhaps I should say an “emotional realignment”. You don’t need to continue going through life reacting to everyone and everything with your typical knee jerk reactions. Pull away from the crowd and chill out.

"
3772,18 june 2018,leo,"A very vibey, highly intuitive time begins as dreamy Neptune begins to retrograde in one of the most cerebral parts of your chart. Things will become even more intense as the Sun moves into Cancer on Thursday. Your intuition will be heightened but don’t act on it too quickly; use logic too, as Neptune can create mixed signals.

"
3773,19 june 2018,leo,"Our internal sense of balance can be affected by so many factors, such as the state of our health, finances, love life and family connections. Something positive will happen today that will result in a greater feeling of calm and contentment. Other people around you may seem off balance, but you’ll be as solid as a rock.

"
3774,20 june 2018,leo,"From your chart it appears that you have a number of things going on behind the scenes. This could be anything from a confidential job hunt to a secret crush to doing much needed inner work on your psyche. Today is a wonderful time to make progress, so set aside time for whatever it is. Once the Sun enters Cancer tomorrow things will pick up speed.

"
3775,21 june 2018,leo,"It’s time to hole up in your lair, Leo! Not only is the Sun now in the most secluded part of your chart, a Venus-Mars opposition today finds you questioning just how much “together time” you really want to spend with other people. Over the next few weeks you may choose to hang out with only trusted friends or family members, people who you know have your back.

"
3776,22 june 2018,leo,"Brilliant Uranus is now in your career sector for the first time in over 80 years, and it’s going to be around for awhile! But things heat up today with a sparkling Sun-Uranus aspect. Someone may be working on your behalf behind the scenes. Or maybe you hit upon a genius idea for a business, or how to score a promotion. When Mercury enters your money house on the 29th, it’s time to move ahead with these opportunities.

"
3777,23 june 2018,leo,"You’re a fearless lion and not the kind to sit back and let others be the boss, but that’s exactly what you should do today. Let others prance around and act important. They’ll be doing that all of next week too, so get used to it. You’re better off doing your own thing quietly, behind the scenes.

"
3778,24 june 2018,leo,"You’ve been biting off more than you can chew, so slow down a bit, Leo! Yes, there may be lots of things you want to get done in a day but you run the risk of burning out. The full moon on Thursday will help you become more efficient.

"
3779,25 june 2018,leo,"Playing by somebody else’s rules has never been your strong point, and today you’ll feel it big time! Others may resort to (empty) promises or try to flatter you, but don’t fall for it. There’s a time and place to cooperate and now isn’t that time….which is too bad for them!

"
3780,26 june 2018,leo,"Just how much togetherness do you need in a relationship, Leo? Activity in your chart indicates that you may be craving more alone time over the next few weeks. If anyone is too clingy or demanding you’ll be tempted to silence them with a mighty roar. You need a team player, not someone who needs a baby sitter.

"
3781,27 june 2018,leo,"You’re about to break free from some confining situations, and you’ll be able to breathe a sigh of relief. But not everyone around you will be pleased that you’re on the verge of moving ahead, so keep an eye out for malcontents who may try to stall your progress.

"
3782,28 june 2018,leo,"Ready to move on to better working conditions, perhaps even a new job? The full moon in Capricorn could bring about positive new changes for you, and heaven knows you deserve them. But there could be hidden resistance from someone, so stay on your toes.

"
3783,29 june 2018,leo,"Yaasss!!! Your birthday season comes a little early as vivacious Mercury zips into Leo. The next few weeks are awesome for showing off what you’ve got, whether that’s in a personal setting or a business one. You’re in a practical mood these days and ready to dig into new projects, and people will notice your can-do attitude.

"
3784,30 june 2018,leo,"It may be the weekend but the planets are focused on your career and workplace. Flexibility is going to be required between now and Tuesday, as unpredictable Uranus will be stirring things up. The smartest thing you can do is to lay low and act like a team player.

"
3785,1 july 2018,leo,"With glamorous Venus in your sign until the 9th, you should be working on a makeover, which includes fitness of course! A strong Pluto-Venus aspect encourages you to create better habits. The good news is that you’ll be able to stick to them.

"
3786,2 july 2018,leo,"Some big changes on the work front are happening, and they may require some adjustments from you. More responsibility could come your way, but the good news is that this will put you in a stronger position career wise. The decisions you make will have long lasting effects, so choose wisely.

"
3787,3 july 2018,leo,"It’s a wonderful day for getting emotions out in the open. This naturally applies to you, but it could also mean that you’ll end up being a good friend to someone else who needs to vent. There is a terrific healing energy going on into next week, and it’s going to magnify once Jupiter goes direct on the 10th.

"
3788,4 july 2018,leo,"Your sign loves love and loves the good life, and you’re in the mood for some fun escapades! A juicy Moon-Neptune aspect could bring you some delights….just make sure that they don’t cost too much!

"
3789,5 july 2018,leo,"As a fixed sign you tend to get set in your ways, and that includes the way you think. From your chart it appears that you really need to do a mental “cleansing”. Don’t be too proud to think that you’re above it; even a lion needs to recalibrate their brains now and then.

"
3790,6 july 2018,leo,"You’ll be in no mood today if others try to tell you what to do. But fortunately, silver-tongued Mercury is in your sign, so instead of ripping them a new one, you’ll be able to politely tell them to back off.

"
3791,7 july 2018,leo,"The next week is going to be a big one, in part due to a solar eclipse on the 13th in your house of endings. Today you might start getting fidgety about your career or another big goal, but this is a good sign. You need a major change, and in order to do so, the old garbage has to go.

"
3792,8 july 2018,leo,"This is the best time all year to do some serious inner work, Leo. The Sun and Neptune are conspiring today to bring you greater peace and contentment. Consider the possibilities: mindfulness meditation, Zen Buddhism, joining a support group or getting involved at your church. .

"
3793,9 july 2018,leo,"There’s a lot going on behind the scenes this week, Leo. Today profitable Venus glides into your house of earning more money. The time is right for conducting research and making quiet inquiries. Keep everything hush-hush, especially at the time of the eclipse on Friday.

"
3794,10 july 2018,leo,"This week there are a lot of planetary aspects designed to make you feel more comfortable in your own skin, Leo. A fabulous one occurs today as healing Jupiter goes direct in your house of contentment. It’s time to start dwelling in your own private temple of peace and serenity, metaphorically speaking.

"
3795,11 july 2018,leo,"Do you truly love what you do for living, Leo? If you do, then a happy Venus aspect should help you find even more enjoyment in your career. But if you’re not thrilled to pieces, a surprising and positive development could occur. Be on the lookout for a new opportunity that could come from left field.

"
3796,12 july 2018,leo,"The dreams and plans that you hold most dear may end up getting challenged by other people today, Virgo. Actually, they could put up resistance for several weeks. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse falls in your house of cherished dreams and closely held values. Don’t compromise anything that is important to you to keep other people happy.

"
3797,13 july 2018,leo,"Adios! Buh-bye! Don’t let the door hit you on the rear on the way out. Yeah, it’s time to take out the trash. A solar eclipse in your house of closure and transition sets the stage for clearing out the cobwebs from your life. That includes negative people, bad habits and anything else that maybe holding you back. You won’t be sorry to see them go.

"
3798,14 july 2018,leo,"Yesterdays solar eclipse fell in your house of habits, Leo. It’s time to dive headlong into a new series of routines. With take-it-easy Venus in a good spot, this should take place more quickly than you may realize.

"
3799,15 july 2018,leo,"Yesterday’s eclipse occurred in your house of closure and moving on, Leo. And the action starts right away! You might want to start with your financial situation and your career. Don’t settle for earning less than you deserve, or being stifled by a job that doesn’t suit you. Start making other plans.

"
3800,16 july 2018,leo,"Your birthday season is almost here, and the one thing that you probably crave more than anything else is stability. You’re a fixed sign, which means that you desire strength and knowing what’s going on. But this feeling is amplified as Venus is cruising through your second house of ritual and security. Drama is not your thing right now.

"
3801,17 july 2018,leo,"Situations that may not have worked out well in the past could be affecting your current confidence level, Leo. But just because you’ve dealt with some disappointments does not mean that they are going to continue. Once the Sun enters your sign next Sunday your attitude will improve dramatically.

"
3802,18 july 2018,leo,"The Sun is getting ready to enter your sign, and you’re getting ready to claim what is yours! You are determined to do something worthwhile with your life, and small minded people are starting to get on your nerves. Leave them in the dust, Leo. You’ve got bigger fish to fry.

"
3803,19 july 2018,leo,"Watch that you don’t say the wrong thing to the wrong person, Leo. Right now you need to come off as a team player. I know that this goes against your typical regal attitude, but if you roar too loudly you could offend someone is a decision-maker.

"
3804,20 july 2018,leo,"It seems like you’ve been putting plenty of time and effort into a project with strong long-term possibilities, Leo. Keep at it! The Sun enters your sign in two days, and then all systems will be go.

"
3805,21 july 2018,leo,"Just one more day until the Sun enters your sign! The cosmos delivers an early birthday present your way, with a happy aspect between the two most beneficial planets, Venus and Jupiter. They are in houses that deal with stability, the emotional kind and the financial kind. Gotta love it!

"
3806,22 july 2018,leo,"Yaasss!!!! Pop open a bottle of champagne and toast yourself, Leo. The Sun is now in your sign. Chances are you’re ready to chase after some new adventures and initiatives. But slow down and think things through, as Mercury will retrograde in Leo this Thursday.

"
3807,23 july 2018,leo,"Your emotions could get the better of you today, Leo. The emotional Moon is in the most dramatic part of your chart, and it is in a tense angle with deceptive Neptune. People could push your buttons very easily. Or you could create your own tempest in a teapot. Its birthday season, babe…why are you all in a lather?

"
3808,24 july 2018,leo,"Relying on emotions alone is not the way to go today, Leo. A Venus-Neptune opposition could find you thinking with your heart instead of your head. You need to get clear about certain situations, especially because Mercury is about to go retrograde in your sign on Thursday.

"
3809,25 july 2018,leo,"You might pull a 180 when it comes to your deepest dreams and desires, Leo. Erratic Uranus is active, stirring up your brain to come up with even better and more audacious plans. But not everyone may be on board with this, including you! Don’t let fear hold you back.

"
3810,26 july 2018,leo,"Is it time for Leo 2.0? The cosmos seems to think so. Yes, the fiery Sun is now in your sign, illuminating your most cherished desires. But Mercury retrogrades today in your sign, suggesting that you reconsider your alternatives. There’s nothing wrong with overhauling your plans.

"
3811,27 july 2018,leo,"Just how much independence do you need in your life, Leo? Right now it may be a lot. The issue at hand is that today’s lunar eclipse falls in your house of partnering. Someone may want to form deeper bonds with you, personally or professionally. Are you ready to take the plunge?

"
3812,28 july 2018,leo,"The Sun is in your sign, and naturally it’s your time to dream! No doubt you’re hatching some fabulous new plans for the year ahead. Today is an excellent time to get started on them, as Venus and Pluto meet up in two of the most practical parts of your chart. Coming up with strategies (and even the money) to make things happen becomes much easier.

"
3813,29 july 2018,leo,"Mercury may be retrograde in your sign, but that doesn’t mean that your thoughts are off target. The problem is that other people may think so. You can take this personally, or you could just laugh it off and keep doing what you were going to do anyhow!

"
3814,30 july 2018,leo,"It will be hard to hide your feelings today, thanks to a Moon-Jupiter connection. But this is a positive thing! There is nothing wrong with letting people know what you’re thinking. After all, the Sun is in your sign. It’s your birthday season and you should be asking for what you want.

"
3815,31 july 2018,leo,"Maintaining a steady cash flow is always important to the luxe loving lion. And today you may hit upon some awesome ideas for building up your income. From your chart, it appears that you may find a passive income opportunity that  could pay off nicely.

"
3816,1 august 2018,leo,"What you want and what somebody else wants are probably going to be two different things. You could let this turn into the mother of all arguments, or just agree to disagree. From your chart it looks like you’re going to do things your own way anyhow. So why bother getting into a lather about this?

"
3817,2 august 2018,leo,"It’s time to spruce up your lair, lion. With the moon and the most creative part of your chart, you should be thinking about ways to freshen up your place. Try to do this before the solar eclipse in your sign on the 11th. Things will really start popping after then, and you may not have the time for interior design.

"
3818,3 august 2018,leo,"You could be confused today about which direction to head in. It’s not surprising, really. With the Sun in your sign, you are uncovering plenty of options that are appealing to you. Don’t try to make a decision now. This energy is going to continue all the way through the eclipse on the 11th.

"
3819,4 august 2018,leo,"Brilliant Uranus is in your house of goals and career success for the first time in over 80 years. Today, it’s stirring up all sorts of ideas in your head. Scribble them down on a piece of paper. When Uranus retrogrades next Tuesday, that’s the time to start considering your options.

"
3820,5 august 2018,leo,"Things that are old and outdated need to go, Leo. With detective-like Pluto in your house of productivity, you need to get your act together. Once the solar eclipse arrives in your sign on Saturday the 11th, you’ll be way too busy to take care of these kinds of things.

"
3821,6 august 2018,leo,"Gotta love it! You are the celestial favorite with the Sun in your sign, and then today Venus glides into your house of socializing and self-expression. The next few weeks are awesome for getting your message out there, whatever that message may be. Meeting new people is also in the stars, and this includes a new love interest.

"
3822,7 august 2018,leo,"Uranus is the planet that helps you become recognized as a trailblazer, thanks to its ability to produce avant-garde ideas. Today it goes retrograde, but this is not something to be upset about. Over the next few months you could come up with some big ideas with serious long-term potential. Don’t dismiss them.

"
3823,8 august 2018,leo,"The summer Sun is sizzling north of the equator, and so is your love life! With the two cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, in a fabulous aspect romance heats up nicely. You are at your charismatic best!

"
3824,9 august 2018,leo,"You won’t be in the mood for fuzzy promises or unclear situations. Planets in the most practical parts of your chart are demanding answers. Successful long-term planning is critical right now. Saturday’s solar eclipse in your sign will open up many new doors; you need to know which ones to go through.

"
3825,10 august 2018,leo,"Are you ready? Tomorrow’s solar eclipse occurs in your sign, highlighting all of your biggest dreams. But make sure that you’re following your own path and not someone else’s. Others may try to get you to buy into their plan. Not happening!

"
3826,11 august 2018,leo,"Yeah, baby! A sparkling solar eclipse occurs in your sign. Ready for a personal makeover? Want to show off a brand-new attitude? Maybe you want to chase after some dreams that have been calling your name for years. Now is the time, and you can make an awful lot of progress by February 2019.

"
3827,12 august 2018,leo,"Yesterday a solar eclipse occurred in your sign. And naturally, you’re thinking about all sorts of juicy plans! But before you can launch anything, it’s imperative to get caught up on old chores and projects. This may not be what you want to hear, but Mars retrogrades today into your house of productivity. If you want to conquer the world, first you need to develop better habits and systems.

"
3828,13 august 2018,leo,"Things could be a little murky today in both love and your finances, Leo. That’s because foggy Neptune is swirling its mist in your house of wealth and intimacy. The good news is that tomorrow your mind will be as sharp as a tack. Wait until then to make decisions.

"
3829,14 august 2018,leo,"Considering that the recent solar eclipse fell in your sign, the world is now your oyster! You can go after any dream of your choosing. A Venus-Moon aspect today is perfect for meeting new people and socializing, and this includes finding new love. It’s also a great date night, one of the best all week.

"
3830,15 august 2018,leo,"Today you are going to have to balance mixing business with pleasure. Yes, the job has to get done. But from your chart it also looks like you need some downtime! It’s your birthday season, babe. Don’t forget to shake that mane and roar.

"
3831,16 august 2018,leo,"Someone may be unusually assertive with you today, and it might rattle your cage. But this is just a short lived drama. Let it go. By tomorrow, you’re feeling content and comfortable within your own skin.

"
3832,17 august 2018,leo,"You have a lot on your plate, so much that you maybe feeling a bit overwhelmed. But that’s because Mercury is retrograde in your sign. It stations direct on Sunday, so once that happens you’ll feel more confident. The planets recommend that you get your home organized today, as you won’t have much time for that soon.

"
3833,18 august 2018,leo,"Damn, you look good. And the words coming from your mouth to charm the birds from the trees. It’s pretty sweet to be a Leo today, thanks to chatty Mercury and magnetic Venus forming a fabulous aspect. And Mercury is retrograde, thank you very much. But it goes direct tomorrow, so things should only get better.

"
3834,19 august 2018,leo,"Your birthday season ain’t over yet, and you’re not going to let the Sun leave without a few fireworks! The good news is that high wattage Mercury goes direct today in your sign. All of the escapades you’ve been planning, the world domination, the makeover…it’s time to launch.  You’ve had time to strategize; now is the moment for action.

"
3835,20 august 2018,leo,"Ready to purr? With a generous Jupiter winking at amorous Neptune, this is a perfect time to let someone know how you feel. Things could get quite emo, but in a happy way.

"
3836,21 august 2018,leo,"You mean business, and I feel sorry for anyone who gets in your way! But chances are that won’t happen, so spend today getting organized and plan your next move. You may have to do some research first, and tomorrow’s energy is perfect for that.

"
3837,22 august 2018,leo,"You may need to step in and take charge of a situation that is going off the rails, whether you feel like it or not. The problem is, if you don’t, you’ll end up getting the short end of the stick. Let other people know that you mean business and you know how to get things done.

"
3838,23 august 2018,leo,"Okay, lion. Birthday time is officially over. The Sun is now in Virgo and it’s time for you to start making mo’ money. The next four weeks are some of the best in 2018 for ratcheting up your income. Over the next five days, you should be reviewing your habits: not only when it comes to spending and saving, but also how you get your job done. Is it time to start a side hustle or move to another place of employment?

"
3839,24 august 2018,leo,"If you’ve been slacking off, the party is over! Motivational Mars meets up with the Moon in the most productive part of your chart today. Whether you want to slim down and tone up, or get your house in order, the time is now. Once Mars goes direct on Monday you will be even more motivated to get things done.

"
3840,25 august 2018,leo,"You’ve been working hard and people have taken notice. Now that the Sun is in your house of making more money, you should be able to cash in on your efforts. Over the next two weeks something unexpected (but good!) could happen, so get ready to talk about raises and business deals.

"
3841,26 august 2018,leo,"Tonight the cosmos delivers the annual full moon in your house of intimacy and emotional depth. You should be more than ready to commit to loving someone, which means that a relationship can take flight. So can a budding romance. But don’t forget to take loving care of yourself too, which means doing some important inner work.

"
3842,27 august 2018,leo,"Over the past few weeks it may have become obvious to you that you desperately needed to get your sh** together. This isn’t so much about your mental state but getting caught up on mundane tasks and work projects. Now that Mars has gone direct in your house of organization and efficiency, you can start to feel as though your on top of things again—as long as you’re willing to do the grunt work necessary!

"
3843,28 august 2018,leo,"With intelligent, rational Mercury in your sign you are looking at the world through a clear lens. But other people may be tugging at you, trying to sway you to their way of thinking. Or maybe it’s a little voice in your own head that wants you to stick with the past, as uncomfortable as it may have been! Stick with the logical left side of your brain on this one.

"
3844,29 august 2018,leo,"Now that ambitious Mars is direct in your house of efficiency, you should be figuring out how to get things done in less time. You need more play time, period. Start by taking control of your schedule and not allowing other people to waste valuable hours (or even minutes!) of your life.

"
3845,30 august 2018,leo,"Things may not go according to plan today, so leave early, back up your files and be prepared for people switching their plans. Mercury isn’t retrograde but things could still get screwed up!

"
3846,31 august 2018,leo,"There could be an unexpected turn in career matters, something that speeds up your plans. You’ve got everything going for you right now: the Sun in your house of income, energetic Mars in your efficiency sector, shrewd Mercury in Leo, and revolutionary Uranus in your house of ambition. Don’t waste this energy!

"
3847,1 september 2018,leo,"With intelligent Mercury in your sign, your brain should be popping with ideas. That’s the good news. The bad news is that you are either (a) spreading yourself too thin or (b) chasing after people or situations that don’t reflect your core values. Be selective.

"
3848,2 september 2018,leo,"Your values may be changing, Leo, and this is a good thing. Settling for life’s table scraps has never suited a regal person like yourself. Don’t be afraid to expect more….and then get it.

"
3849,3 september 2018,leo,"The time has come to commit, Leo. It’s time to start doing all of the things you’ve been promising to do: lose weight, save more money, stop thinking negatively, whatever. It may seem daunting but the end result will put a huge smile on your face. Stop procrastinating and begin.

"
3850,4 september 2018,leo,"This is no time to be a maverick at the office, Leo. Slap a smile on your face and play by the rules. Your career is about to take off and you’ll have more say-so when it comes to your working conditions, so suck it up for now.

"
3851,5 september 2018,leo,"Show me the money! If you’re looking to earn more (who isn’t?) then you’re in luck. Shrewd Mercury is now in your earnings sector, helping you land more cash. And tomorrow Saturn goes direct in your productivity sector, turning you into an efficiency machine. Nothing is going to stop you.

"
3852,6 september 2018,leo,"Life is about to become saner and more organized. Logical Saturn has been retrograde for the past few months in your house of efficiency, encouraging you to create better habits. Hopefully you have. Now it’s time to reap the rewards: less stress, a more serene environment and even better health and fitness.

"
3853,7 september 2018,leo,"This is one of the best days all month… or maybe all year!…to make headway with your income and career. In astrology, there are three houses that govern your occupation and success. Planets are lining up in all three, in a beautiful way. Don’t be afraid to do something a little unexpected. Things could work out better than you might imagine.

"
3854,8 september 2018,leo,"All talk no action? If that describes you, things need to change. Energetic Mars is in your house of efficiency, determined to get things done. It’s time to stop dreaming and talking about things. As the saying goes, “Just do it.”

"
3855,9 september 2018,leo,"It’s time that you start to build a more stable base, Leo—both financially and emotionally. Fortunately today’s new moon occurs in your house of earning more income. And gentle Venus glides into your house of contentment and feeling at ease. If you need to do some inner work to release negativity, you are in a fabulous place to stick to new habits, like meditation or journaling.

"
3856,10 september 2018,leo,"If you’re ready to lock in a serious romance, the cosmos is ready for you. High-octane Mars moves into your house of commitment today. Sometimes this aspect can create arguments and jealousy. But other planets are in a peace loving mood, demanding stability and maturity. This means that both you and  a lover need to act like grownups.

"
3857,11 september 2018,leo,"You may be concerned about your cash situation, but today’s aspects are terrific for solidifying your foundation. Are you willing first to examine your habits about spending and saving? With deep diving Pluto in your house of routines, you should be taking an honest look. Then start considering how you can earn more. Tomorrow could bring a brilliant idea, thanks to genius Uranus.

"
3858,12 september 2018,leo,"What counts most these days is inner peace. Feeling healthy and physically vibrant is important too. Do what it takes to get your body and mind in alignment. If this means ignoring the outside world to a certain extent, so be it.

"
3859,13 september 2018,leo,"Emotions could be a bit raw today, either on your part or the part of people in your environment. And people may not be exactly forthright either. As a result, you’d be wise to avoid known perpetrators, or anyone who seems to be talking in circles. Let your own intelligence and intuition be your guide.

"
3860,14 september 2018,leo,"It seems like everyone is in a snit today and that you can’t keep anyone happy. Don’t let this interrupt the flow of your precious chi. Right now you need to remain focused. If that means just worrying about yourself, so be it!

"
3861,15 september 2018,leo,"Why do we habitually do the things that we do? Our subconscious mind gets stuck in a groove, and it can be difficult to get out of them sometimes. But not today, not for you. Break out of old routines and embrace new ones. You’re in a highly productive phase right now. Make the changes, because later this month you’ll be more interested in just having fun!

"
3862,16 september 2018,leo,"If you want to start putting aside some money for your home, now is a good time to start. This could be the down payment on a house or just a few bucks for a new duvet. This is one of the best years in over a decade to feather your nest, but that always costs money! Figure out how to build your income or cut expenses.

"
3863,17 september 2018,leo,"You’re getting a lot more serious about creating better habits, and the good news is that they’re going to pay off. “Discipline” is an uncomfortable word for a lot of people. The reality is that it sets you free. Less stress, better health, more money in the bank, a fitter body….who doesn’t want that?

"
3864,18 september 2018,leo,"This is not a good day to mouth off to someone, Leo, especially if they wield any influence. You maybe sick and tired of being a team player, but still you need to play the game for little while longer. The full moon arriving on the 24th is a wonderful opportunity for you to start doing things your way.

"
3865,19 september 2018,leo,"The Sun will be leaving your house of income and savings within the next few days. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t make progress. As a matter fact, today is wonderful for putting the finishing touches on ideas that will increase your cash flow. Once the Sun moves into Libra this weekend, it’s time to start promoting your ideas.

"
3866,20 september 2018,leo,"It’s time to recharge your batteries, Leo. No, really. Anyone who thinks that you are a languid lion has not been paying attention to how much work you’ve been doing lately. The Sun is ready to enter the most social part of your chart. You deserve some fun, so rest up now.

"
3867,21 september 2018,leo,"The speed of life is going to start to pick up over the next four weeks, Leo. You could be busy zipping around the neighborhood getting errands done. Networking with people will be important too, whether it’s for fun or business. Your vitality looks like it might be a little low according to your chart, so rest up now.

"
3868,22 september 2018,leo,"Rules? What rules? Now that the Sun is in the most social part of your chart, you may just feel like having fun. And there’s nothing wrong with that, as long as you remember that you have to get some work done. Go ahead: flirt, go out for drinks with your friends, network with colleagues, and go away on some short trips. But you can also schmooze for business purposes too.

"
3869,23 september 2018,leo,"You need to start walking the walk and talking the talk, Leo. This goes for diets and exercise programs. It includes the way you talk to people and the way you think. Staying on top of projects, both at home and at work, is super important. Stop procrastinating and get things done already.
 

"
3870,24 september 2018,leo,"If there is any sign of the zodiac that is ready to bust out of limiting conditions, it’s you. Tonight’s full moon is just the ticket for doing so! The problem is, you may be focusing on so many little details that you can’t see the big picture. Or you’re so hard at work that you don’t believe that you’ll ever move on. You can, and you will.

"
3871,25 september 2018,leo,"People could really be stuck in “group think” mode today. And if you try to offer your opinion or bright ideas, they could get shot down. Not to worry. They need you a lot more than you need them. Push forward with your own agenda!

"
3872,26 september 2018,leo,"You should be feeling more lighthearted and comfortable in your skin, Leo. The Moon is currently in the most optimistic part of your chart, encouraging you to let go of emotional baggage. It’s time to chase after some new dreams without anything holding you back.

"
3873,27 september 2018,leo,"This is a wonderful day for developing stronger relationships with others, Leo. It’s also a good time for meeting new people, the kind of people who can be in your life for years to come. But nothing’s going to happen if you’re hiding out in your lair. Make the effort!

"
3874,28 september 2018,leo,"Anyone who thinks that you are not up to a particular task is in for a big surprise. This includes you, Leo! Don’t let fears or low self-esteem get in your way. Once you get going, you may realize that things are far easier than you expected.

"
3875,30 september 2018,leo,"We all need to assess our values from time to time. With the Moon in the part of your chart that deals with your most cherished dreams, you should be considering what’s most important to you—now. Quit being sentimental about old plans or goals. Change is in the air, and it’s for the better.

"
3876,1 october 2018,leo,"Be careful what you say and do, Leo. The moon is in the moodiest part of your chart, stirring up all sorts of thoughts. The smartest thing that you can do right now is to put a smile on your face and play the game, something that doesn’t sit well with your proud sign! But you do understand stealth, and that’s the way you need to act right now–quiet and deadly!

"
3877,2 october 2018,leo,"When playing high-stakes poker, you need to keep your cards close to your vest. And the term “poker face” is around for a reason. Today, say little…observe a lot…and give nothing away. Be inscrutable. Knowledge is power.

"
3878,3 october 2018,leo,"Heavens, do you need a break. From your chart it looks like you have one nerve left and everyone is working it. Today is perfect for some extreme self-care so don’t feel guilty about pampering yourself. Or maybe you just need to do a little bit of meditation and inner work. Do whatever it takes.

"
3879,4 october 2018,leo,"Your fearless sign is not known for hiding its emotions or game plan. Why bother? After all, you’re the fiercest predator in the cosmos. But a tense Moon-Uranus suggests that you play it coy today. So pull back the claws and act like a cute little fuzzy bunny rabbit. Don’t worry, you can go back to your usual self soon.

"
3880,5 october 2018,leo,"You’re always so proud and fierce that many people don’t realize that even Leos can suffer from a lack of confidence. And that’s exactly what might happen between now and Halloween, thanks to Venus going retro in moody Scorpio. Quit being so emo. Royalty knows how to rise above petty crap. (Just look at how Meghan Markle deals with her crazy ass sister.)

"
3881,6 october 2018,leo,"Dream houses, designer clothes, trips around the world, a big juicy retirement account—where the hell are they? That’s what you may be thinking today as you ogle the goodies that others have. When is it going to be your turn? Sooner than you may think. But this isn’t going to come from a winning lottery ticket; it’s all about the hustle.

"
3882,7 october 2018,leo,"You’re a Leo, and you deserve the best. That’s understood! So why are you settling for less? Come on, get your act together. It’s time to own  that regal lion persona.

"
3883,8 october 2018,leo,"The new Moon in Libra is the perfect time for you to express yourself, Leo. Brainstorm with other people. Plan a social media blitz. Flirt like crazy. Revamp your brand. There is one warning, however: don’t challenge authority too much. You’ll be able to get your way, but only if you play it cool.

"
3884,9 october 2018,leo,"Your ability to communicate with others will skyrocket now that Mercury is in Scorpio. Creating more cooperative relationships with people, both in your personal and professional life, is possible. You may not feel this on Wednesday and Friday of this week, but you’ll be able to make progress before the month is out.

"
3885,10 october 2018,leo,"People could be critical today. They could be forceful, erratic. It will be easy to lash out in anger, taking a nip at them with those teeth of yours. Don’t go there, no matter how tempting it is. Maintaining calm and balanced is far more important.

"
3886,11 october 2018,leo,"Try to get ahead of tasks and projects: your sanity depends on it. This includes your home life as well as work. A positive Moon-Pluto aspect is helpful for creating a home office or a business you can run on the side.

"
3887,12 october 2018,leo,"You know what you need to do. You have your day all planned out. You have an end goal in mind. All the more reason to not let others throw you off track with their incessant demands. Politely avoid them and do your own thing.

"
3888,13 october 2018,leo,"Your moods have been thrown all over the place recently by people playing games and events that are out of your control. But once the Moon enters steady, calm Capricorn tomorrow, your mind will settle down. One of the best things to do at times like this is to stick to old routines and habits. They will provide comfort.

"
3889,14 october 2018,leo,"OK Leo, are you ready to get serious? I’m referring to sticking to your plans and habits. Right now you’re having a New-Year’s-Day-in-October kind of a situation going on. Wise, mature Saturn is kicking you in the butt, encouraging you to develop some discipline. You’ll be glad later on that you did.

"
3890,15 october 2018,leo,"Awwww!! Today’s looking sentimental and mushy due to a Venus-Mercury aspect. Take a break to enjoy some quality time with a loved one (which includes you!), as the next few days are demanding that you bang out work and errands.

"
3891,16 october 2018,leo,"You really need to find a better way to deal with co-workers and your tasks, Leo. If you don’t you’ll end up running yourself ragged. Once the Sun enters Scorpio next week, your need for serenity will grow even stronger. But just chanting a mantra isn’t going to do it!

"
3892,17 october 2018,leo,"If you need to patch things up with someone, the next three days are a good time to do so. That said, don’t let anyone guilt you into doing something that you’re not thrilled about. It’s one thing to keep the peace, and another to sell your soul.

"
3893,18 october 2018,leo,"From your chart it appears that you’ve been spreading yourself too thin, especially when it comes to meeting the demands of others. If too many people are pulling on you, you may need to make a choice about whom you’re going to help. Besides, some of these people can take care of their own problems.

"
3894,19 october 2018,leo,"It’s imperative that you are clear about money matters. There could be some enticing investments or job opportunities in front of you. But before you dive in, do your homework. This is especially true if you are going to have a partner or spouse involved in a fiscal decision.

"
3895,20 october 2018,leo,"Love and money. The two areas of life that most people care about the most. You will be thinking about them today, thanks to inspirational Neptune active in a house that governs both. Today is a day to dream rather than think about the nuts and bolts of situations. Save the reality checks for the time of next Wednesday’s full moon.

"
3896,21 october 2018,leo,"It’s a wonderful day to feel comfortable in your own skin! What this means is that you don’t have to be troubled by the opinions of others. Nor should you worry about the dramas that they insist on creating. Go your own way, Leo.

"
3897,22 october 2018,leo,"Over the next four weeks, you can settle into a comfortable new groove. You have some big decisions to make about the direction your life is heading in, and the full moon on Wednesday is the best time to do so. After that, peace will be yours. You’ll be on the right track.

"
3898,23 october 2018,leo,"You are SO fed up with drama and chaos. And now that the fiery Sun, your ruler, is in your house of quiet contentment, you will become determined to find peace. If your job or line or work is less than fulfilling, that may be the best place to start right now.

"
3899,24 october 2018,leo,"Tonight brings your annual full moon in the goals sector. Let’s put it this way, Leo: if you have things that you’d like to accomplish by year’s end, start hustling. And if you’re not happy with certain aspects of your life, it’s time for some serious inner reflection. It’s important that you are at peace with your decisions.

"
3900,25 october 2018,leo,"Try your best to get ahead with your work at the office. And while you’re at it, do the same with that to-do list at home. The cosmos is pushing you to wrap things up so that you’ll start to feel more serene. The longer the to-do list, the more stressed you’ll be.

"
3901,26 october 2018,leo,"The weekend is almost here and the cosmos is telling you to focus on your home environment. If your lair is looking a wee bit….shabby, then it’s time for a little makeover. Clean up the clutter, get some fresh air in the place, and go shopping for gorgeous new stuff.

"
3902,27 october 2018,leo,"This past year has been full of very “settling” energy. Leos have been encouraged to create a happy home environment, and security in their jobs. But things are starting to loosen up. It’s time to start living la vida loca–are you ready?

"
3903,28 october 2018,leo,"Recharge your batteries today, Leo. With healing Jupiter and gentle Venus in your domestic sector, this would be a good time to relax at home. If you decide to go out with friends, keep things low key. Once Mercury changes signs on Wednesday, you’ll be ready to paint the town red.

"
3904,29 october 2018,leo,"Be sure to show your loved ones just how much you care. A lovely meeting between verbal Mercury and healing Jupiter is setting the stage for creating more peace and love. While you’re at it, make sure that you take very good care of yourself!

"
3905,30 october 2018,leo,"Buddha said that we become what we think about. Keep that in mind as you go through your day. The trolls and malcontents may be out there, but you can’t let them ruin your state of mind. Treat your mind as though it is a holy temple, something that will not be defiled.

"
3906,31 october 2018,leo,"Planetary activity today will send your emotions into a tizzy. And the problem is that Venus starts to retrograde in your communication sector. As a result, you run the risk of saying something you shouldn’t. Let this tempest in a teapot pass, which should take a few days.

"
3907,1 november 2018,leo,"Planetary activity in the most sensitive part of your chart is making you focus on peace of mind. Seriously, you have to get to the bottom of what’s bothering you. Is it truly worth being upset about? If not, make peace with it and move on.

"
3908,2 november 2018,leo,"People could be playing on your emotions, so pay attention to what they’re saying and doing. Fortunately the Moon is in the most practical part of your chart, and you should be able to see through this nonsense. Wait until early next week before saying or doing anything.

"
3909,4 november 2018,leo,"It’s time to be carefree and playful, Leo. Over the past few weeks life may have seemed like a grind. You deserve to be happy. And when generous Jupiter enters your house fun and romance on Thursday, there is even more joy on the horizon.

"
3910,5 november 2018,leo,"Sometimes when planets move on from a sign, they leave a gift in our laps. Jupiter is getting ready to glide into Sagittarius on Thursday. It spends three more days in your house of contentment and security. One of the gifts it may give you is peace of mind, if you are willing to receive it.

"
3911,6 november 2018,leo,"Don’t be surprised if you decide to take a step back and rework some of your plans, Leo. That’s because brilliant Uranus retrogrades into your house of taking risks. This is actually a valuable aspect, as you could uncover new ways of doing things. Naturally things will be delayed, but the end result will be so wonderful you’ll be happy that you took the time to consider your options.

"
3912,7 november 2018,leo,"Mighty Jupiter will be leaving your house of home, family and inner peace tomorrow. But a sparkling new moon today in this sector grants you another six months of help. Pluto is active in your house of organization, urging you to catch up on old tasks and declutter. A decluttered house will lead to a more serene mind.

"
3913,8 november 2018,leo,"Oh, yeah! All of you lions out there should be happier than a pig in mud. Generous Jupiter glides into your house of creativity, fun and romance. The gas giant has not been in this part of your charts in over a decade. Your talents can soar through the roof. New love can enter your life, or you could conceive a baby. Hitting the town and enjoying culture will become more important you than ever before. Cheers!

"
3914,9 november 2018,leo,"There are times when you need to speak up and this is one of them. The good news is that gentle Venus is in your house of communication. You should be able to speak your piece without ruffling anyone’s feathers. Serious talks with a lover are well aspected today, FYI.

"
3915,10 november 2018,leo,"Everyone thinks that Leos are larger than life characters. And in truth, maybe they are! But you know deep down that sometimes you just don’t feel so fabulous. That’s okay. Over the next 13 months, your going to get your mojo back.

"
3916,11 november 2018,leo,"You’ve been pushing hard lately, way too hard. A healing Sun-Pluto aspect recommends that you recharge your batteries. Life can’t be all about work and responsibility. Be good to yourself.

"
3917,12 november 2018,leo,"You need to change the way you get things done, Leo. Even if you think that you are quite efficient, there is always room for improvement. Besides, the more effort you put into it this, the faster you’ll feel relieved…..and less stressed.

"
3918,13 november 2018,leo,"This is a great day to make sure that you’re on the same page with other people, both at work and in your personal life. The cosmic lines of communication are wide open. But once Mercury goes retrograde on Friday, there could be—as they say in Hollywood— “creative differences.”

"
3919,15 november 2018,leo,"Got the fire down below?! Now that Mars is in the sexiest part of your chart, you could be ready to steam things up in the boudoir. But the problem is that Mercury goes retrograde tomorrow in your house of romance. This means that you could be blinded by your libido, not paying attention to what’s really going on in a relationship. Remain aware.

"
3920,16 november 2018,leo,"Lucky Jupiter entered your house of romance, fun and creativity back on the 8th. This is big news, because Jupiter has not been in this part of your chart in over a decade. But before you dive into new adventures, slow down and consider your options. Mercury goes retrograde today in the same sector. Spend some time thinking about what you’d really like to manifest in the year ahead.

"
3921,17 november 2018,leo,"Your ability to get your point across skyrockets now that Venus is direct in your house of communication. You won’t have to beat anybody over the head either! Just put it out there. Your personal magnetism is also increasing, something that people will notice.

"
3922,18 november 2018,leo,"You know what has to be done. So what are you waiting for? The perfect conditions to come along? Let’s face it, situations will never be absolutely perfect. The most important thing is that you get started.

"
3923,19 november 2018,leo,"Not everyone shares your sunny attitude towards life! So if you happen to be in the presence of someone who wants to burst your bubble, pull away. You don’t need their negative mojo bringing you down.

"
3924,21 november 2018,leo,"You’ve never given a rat’s ass if people like you, or if you fit in. That’s what makes you so fierce… and fun! Today is a perfect day to go loud and proud. Who cares if you offend someone; maybe they need to wake up.

"
3925,22 november 2018,leo,"You’ve probably heard this phrase: “You become like the five people you hang around with the most.” A pretty sobering thought, no? Well, tonight’s full moon in your house of friends and networking shines its light on your closest connections. Choose your friends and colleagues wisely.

"
3926,23 november 2018,leo,"You may be feeling like a steam pipe that is about to burst. Emotions and ideas are building up inside you….but whom should you discuss them with? Pick your confidantes wisely, Leo.

"
3927,24 november 2018,leo,"If your love life or financial situation has been on hold, you can blame it on Neptune being retrograde. It was spinning backward in your house of net worth and intimacy, but fortunately that ends today. Get ready for forward monement, at least on your part. Others may not be as quick to get going!

"
3928,27 november 2018,leo,"The energy from yesterday’s magnificent Jupiter-Sun aspect is still in play. Actually, it intensifies because magnetic Mercury joins them. This is an incredible time to speak your mind and demonstrate your creativity. It’s also perfect for flirting or telling someone how much you love them. The next twelve months are some of the best ever for experiencing joy and savoring life.

"
3929,28 november 2018,leo,"There has been an awful lot of planetary activity over the last few days encouraging you to have fun. Which is fine…but you still have to get the grunt work accomplished! Today is a powerful time to develop some good habits and routines. These are the kind that can put money in your pocket, by the way.

"
3930,29 november 2018,leo,"Taking a calculated risk could actually pay off thanks to a Moon-Uranus aspect. Therefore, don’t dismiss what seem to be crazy ideas, or listen to people who tell you that “it can’t be done.” Spend the month of December thinking about grand plans, because once Mars enters this part of your chart on December 31st, it’s all systems go.

"
3931,30 november 2018,leo,"A powerful voice inside your head it telling you to go for it. Then a little wimpy one is shrieking, “I’m afraid!” I’ve got news for you, Leo. The stronger voice is going to win this battle. So stop waffling and take that leap. Besides, since when does the word “wimp” ever apply to a Leo?

"
3932,1 december 2018,leo,"Feeling good in your own skin is important to you, any anything or anyone who messes should be under scrutiny. Mercury retrogrades today in your house of emotional stability. This is a short retro period–it’s over by the 6th–but you should use it to figure out just what you need to feel more chill. Even a languid lion can get stressed, after all.

"
3933,2 december 2018,leo,"If you want something badly enough in your life, you will make it happen. The Sun is in your house of creativity and talent. Brilliant Uranus is active in your house of big picture thinking. Just don’t expect overnight success.

"
3934,3 december 2018,leo,"A laid-back approach will get you much further than coming on strong, Leo. Yes, we know. You love to growl and roar. But today is not the time for displays of power or emotion. Play it cool.

"
3935,4 december 2018,leo,"The cosmos wants you to develop more inner peace, lion. Today you might be quite introspective, reflecting about the issues and emotions that may be troubling you. The good news is that you have the mental tools for working on yourself. What are you waiting for?

"
3936,5 december 2018,leo,"Your sign is famous for drama. Heck, many singers and actors are Leos. But today’s not the time for outward displays of emotion. Hissy fits, angry eruptions, poor little me routines—shelve ‘em. And if other people are acting this way, let them know that you don’t want to partake.

"
3937,6 december 2018,leo,"Matters at home should quiet down now that Mercury is direct in your domestic sector. It’s smart to put these things behind you, because tomorrow’s new Moon occurs in your house of romance. You’re going to have far sweeter things to think about!

"
3938,7 december 2018,leo,"A brand-new chapter in life can open up, if  you are willing to let go of some less-than-helpful emotions. The problem is that Mars and Neptune both square the new moon from the most sensitive part of your chart. You need to let go of jealousy, old dramas and resentment if you desire progress.

"
3939,8 december 2018,leo,"Are you ready to let your talents really shine? A new moon yesterday occurred in your house of creativity. The power of a new moon is the most potent in the two weeks that follow it. You can focus on the skills you bring to the workplace or the fun you can have just puttering around with oil paints, for example, as a hobby. Mercury enters this house on Wednesday, so now’s the time to dive in.

"
3940,9 december 2018,leo,"Your personal happiness is becoming a bigger priority to you. And so it should be. It’s one thing to worry and care about other people, and another to lose yourself in the process. Take care of yourself, Leo.

"
3941,10 december 2018,leo,"If you want to be successful at something, it may be wise to model somebody else whom you admire. Why reinvent the wheel? This way you can make progress without doing anything too risky.

"
3942,11 december 2018,leo,"People could be tossing around their attitudes and opinions, but you don’t have to pay attention to them! You know where you’re coming from and are content with your own ideas. Let others go loud and proud. You don’t need to join them.

"
3943,12 december 2018,leo,"It’s no secret—your sign is the most creative of the zodiac! And the planets are lining up in an amazing way to help you tap into your talents. There was a new moon in this sector a few days ago and today Mercury enters it. The next twelve months can be game changers; are you ready?

"
3944,13 december 2018,leo,"You may be tempted to cut corners today, but it wouldn’t be wise. Yes, you’re a creative genius–all Leos are! And yes, you have some super ideas. But don’t let emotions run this show. Logic is needed instead.

"
3945,14 december 2018,leo,"Yikes. From your chart it looks like you could  be an emotional mess today. But you don’t have to be. Channel your energy into healing instead. With motivated Mars in one of the most psychological parts of your chart, it’s possible to get rid of some of the mental junk.

"
3946,15 december 2018,leo,"Aahhhh. A lovely lunar aspect soothes your tired mind and soul. Your sign has been going through a lot emotionally as of late, and chances are you’re weary. But naturally, you’re too proud to show it. Go off to your lair, lick your wounds and re-emerge as your usual fierce self.

"
3947,16 december 2018,leo,"Today is a good time to beautify your home. If you’re tripping over piles of unwashed clothes, toys or unread newspapers, it’s time to get organized. Likewise, your place should be gorgeous, not so-so. Start planning new purchases now and then wait for everything to go on sale after Christmas.  You need a lush lair, baby.

"
3948,17 december 2018,leo,"You will be coming to some fast decisions over the next week, and the good thing is that you’re in a terrific spot to do so. The two most assertive planets in the solar system, Mars and Pluto, are teaming up in your houses of logic and emotion. Both your head and your heart will be working together, rather than against each other!

"
3949,18 december 2018,leo,"You have some mixed vibes going on. On the one hand, you may feel like pulling away from the madding crowd, nursing your wounds and dealing with your emotions. On the other hand, planets are pushing you to be bold and break the rules. Can you do both? Of course you can. You’re a Leo.

"
3950,19 december 2018,leo,"Your creativity is soaring and even you could be surprised by it. Sure, the planets are lining up to help you express yourself to the fullest. But the planets can’t do everything! Take credit for the hard work you’ve put in.

"
3951,20 december 2018,leo,"You’re famous for being the most creative sign of the zodiac, but even you can benefit from some inspiration. There will be plenty of that today, my friend! A terrific Sun-Uranus aspect will allow inspiration to hit you like a 10-ton truck. Have your sketchbook ready, or whatever you use to record your ideas. This Saturday’s full moon is the perfect time for working on them.

"
3952,21 december 2018,leo,"The cosmos is getting ready to give you a swift kick in the ass! No, this isn’t a takedown where you end up eating humble pie. This is more about a wakeup call, telling you to pull your act together and get moving. The Sun is now in Capricorn, your sixth house of productivity. You’re going to turn into a cyclone of efficient activity.

"
3953,22 december 2018,leo,"Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey hey, goodbye! Yeah, that’s your theme song these days thanks to tonight’s full moon in Cancer. It’s time to close out the past and move on, as Cancer is your twelfth house of closure and transition. No need to wait until New Year’s Day. Do it now.

"
3954,23 december 2018,leo,"You can try to forget things, or you can deal with them instead. This doesn’t mean that you have to spend weeks or months ruminating over old issues. Process them and let them go.

"
3955,24 december 2018,leo,"Don’t be so emo! A Mercury-Neptune square could bring out tension that has been building up inside of you. Fortunately this passes very quickly, by tomorrow in fact. Avoid people who are known button pushers and whiners and you’ll be OK.

"
3956,25 december 2018,leo,"Woo-hoo! It’s Christmas and the moon is in Leo. Neptune is a good angle from your house of intimacy, making for a romantic day. But it also could be cathartic, as you realize that negative emotions don’t have to plague you. Over the next five days you will be doing a lot of deep thinking about releasing old baggage.

"
3957,26 december 2018,leo,"Oh, the places you’ll go! Of course, this is the title of a book written by Dr. Seuss. But it’s also the cosmos’ message for you today. Sparkling Uranus is firing you up to live bigger and bolder than ever. And we all know that a lion never backs away from a challenge.

"
3958,27 december 2018,leo,"You’re not afraid of hard work, which is a good thing. You’re getting ready to dive into a project that has fabulous long-term consequences. It could cost time, money and effort right now, but in the long run you’ll be happy that you did it.

"
3959,28 december 2018,leo,"Today’s aspects are perfect for beautifying your home environment. Pluto, planet of transformation, is active, telling you to clean out closets and junk drawers. At the same time glamorous Venus is stirring things up in your domestic sector. Hit the sales and buy some things to make your place more posh.

"
3960,29 december 2018,leo,"You’ve been getting riled up about a lot of things lately. It doesn’t seem as though you’re overreacting; you truly do have things to be annoyed about. But is it worth it? A lunar aspect makes you question the cost of entertaining negative thoughts. It simply may not be worth it.

"
3961,30 december 2018,leo,"If you’ve been playing it too safe lately, the cosmos is going to give you a wake-up call. Our self image can be one of the most limiting factors that we deal with. Many people assume that it’s our circumstances that hold us back. But in actuality, it could be the limits within our minds.

"
3962,31 december 2018,leo,"Out with the old, in with the new… and ultra exciting! If 2018 wasn’t exactly the most scintillating year for you, put on your seatbelt. Things are about to get a heck of a lot more interesting. That’s because red hot Mars enters your house of adventure today, a place it hasn’t been for some time. 2019 will be all about taking risks, the smart kind.

"
3963,22 january 2018,virgo,"
If your home isn’t your castle, it should be. A dreamy Venus-Jupiter aspect today suggests that you turn your place into a perfect haven. Naturally, this involves some decorating, but it also includes settling dramas that may be going on with other people.

"
3964,8 march 2018,virgo,"Is it time to go back to school or get more job training? Jupiter is moving retrograde in your house of thinking, writing and self-expression. Those Virgos who are already attending school may switch majors or decide to take a different approach. Also consider how you speak to others—and how you talk to yourself! Be kinder and treat yourself well.

"
3965,9 march 2018,virgo,"Issues at home or within your family may need to be addressed, and today is a smart time to do so. Energetic Mars is in your domestic sector for the first time in two years and will be leaving on the 17th. Take care of things now, anything from home repairs to relationships.

"
3966,10 march 2018,virgo,"Arguments about intimacy, commitment and money could arise between now and Wednesday, Virgo, so take a deep breath and count to ten. Someone may try to push you into overspending or investing in something that’s questionable. Or, you may be on an emotional spending spree. Don’t go there!

"
3967,11 march 2018,virgo,"Your head and your heart could be at odds today, so (a) don’t get frustrated and (b) avoid making big decisions! The good news is that the planetary energy shifts for the better tomorrow. Wait until then.

"
3968,12 march 2018,virgo,"There may be times this week when you’ll have to read carefully between the lines to figure out what people are really thinking. Your intuition is stronger than you may suspect, so use it to your advantage.

"
3969,13 march 2018,virgo,"Over the next few days you’ll need to read between the lines in order to figure out what people are saying and thinking. It’s not that they’re trying to deceive you. But your emotions may be getting in the way, overriding logical thought. All the more reason to probe before you mouth off.

"
3970,14 march 2018,virgo,"Keep your opinions to yourself today, especially around the office. You may have the best intentions and your ideas could be right on track, but others may oppose where you’re coming from. The aggravation isn’t worth it!

"
3971,15 march 2018,virgo,"Saturday’s upcoming new moon occurs in your house of serious love, and it’s a honey. You might start feeling the energy today. It’s a good time to think about what it is that you truly want from a love relationship. Create that short list!

"
3972,16 march 2018,virgo,"Got the urge to merge? A Moon-Neptune meet-up in your house of bonding could lead to an interesting romantic or business partnership. Tomorrow’s new moon will be in this part of the sky, and it’s a honey for romance as well as creative business alliances.

"
3973,17 march 2018,virgo,"Yeah, baby! Your sign is the recipient of one heck of a gift from the cosmos: two planetary aspects in both of the houses that govern love. Lusty and energetic Mars enters your fifth house of romance, the place where we find new love or have more fun in an existing relationship. And a new moon occurs in your commitment sector, the place where we deepen our love and promises to each other. Yum.

"
3974,18 march 2018,virgo,"Preparing for your financial future is the order of the day. Maybe you view the future as some kind of far off time that is light years away. It’s actually closer than you might think, so start making preparations now.

"
3975,19 march 2018,virgo,"They say that talk is cheap, but that’s not the case with you today, Virgo. Your words carry weight so use them wisely. Fortunately gentle Venus is in a good angle, helping you soften your message.

"
3976,20 march 2018,virgo,"The Sun is in the sexiest, most sultry part of your chart, so I hope you’re well rested! The next four weeks could be quite passionate, but you’ll have to watch the tendency for becoming jealous or dramatic.

"
3977,21 march 2018,virgo,"Mind your money over the next few weeks, Virgo. Be ultra careful if purchasing items online, check your credit card statements and don’t go overboard with spending. It’s also a smart idea to review your financial statements, such as IRAs or mutual fund accounts. Mercury goes retro tomorrow in this area!

"
3978,22 march 2018,virgo,"Your sign is famous for being attentive to details, and that’s a quality you’re going to need over the next three weeks. Mercury begins to backstroke in your house of financial dealings. It’s imperative to know where your money is, how it’s being spent and how well your investments are doing. Protect your identity. Hold off on entering into contracts or joint ventures (if you can) through April 15th.

"
3979,23 march 2018,virgo,"A battle of wills could erupt, especially with a lover or a child over the next few days. Get ready for some Oscar-worthy dramatic performances! But all you need to do is to stay calm, cool and collected. Getting pulled in to a debate or hissy fit is not in your best interests right now.

"
3980,24 march 2018,virgo,"Staying calm and balanced within is a state that many people aspire to. The Sun is trying to shine its beneficial light on the dark recesses of your mind, but your ego wants to keep the drama going. Which celestial orb will win this battle? It depends on you. What is more important–serenity or chaos?

"
3981,25 march 2018,virgo,"You should be in quite a social mood due to a happy Moon-Jupiter aspect. The planets are telling you to get out there and have some fun with the tribe. If you can, plan a quick trip out of town in the near future too.

"
3982,26 march 2018,virgo,"Your ideas are changing, Virgo. And these changes will have a ripple effect which will transform your emotions (for the better, I might add). But right now the ride may be a bumpy one as you process things and do the inner work. Patience, my friend.

"
3983,27 march 2018,virgo,"It’s time to tap into your subconscious mind and rely on its wisdom more often. While you’re at it, you may want to start some good habits, like meditating, journaling and mindfulness. This week’s full moon is all about creating more stability in your life. Why not start with your mind and emotions?

"
3984,28 march 2018,virgo,"Who says that Virgos are as pure as the driven snow? Today’s a good time to get down and maybe a little, uh, dirty. A saucy meet-up between spontaneous Uranus and romantic Venus is perfect for flirting and canoodling! Enjoy.

"
3985,29 march 2018,virgo,"Personal relationships could have a back-and-forth feel as the Sun squares Saturn. Do you dive in or pull away? Push for an answer or wait awhile? Compromise or hold your ground? Reflect, but don’t make any key decisions now.

"
3986,30 march 2018,virgo,"Holding on to the past could prevent you from moving forward, Virgo, especially when it comes to close relationships. The new moon back on the 17th opened up doors. There are fresh opportunities for you to enjoy the company of other people. But nothing will happen if you remain stuck in the past.

"
3987,31 march 2018,virgo,"Some kind of a financial deal could come to a happy conclusion over the next two weeks, thanks to the full moon in your income sector. This could mean a raise, new job, landing a big client or starting a side business. There is a strong creative vibe at play, telling you to dazzle others with your talent, and to do whatever it takes to develop your skill set.

"
3988,1 april 2018,virgo,"Having clarity is a beautiful thing, especially when it comes to your emotions. A brilliant Sun-Mercury meeting helps you to get to the bottom of personal issues that may have been troubling you. The smartest thing you can do is to identify the people or situations that set you off–then avoid them.

"
3989,2 april 2018,virgo,"You could be feeling mighty impatient about love, demanding to know what’s going to happen next. But the harder you push the more frustrated you’ll become. Slow down before you alienate others too.

"
3990,3 april 2018,virgo,"It’s time to make a big change–you know it deep inside your heart and in your head. There’s nothing holding you back, other than a voice that questions whether or not you have the talent or skills. The answer is “yes”, so stop stalling and get to work!

"
3991,4 april 2018,virgo,"Virgos have the stereotype of being oh so practical, but you love swag just as much as the rest of us. Maybe a little too much these days, thanks to Mars blazing a path through your house of luxury and entertainment. Start being selective about how much you spend and where you spend it.

"
3992,5 april 2018,virgo,"Pushing people for answers may sound like a good idea initially but will probably backfire instead. Yes, your emotions may be going all over the place, but trying to pin people down will only create more agita.

"
3993,6 april 2018,virgo,"You may have been feeling apprehensive about what’s going on in your life, but it’s all a part of growth and change. A sparkling Uranus aspect today enables you to break out of your comfort zone…even if that’s just a tiny bit!

"
3994,7 april 2018,virgo,"You’re in no mood these days for trying to figure out what’s going on in someone else’s mind, that’s for sure. Let others know that you need to understand what they’re all about if your relationship is going to work.

"
3995,8 april 2018,virgo,"You may need to come on a bit strong today in order to get your point across. But that’s OK. You don’t have to yell or create a lot of drama; just say what needs to be said. You’ll be glad later this week that you got it all out there.

"
3996,9 april 2018,virgo,"You may think that all of your ideas are right on point, but from your chart it appears that some of them are out of date. Accept that personal growth requires facing certain truths. Besides, changing your mindset will be more liberating than you might imagine.

"
3997,10 april 2018,virgo,"Behind that self-confident exterior is a person who might be feeling a bit insecure these days. Don’t worry, this is a temporary blip on the cosmic radar. You’ll be feeling feisty again by Thursday.

"
3998,11 april 2018,virgo,"Yes! Mars and Venus, those lusty cosmic lovers, form a terrific aspect. Venus is in your house of optimism and adventure, while the red planet is stationed in your house of frisky romance. Gotta love this energy. This is no time to settle for a boring love life!

"
3999,12 april 2018,virgo,"You’re not a showy person by nature but sometimes you need to be recognized for everything that you do. So stop hiding your light under a bushel and step out into the sunshine, my friend. Work what you’ve got and don’t hold back.

"
4000,13 april 2018,virgo,"Lucky Jupiter will spend most of 2018 in your house of socializing. It’s a tough job, Virgo, but someone has to do it and it might as well be you. Over the next few days you should put your chores and worries aside and enjoy life, as Jupiter is in a playful mood. Attention single people: be on the lookout for a new flame.

"
4001,14 april 2018,virgo,"Red hot Mars is pushing hard for changes on the home front, whatever that means to you: moving in with a lover, relocating to a different state, redecorating, settling family battles or dealing with an ex. Fortunately inspirational Neptune is on the case too, making things flow more easily than usual.

"
4002,15 april 2018,virgo,"Mercury has been retrograde in one emotional place, your eighth house. This sector governs love, sex and money, so if the last few weeks have been difficult in these areas, now you know why. The little bugger goes direct today, so take a deep breath and exhale. A more prosperous and fulfilling six month period lies ahead, FYI.

"
4003,16 april 2018,virgo,"Love and money are the topics that capture our attention, and today’s new moon in Aries focuses on both for Virgos. It’s time to develop a more mature, long-term view of the future when it comes to your net worth and your relationships. There’s no more room for drama or uncertainty.

"
4004,17 april 2018,virgo,"Love and lust are not always the same thing. If you’re lucky they’ll coexist within a relationship. If not, you may need to fix things. The recent new moon occurred in your sexuality sector, opening up an exciting new phase in intimacy. But today stern Saturn begins to retrograde in your romance house, asking you if balance exists.

"
4005,18 april 2018,virgo,"Mind your money today, Virgo. A sizzling Sun-Uranus aspect is smokin’ hot when it comes to locating a fabulous investment opportunity or entering into some kind of business venture. But you might be tempted to spend or invest more than you should. Keep things real.

"
4006,19 april 2018,virgo,"Confidence is sexy and it’s time for you to become more confident! Fortunately a lively lunar aspect puts you in the driver’s seat—and it’s a Lamborghini. Go out there and strut your stuff.

"
4007,20 april 2018,virgo,"Your ideas about love, risk and living a bolder life are about to change, Virgo. Planetary activity in the two houses that deal with creativity and putting yourself out there are putting you in a reflective place. If a complete life overhaul seems intimidating, why not start with some baby steps? Little changes add up, dontcha know.

"
4008,21 april 2018,virgo,"Sharing the same values as the other people in your world is important, Virgo. You don’t have to be a clone of your friends or lover, but it certainly helps to share some of the same ideals and dreams. Do an assessment and see who fits. Are you giving away who you truly are in order to fit in with the crowd?

"
4009,22 april 2018,virgo,"If you want to “rewrite” your love life, now’s the time to do so! Powerful Pluto goes retrograde in your house of romance, asking what you  need and desire. From your chart it appears that you won’t be settling for table scraps, so start writing that list of demands right now!

"
4010,23 april 2018,virgo,"Sharing is caring? Maybe not! With the Moon in your hush-hush zone, you should be careful about what you reveal today. This is more of an issue in your personal life than your professional one. Steer clear of blabbing about your life on social media: this is not the best moment for TMI.

"
4011,24 april 2018,virgo,"Getting things done your way becomes a lot easier now that gentle Venus is in Gemini. Beating people over the head won’t be necessary; a quiet sense of authority will work far better. You’re currently in a place where creativity counts for a lot, so think about fresh ways of handling old problems.

"
4012,25 april 2018,virgo,"“That’s not logical, Captain!”  Go into Vulcan mode today and do your best Spock imitation. Operate purely on rational thought and avoid allowing emotions to color your thinking. A Mercury-Saturn square demands using the left side of your brain.

"
4013,27 april 2018,virgo,"You may be dying to treat yourself with some swag or an expensive vacation. Maybe you’re lusting after a Maseratti or some designer clothes. Yup, golden girl Venus is in full glam mode and she wants to spend, spend, spend. But don’t go there, at least not today.

"
4014,28 april 2018,virgo,"A battle between your heart and your head may be raging as you try to decide which direction to head in. Don’t make any major decisions today. Instead, wait for Monday’s full moon, a much better time. This lunation occurs in your house of thinking and strategizing, making it the perfect moment for closure.

"
4015,29 april 2018,virgo,"Persistence pays off, Virgo! Your sign is already famous for its discipline but now’s the time to buckle down and put in some more hard work. The rewards will be worth it, though. A little tip from the cosmos: your workload will lighten and flow more easily if you take a more creative approach to getting things done.

"
4016,30 april 2018,virgo,"An idea or project that you’ve been working on may finally start to fall into place, Virgo! The full moon in your house of thinking and expression could also bring in people who see the genius of your ideas….and they want to partner with you. Your creativity is exceptionally high right now, so make the most of it.

"
4017,1 may 2018,virgo,"A battle between your logical mind and your emotions could arise as Uranus opposes the Moon. La Luna is in a quite practical place, pointing out strategies and smart ways of thinking and expressing yourself. But erratic Uranus is pitching a hissy pit from your way-too-emo eighth house, demanding to be heard. A piece of advice: let logic win this one!

"
4018,2 may 2018,virgo,"Who’s the boss in your closest relationships, Virgo? No matter how gentle or accommodating you might be these days, others may be downright confrontational. Remember that this is their sh**, not yours. Let them stew and move on with your daily activities.

"
4019,3 may 2018,virgo,"With Jupiter retrograde in your house of self-expression, you may be feeling tongue tied or lacking in confidence. This little storm passes quickly and by tomorrow your energy will be on the upswing. So will flirting, chatting and planning some fun escapades with the people you love.

"
4020,4 may 2018,virgo,"Playing for keeps? You have a lot of planets in your flirty, frisky fifth house, but it looks like you want some seriousness mixed in with the fun and games. If you’re single or with someone who doesn’t float your boat, the next few weeks could bring in an enticing person who’s a break from the same old, same old.

"
4021,5 may 2018,virgo,"The cosmos is telling you that if you want to get ahead in this world, you need to know what your strengths and weaknesses are. Sometimes this is a difficult task, being that honest about yourself. But a helpful Moon-Pluto aspect will enable you to get to the bottom of your psyche with ease.

"
4022,6 may 2018,virgo,"The following week will be a wonky one in which your ability to get along with others will be fine one day, then tested the next. Today is a good day, especially when it comes to having fun with a lover or pals who really know how to live la vida loca. Find people who are interested in having an escapade!

"
4023,7 may 2018,virgo,"Avoid “group think” like the plague today, Virgo. People around you may be trying to get you to think their way or follow their agenda, and they could resort to underhanded means in the process. Don’t fall for it.

"
4024,8 may 2018,virgo,"This is not a good time to over promise and under deliver. Nor is it a smart moment to fudge something on a term paper or blab too much on social media. Hold off on product launches too, if you can. A stern Sun-Jupiter opposition will put your words and deeds under a microscope. This doesn’t last long though: by Friday the coast is clear.

"
4025,9 may 2018,virgo,"Consistency counts, and the people in your world need to know that you are reliable. This is true of your behavior, moods and work ethic. This doesn’t mean that you can’t be fun, though, or have fun!

"
4026,10 may 2018,virgo,"Your ability to cooperate with others grows thanks to a happy Neptunian aspect. But after this week you may go the Lone Ranger route, surging forward with your own agenda. Just remember that you’ll need some help along the way.

"
4027,11 may 2018,virgo,"An amazing Sun-Pluto trine blows the doors off preconceived notions you’ve had about yourself, Virgo. Your courage and creativity are soaring, so don’t even think about trying to fight this feeling! Besides, once Uranus enters Taurus next Tuesday, you’ll be experiencing this vibe for the next eight years.

"
4028,12 may 2018,virgo,"Hold your horses there, pardner! This is not a good day to try to lasso someone into an agreement. The harder you push the more they’ll resist. Give things more time. Either that, or move on.

"
4029,13 may 2018,virgo,"Got a message you want to get out there? Thinking about expanding your mind (and your options) by signing up for a course of study? Thinking about writing a book or starting a blog? Then hop to it! Quick thinking Mercury is now in your ninth house, the place where we take risks and absorb new information.

"
4030,14 may 2018,virgo,"Spunky Uranus tells you to take a risk and put your emotions out there! Vulnerability is not always a bad thing, and holding things in can cause so much unhappiness. You’ve grown a lot as a person over the past eight years. Why not let the world see whom you have become?

"
4031,15 may 2018,virgo,"Who wants to play by the rules? Not you anymore! Rebellious Uranus is now in your free thinking, adventurous ninth house. The next eight years are super for getting involved in activities that push you past your comfort level. This includes romance, by the way, so don’t be afraid to take a chance on a different type.

"
4032,16 may 2018,virgo,"Distant lands are calling your name, Virgo! So are universities and new friends and sexy lovers. So are beaches and restaurants and terrific books. The new moon falls in your house of travel, education and taking some calculated risks. Between now and November your mind will expand exponentially!

"
4033,17 may 2018,virgo,"With Mars is in your efficiency sector, you are hell bent on getting things done. So much so that if the slightest delay crops up, you could lose your cool. The same goes for slackers in your midst. Remember that things need time to manifest, and that they’re not conveniently going to happen on your schedule.

"
4034,18 may 2018,virgo,"Creativity soars with a winning Mercury-Saturn trine! No matter what you do for a living, or if you’re a stay-at-home parent, you need to develop your talent. Now is the perfect time to sign up for a class or block time for working on things that will help you shine.

"
4035,19 may 2018,virgo,"The company you keep becomes more important than usual now that Venus is in your house of networking. Your social calendar could fill up over the next three weeks as you book dinners, cocktails and movie dates with your friends. Industry events could bear fruit too, so don’t leave them out.

"
4036,20 may 2018,virgo,"Got goals? I sure hope so because now is the best time in 2018 to go after them! The Sun is now in your house of ambition and success, a place it will remain for four weeks. Considering that Venus entered your house of mentors and networking yesterday, one of the smartest things that you could do is to align yourself with movers and shakers.

"
4037,21 may 2018,virgo,"Your subconscious mind could be in full blown fantasy mode, but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing! You could get more in touch with your creative side. Or your lusty, adventurous one. Don’t worry, you won’t go overboard with this! Logical Saturn is balancing out this energy.

"
4038,22 may 2018,virgo,"Anyone who thinks that you do everything by the book is way off, Virgo. A series of stellar aspects over the next week will heighten your ability to come up with cutting edge, new ideas. These people may end up being shocked, but so be it. Sometimes it’s kind of fun being underestimated!

"
4039,23 may 2018,virgo,"If in doubt, don’t say it….or do it! A tense Mercury-Jupiter opposition warns against making promises you can’t deliver on. Likewise, make sure that you’re not indulging in wishful thinking when it comes to any big plans. The approaching full moon on the 29th will help you make practical decisions, so wait until then if you can.

"
4040,24 may 2018,virgo,"By the inch it’s a cinch, by the yard it’s hard. That old saying applies to you today as the planets line up in your houses of organization and making progress. Motivational Mars is in a good spot to get you off and running as you dig into projects that may have seemed overwhelming in the past.

"
4041,25 may 2018,virgo,"New age gurus like to preach about how “abundance is everywhere” and that we’re all entitled to a life full of goodies. This can sound trite and unrealistic, but today you may actually have a sense that this is possible. A wonderful Jupiter-Neptune trine could open your mind to the idea that yes, you can  live a wonderful life and that it’s your turn to grab that brass ring.

"
4042,26 may 2018,virgo,"Expressing what’s going on inside of you is what it’s all about today, Virgo! This includes expressing your love and affection for someone. Talking about your latest cool plan or idea. Creating vacation plans with your family, lover or tribe. Let it out!

"
4043,27 may 2018,virgo,"Do the people around you share the same values as you, Virgo? Naturally everyone has different ideas about how to run their lives, and you don’t want to associate with people who are clones of you. But if other people in your world are starting to head in a direction that you don’t care for, then pull away.

"
4044,28 may 2018,virgo,"Your mind is full of logical thoughts, so why are you so unsure of yourself? Could be the Moon in Scorpio, which is making you bit fearful that things aren’t going to work out the way you’d like. If in doubt, don’t voice your worries. Tomorrow’s full moon will bring some much needed clarity.

"
4045,29 may 2018,virgo,"If family members or a lover have been taking you for granted, tonight’s full moon is a great time to take back some control. It occurs in your domestic sector, shedding light on issues that may have been troubling you. Shrewd Mercury glides into the most authoritative part of your chart too, telling you to quietly and calmly step into a place of greater personal power.

"
4046,30 may 2018,virgo,"How happy we are in life often has to do with how we’re being treated by other people. A tense Moon-Neptune aspect could create static in a close relationship, and you might react quite emotionally. But remember that in the end, you have control over your own thoughts—which in turn creates your emotions.

"
4047,31 may 2018,virgo,"The things you want in life may be closer at hand than you may think, Virgo. It’s time to think more creatively. Stop waiting for your ship to come in. Instead, swim out to meet it.

"
4048,1 june 2018,virgo,"It’s time to walk the walk if you’re going to talk the talk, Virgo. A promising Mercury-Mars aspect tells you to take your grand ideas and start breaking them down into bite-sized, workable chunks. This could be anything from a fitness plan to finding new love to launching a start-up. Stop dreaming and start doing.

"
4049,2 june 2018,virgo,"No man or woman can get through life without the help of others, something that you may need to be reminded about. Fortunately, finding people who are willing to lend a helping hand gets easier with a Venus-Neptune trine. Be prepared to pitch in and help them in return.

"
4050,3 june 2018,virgo,"With Mars touring your house of habits and routines, you’re probably aware that changes need to be made. This includes your health as well as the way you get things done at home and at the office. But acting hastily will backfire. Think things through before you commit to a new plan or system.

"
4051,4 june 2018,virgo,"There is so much that you can go after and accomplish these days. The two most logical and strategic orbs, the Sun and Mercury, meet up in your house of ambition, stirring up fresh ideas. But you’re better off relying on your own inner wisdom than the advice of other people, as deceptive Neptune is swirling its mist.

"
4052,5 june 2018,virgo,"Someone in a pissy mood may be out there with a sharp pin in their hand, just looking for someone’s bubble to burst. Avoid known malcontents if you can, Virgo. But if you can’t, let this slide. An air of teamwork arrives next week when Mercury enters Cancer.

"
4053,6 june 2018,virgo,"You know where you’re  going….why is everyone else so confused? Don’t let the indecisiveness of others affect you over the next 48 hours, Virgo. Let them figure out their own issues or path through life. We all have lessons to learn and it’s time for them to figure this out.

"
4054,7 june 2018,virgo,"With the Sun in your house of ambition, you’re right on point when it comes to your future path. From your chart it appears that you’re better off flying solo these days rather than taking on partners. They may actually hold you back, despite their promises to the contrary. If a lover is trying to slow you down, they need to be set straight!

"
4055,8 june 2018,virgo,"In astrology, the eighth house governs sex, intimacy and your emotions. The Moon glides into this sector today, possibly making this a steamy weekend! But you have to watch out for emotions raging out of control as obsessive Pluto is in a difficult spot.

"
4056,9 june 2018,virgo,"Passion! We all want it. It’s the stuff that books and movies are made of. What really floats your boat, Virgo? That’s the question the cosmos asks of you today. If you’ve been hiding in the shadows, afraid to live la vida loca, then it’s time to take a few chances.

"
4057,10 june 2018,virgo,"With the Moon entering the most optimistic part of your chart, your spirits should start to rise. You’re about to enter a social phase in which working closely with others is important. This just doesn’t mean at the office; charitable work, joining a sports team or pooling your skills with fellow hobbyists could reap fun rewards.

"
4058,11 june 2018,virgo,"With optimistic Jupiter in your house of self-expression, you should feel free to say what’s on your mind! Who cares if others don’t like it? They’re probably more annoyed with how confident you are rather than the content of your message.

"
4059,12 june 2018,virgo,"If you’re smart you’ll work on developing a bigger contact list, Virgo. Convivial Mercury is now in your house of networking, and some of the people you’ll meet could play a big part in the months and years to come. This is true in love and business, not to mention just making some fabulous new friends.

"
4060,13 june 2018,virgo,"Every year you get a gift from the cosmos: a new moon in the house of ambition and success. Today is the day, so over the next six months you can pursue just about any dream your brain can come up with. But with Venus entering the hush-hush zone, you’d be wise to keep some of these plans under wraps for the time being.

"
4061,14 june 2018,virgo,"Uneasiness about the direction that a plan is heading may arise today, Virgo. Either that or someone pulls a switcheroo that puts everything in question. Your best bet is to observe quietly and say little. Your intuition is sharp, so rely on it for hidden intel.

"
4062,15 june 2018,virgo,"You don’t owe anything to anybody—so why are they acting that way? It’s due to the Mercury-Saturn opposition in your house of  friends and close contacts. Even a lover could cop an attitude. Things improve on Tuesday, so walk away from their nonsense for now.

"
4063,16 june 2018,virgo,"Creating deeper connections with people is in the stars over the next week, and you could also meet some interesting new people. This is your best time in 2018 to lend a hand to a charity or get involved in volunteer work. It’s also a great time to join meet-ups in your area to connect with people who have interests similar to yours.

"
4064,17 june 2018,virgo,"You may have more support than you realize from others, Virgo. It may not be readily apparent but there are those who believe in you.  But first you need to start believing in yourself.

"
4065,18 june 2018,virgo,"Yikes! Which way is a romantic relationship heading in? Both Saturn and Pluto have been retrograde in your house of love. And today amorous Neptune starts to swim backward in your house of commitment. If you’re attached, it’s time to review your union; if you’re single, it may be time to consider your values and what you’re looking for in a mate.

"
4066,19 june 2018,virgo,"Working well with others is going to be a lot more important over the next month, and today a super aspect helps you pull the team together. It’s also a good time for running ideas past a trusted friend or mentor, so don’t be afraid to ask for advice. Seminars and podcasts could also be a great source of inspiration.

"
4067,20 june 2018,virgo,"One of the smartest things we can do in life is to align ourselves with others who share our dreams and values. Today is a good time to meet new people who fit this bill. It’s also an auspicious moment to hash things out (pleasantly) with friends and loved ones.

"
4068,21 june 2018,virgo,"There’s an old saying: keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer! The Sun enters your house of friends and contacts today, but there’s a warning attached—make sure you’ve vetted everyone. Sometimes you can’t disassociate from trouble makers easily, like at the office for instance. But you can limit what you say to them, so start being selective.

"
4069,22 june 2018,virgo,"If you’re interested in aligning yourself with a group of people (friends, neighbors) who know how to live the good life, this weekend is a good time to meet them. The same goes for hooking up with cutting edge thinkers and mentors in your profession. You ever know where these connections may lead!

"
4070,23 june 2018,virgo,"Trying to figure out what’s going on in someone’s mind is useless, Virgo. People around you may be acting out, dramatic, difficult to read. Let them have the stage. Their antics may continue into next week, and by Friday the 29th you may decide to pull away a bit.

"
4071,24 june 2018,virgo,"With so much planetary activity in one of the most joyful parts of your chart, it would be a shame to be focused on the nyah-nyah stuff. So kick crummy thoughts to the curb and get about the business of having fun. The cosmos demands it.

"
4072,25 june 2018,virgo,"What you think and what you say (or write) are two different things today, Virgo. A Venus-Jupiter square warns against speaking too freely, even if it’s simply expressing your emotions to a loved one. Once Mercury enters your house of confidentiality on Friday, you’ll understand why.

"
4073,26 june 2018,virgo,"You seem to have your fingers in too many pies, running after one activity, then another. The problem is that you’ll never get all of them done. Now that Mars is retrograde in the efficiency part of your chart you can slow down and choose which projects are worth pursuing.

"
4074,27 june 2018,virgo,"Keeping your emotions in check could be a challenge, thanks to the impending full moon arriving in the most dramatic part of your chart tomorrow. To make matters even more heated, friends and colleagues could be sticking their nose in your business or offering advice that is off base. Avoid thinking with your heart and use your head instead.
 
 

"
4075,28 june 2018,virgo,"Sick and tired of playing by other people’s rules? If that’s the case, tonight’s full moon could bring things to a head. The good news is that it will open up a glorious new chapter in which you can let your freak flag fly. Juicier romance, enjoying hobbies and sports, taking in cultural events, living a more colorful life….all of these are on offer for you.

"
4076,29 june 2018,virgo,"A steamy, sexy time can begin as lively Mercury enters your house of behind-closed-doors activities. Sure, you could use this energy to quietly look for a new job, but isn’t it time for some action in the boudoir? Secret crushes are also a good possibility!

"
4077,30 june 2018,virgo,"Someone may say or do something that will catch you off guard. It could be that they’re overly opinionated or they throw a monkey wrench into your plans. The problem is that your own thinking and intuition will be off, so don’t react right away. Wait a few days for clarity to return.

"
4078,1 july 2018,virgo,"Sometimes you can get more done by being laid back than by being aggressive, and this is one of those times. That doesn’t mean that you should avoid people. By all means speak to them, work with them….but be more relaxed in your approach.

"
4079,2 july 2018,virgo,"Virgos are pragmatic souls, but that doesn’t mean that they aren’t romantic. Au contraire! A wonderful Saturn aspect helps you get in touch with your softer, more sentimental side. That said, you still want guarantees….and no unnecessary drama.

"
4080,3 july 2018,virgo,"It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it that counts! And with lucky Jupiter in fine form from your house of communicating, you’ll have no problem in speaking with confidence. Don’t be surprised if others want to join forces with you, and this includes romance.

"
4081,4 july 2018,virgo,"This can be quite an amorous day thanks to the Moon winking at Neptune across the heavens. You can choose to hole yourself up in ye old boudoir with your lover, but there’s a highly social aspect going on too. So head outside and create your own private fireworks later.

"
4082,5 july 2018,virgo,"They say that people make the world go round and in your case, it’s completely true! A super Sun-Jupiter aspect can put you in touch with the right kind of people–a new lover, friends, mentors or movers and shakers. So don’t sit at home watching TV. The next few weeks are well aspected for broadening your social circle.

"
4083,6 july 2018,virgo,"Slow down! You need to give both your body and mind some time to rebalance after a lot of exertion. Yes, you have a lot on your plate and need to get things done…but if you don’t take better care of yourself you’ll end up burning out. And how will that help?

"
4084,7 july 2018,virgo,"A sudden urge to pack your bags and head to the airport could strike, thanks to wild card Uranus acting up in your house of travel. And if you can’t get out of town, you should at least take the day off and head out for a local adventure.

"
4085,8 july 2018,virgo,"What a fabulous day to get on the same page with someone! A helpful Sun-Neptune trine is just the ticket for sharing your ideas and opinions. It’s also possible that new people are anxious to join you on your journey through life, so be open to making some new connections.

4086,9 july 2018,virgo,"It’s your time to shine, Virgo! Glamorous Venus glides into your sign today. Not only is this a good time for pampering yourself, it’s also an auspicious moment for getting your message out there. Jupiter resumes direct motion in your house of communication tomorrow.

"
4087,10 july 2018,virgo,"Now that bountiful Jupiter has gone direct, you can say what is on your mind, Virgo. The next three weeks are highly auspicious for getting your reputation and talents out there too. You may surprise a few people with your opinions, but that’s okay. They need to be shaken up.

"
4088,11 july 2018,virgo,"Anyone who thinks that Virgos are boring, by-the-book kind of people is in for a big surprise today! Spunky Uranus is on fire in your house of adventure, stirring you take bigger chances. And with happy Venus in your sign, you’re not going to be afraid to go for it.

"
4089,13 july 2018,virgo,"Some amazing new people can come into your life over the next few months, Virgo. Today’s solar eclipse takes place in your house of networking and friends. You could also have a heck of a lot of fun with your existing tribe. But will there be time for love? A strong Pluto opposition indicates that you may be more interested in keeping things light and carefree, rather than staying in a couple bubble.

"
4090,14 july 2018,virgo,"It’s time to make some long-lasting changes to your life, Virgo. A stellar Venus-Saturn aspect will give you just the boost you need to make some much-needed changes. The best place to start is with your appearance and your love life.

"
4091,15 july 2018,virgo,"Need a partner in crime? The cosmos is encouraging you to find exciting new people to have fun with. You could also benefit by finding an intelligent mentor, or some business contacts that will help you make headway. A more adventurous new chapter in love could also begin.

"
4092,16 july 2018,virgo,"What floats your boat, Virgo? Today you should be chasing after what pleases you the most! That’s because the Moon and Venus meet up in your sign, a wonderful aspect for getting in touch with your dearest desires. Other people may try to talk you out of things, but don’t pay any attention to them. It’s your life and you have to live it your way.

"
4093,17 july 2018,virgo,"It’s not your karma to be broke and always scraping for money, Virgo. A stinky lunar aspect may make you feel that way today, but it’s not the case. Once the Sun enters Leo next Sunday, you’ll be able to do some deep reflecting about your attitude concerning money and wealth. Better yet? You’ll be able to uncover some savvy ways to earn and save more.

"
4094,18 july 2018,virgo,"Slackers, beware! Virgos have ambitious Mars in their house organization and they are ready to roll…..right over you, if you don’t get your damn job done. There’s nothing wrong today with letting people know that you’re expecting them to pick up the slack. But once the Sun rolls in to Leo on Sunday, keep your opinions to yourself.

"
4095,20 july 2018,virgo,"This could be quite a romantic day with the passionate Moon winking at amorous Neptune. Your charisma is high these days, and you’re in the mood for some secluded action.

"
4097,22 july 2018,virgo,"The next few weeks are some of the best in 2018 for mental and physical healing. The Sun has just entered Leo, your twelfth house of closure and transition. This is where we take stock of the issues that we’re dealing with and vow to take care of them. Mercury retrograde in this sector on Thursday, which actually is a benefit. This will help you get a handle on the inner workings of your mind.

"
4098,23 july 2018,virgo,"Tired of being the family go-to person? It’s likely with a tense Moon-Neptune square. Don’t let others use guilt or flattery to get their way with you.

"
4099,24 july 2018,virgo,"Stick to your guns, Virgo! Gentle Venus in your sign is opposed by Neptune today. Someone may try to take advantage of your good nature. This is no time to be a pushover. You can protect your position without creating a lot of drama.

"
4100,25 july 2018,virgo,"Everyone is entitled to my opinion? Someone around you may be quite bossy today, Virgo. They may be so in love with their own ideas that they can’t see the flaws in them. Don’t bother pointing this out; it will only backfire. Let them figure it out for themselves over time.

"
4101,26 july 2018,virgo,"Heal thyself, Virgo. Mental Mercury has just gone retrograde in one of the most cathartic parts of your chart.

4108,2 august 2018,virgo,"Try a different approach with a loved one, Virgo. With the Moon in the most intimate part of your chart, you should be able to make progress. Make sure the words that you say have meaning, and that they come directly from the heart.

"
4109,3 august 2018,virgo,"The cosmos is pushing you to take a few calculated risks… so why are you afraid to do so? A tricky Moon-Sun square is raising concerns in your mind. But that’s okay. Intelligent Mercury is on the case, and by the end of next week you’ll have everything figured out.

"
4110,4 august 2018,virgo,"People who think that you play by the rules are in for a big surprise, Virgo! Eccentric Uranus is active today, encouraging you to do something totally uncharacteristic. This doesn’t mean starting a rebellion or quitting the day job. But you could switch up something about your life to make things more creative and exciting.

"
4111,5 august 2018,virgo,"Your intuition may be giving you guidance about a romantic situation, and if you’re smart you’ll pay attention to it. The same holds true for matters concerning children, if you have them. It seems as though you need to take greater control over a situation, and your inner wisdom is trying to show you how.

"
4112,6 august 2018,virgo,"A posh, sensual time begins now that posh Venus is in Libra. It’s time to start pampering yourself, and your lover as well. Trips to the spa, dinner at your favorite café, some swag…go for it. If you’re single and looking, a new lover could come in who is more mature and well established financially.

"
4113,7 august 2018,virgo,"Virgos are currently in one of the most mind expanding periods of their entire life. That’s because Uranus, the planet of innovative ideas, is in the most cutting edge, optimistic part of your chart. Anyone who views Virgos as not being creative, or too stuck in details, is in for a big surprise. Uranus goes retrograde today, a benefit as it will help you develop some ground breaking new plans.

"
4114,8 august 2018,virgo,"Relationships take a pragmatic turn today. That’s because Mars and Venus form a helpful aspect in the most practical parts of your chart. Sometimes and love ya just gotta down to brass tacks. That said, Mars is in the most physical part of your chart, so there could be some interesting “sporting activities” in the boudoir.

"
4115,9 august 2018,virgo,"With romantic Venus in your house of security, you need to have a strong foundation when it comes to love. Do you have one? That will be the question today, as Venus squares long-term Saturn. You need to think with your head as much as you do with your heart.

"
4116,10 august 2018,virgo,"You may be more reflective than usual, due to tomorrow’s solar eclipse occurring in the most secluded part of your chart. Ruminating over what needs to stay in your life and what needs to go is a smart move. But others may sense that you’re doing this important inner work, and they can try to throw you off track. If need be, pull away from other people for a few days.

"
4117,12 august 2018,virgo,"Yesterday’s solar eclipse demands that you reflect about the direction your life is heading in. And with Mars retrograding back into your house of romance today, this would be a good place to start. Just be aware that exes can return in this kind of a transit, and so can old dramas and issues. But you’re in a terrific position to take care of things for good.

"
4118,13 august 2018,virgo,"You won’t be in the mood to put up with anybody’s flak today, Virgo. With the Moon in your sign, you are looking out for number one. People may try to win you over to their way of thinking, but it’s not going to work. The recent solar eclipse has made you more interested than usual in getting rid of nonsense from people and situations that don’t serve you.

"
4119,14 august 2018,virgo,"It’s a good day for feeling more comfortable in your own skin, Virgo. A lovely lunar aspect will make you feel more confident and attractive. Naturally, that means that this is a good time to put yourself out there––whether on the job market or the marriage market!

"
4120,15 august 2018,virgo,"Your logical mind maybe saying one thing, while your heart says another. The problem is, you may be hellbent on getting an answer today to something that has been vexing you. With demanding Pluto in a tough spot, you could come on too strong. Chill out and let things take their course.

"
4121,16 august 2018,virgo,"Getting distracted is a real possibility, thanks to erratic Uranus acting out. A new idea or a new direction may pop into your head. Or someone may be anxious to get you to go down their path rather than yours. It’s important to remain focused. Once Mercury goes direct on Sunday, that should be easy.

"
4122,17 august 2018,virgo,"It’s time to open your mind to new things, so plan a trip out of town to a place you’ve never been before. Or join a club. Maybe you should read a different kind of book, or visit a museum. Cosmic activity in one of the most social and thoughtful parts of your chart is encouraging you to expand your world.
 

"
4123,18 august 2018,virgo,"Problems in your love life and financial situation could ease up, thanks to a stellar Mercury-Venus aspect. It’s a great time for talking things over with people or brainstorming solutions. When the Sun enters your sign next Thursday, it’s all systems go.

"
4124,19 august 2018,virgo,"If you have felt a tad confused, or haven’t been sure which direction to head in, you can breathe a sigh of relief. The reason for the mental mess was that Mercury was retrograde in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. It goes direct today, just in time for your birthday season, which begins on Thursday.

"
4125,21 august 2018,virgo,"If you need to have a serious talk with a lover, today is a good day to do so. Wise old Saturn is in a good position to help you discuss long term plans. If you’re looking for love, a new flame could be out there, someone who could go the distance.

"
4126,22 august 2018,virgo,"It’s one thing to love someone; it’s another thing to obsess over them….or what they’re up to. Don’t let fears get the better you today. The Moon has been in a very emotional spot lately, blowing things out of proportion. Once the Sun rolls into your sign tomorrow, you’ll be feeling stronger and more resilient.

"
4127,23 august 2018,virgo,"Yay! The Sun is now in your sign, crowning you the celestial favorite. What’s going to make this birthday season so different from those of the past is the cosmic emphasis on love. Pluto, Saturn and red hot Mars are all in this part of your chart. The next four weeks are awesome for finding new love, jazzing up an existing relationship or even having a baby.

"
4128,24 august 2018,virgo,"Matters of the heart can get quite intense today, and this can either be a good thing or a bad thing. If jealousy and drama take over, you could spend the day fighting with a lover. But if you channel this energy correctly, you could have the time of your life. Singles, the next three or four days are excellent for meeting someone new.

"
4129,25 august 2018,virgo,"When the Sun is in someone’s sign–like it is for you right now–it can be easy to just focus on what you want, and to strike off on a solitary path. But cosmic activity this weekend indicates that people will want to join you on your journey, and if you’re smart you’ll take them along. We’re talking about lovers, friends and new connections (and these people know how to dream big).

"
4130,26 august 2018,virgo,"Relationship issues are now front and center, thanks to tonight’s full moon in your house of commitment. The message behind this lunation is that you need to be on equal footing with a lover. Head trips and power plays have to go, along with enabling someone and unstable conditions. If someone can’t go along with that, then you may need to make some changes.

"
4131,27 august 2018,virgo,"You’re not willing to let someone else call the shots when it comes to romance. And why should you? Ambitious Mars is in this part of your chart and goes direct today, making you more determined than ever to have a love relationship go your way for once. Just make sure that you don’t get too pushy though, a possibility under the circumstances.

"
4132,28 august 2018,virgo,"Your sign is famous for its practical nature, which means that you can sniff out a phony person a mile away. Today’s cosmic energy indicates that a passive aggressive type may be in your midst. No need to freak out over this; just calmly observe them. But don’t get involved in any of their suggestions, as they’ll be looking out for #1.

"
4133,29 august 2018,virgo,"From your chart it appears that you need to loosen up your grip on things, Virgo. This could be relationships with a lover, family members or kids. It could be your future goals. Maybe you’re desperately awaiting an outcome of some kind. Let things take their natural course and relax more.

"
4134,30 august 2018,virgo,"Balancing a calm exterior with turbulent inner emotions could be difficult today! But it needs to be done, so keep calm and carry on. Tomorrow is a better day for doing things your way, fierce and proud.

"
4135,31 august 2018,virgo,"Your motivation rises to create sweeping changes. Sitting around waiting for things to improve just isn’t going to cut it for you. So dive in, and if anyone is holding you back, push them to the side.

"
4136,1 september 2018,virgo,"You may be overly concerned about your reputation these days, but is there really any basis to your worries? When shrewd Mercury enters Virgo this coming Wednesday you’ll be able to see things from a higher perspective.

"
4137,2 september 2018,virgo,"If you’re feeling like “The Little Train That Could”, that’s because a strong lunar aspect is encouraging you to dig deep and do more. You’re capable of quite more than you may realize. Open your eyes.

"
4138,3 september 2018,virgo,"If there is a plan you have in mind, something that you’d like to achieve, then push forward silently. There is a time and place for going public, but it’s not now. That time arrives on the 9th when the new moon occurs in your sign.

"
4139,4 september 2018,virgo,"You know what you want and what you like…..so why are others trying to talk you out of it? Don’t pay attention to the opinions of others, no matter how well meaning they may be. It’s also possible that they’re a little jealous of you and your ideals.

"
4140,5 september 2018,virgo,"The Sun has been in your sign for some time now, but now Mercury joins the birthday party. This is going to speed up your mental process. The next few weeks are awesome for strategizing and planning the future. Start now, because the new Moon on the 9th is when the doors open.

"
4141,6 september 2018,virgo,"Ready for taking a chance on love? Over the past few months stern Saturn has been retrograde in your house of romance. You may have been thinking over what you need in matters of the heart. Or maybe you were taking a breather from the whole scene! Now it’s time to dive back in and have some fun, as Saturn has gone direct.

"
4142,7 september 2018,virgo,"Hurricane Virgo is here! Nothing, and I mean nothing, is going to stop you today. Inspiration strikes a big as brilliant Uranus is churning out ideas. Your magnetism is high due to the Sun and Mercury in your sign. And mature Saturn is in a wonderful aspect from your house in talent, showing the world that you have the chops to get the job done. Gotta love it!

"
4143,8 september 2018,virgo,"Part of you wants to do things the old way, yet another part wants to charge off into brave new territory! Don’t worry, this cosmic energy passes quickly. Tomorrow’s new Moon is in your sign, and it opens up a six month period in which you can figure out what’s best for you.

"
4144,9 september 2018,virgo,"Yasss!!!! The annual new moon in Virgo takes place today, and it’s a honey. It enables you to plant the seeds of new endeavors. In a sweet cosmic twist, Venus enters your house of thinking, planning and networking too. Considering that this planet governs love, you should be on the prowl for meeting someone new, or having more fun with your amour.

"
4145,10 september 2018,virgo,"Yesterday’s new Moon was in your sign, and chances are you are raring to go. And today energetic Mars blasts into your house of efficiency. You are going to become a force of nature! But that doesn’t mean that everyone around you shares your level of motivation, or that they’re interested in the same things. Be aware that you may be doing some things by yourself.

"
4146,11 september 2018,virgo,"The stars are aligning perfectly for you over the next few days, Virgo. Two days ago there was a new Moon in your sign, which is opening up doors that may have  been firmly shut. And today the Sun is winking at lucky Jupiter, dousing you with charisma. It’s a wonderful day for showing off your skills. It’s also well aspected for love, so don’t let them charisma go to waste.

"
4147,12 september 2018,virgo,"With generous Jupiter and magnetic Venus in the most open and expressive part of your chart, you’re willing to put yourself out there. This is smart, as it can help you get ahead in your career and love life. Will everyone be thrilled with your ideas? No. Expect some resistance, but don’t let it stop you.

"
4148,13 september 2018,virgo,"Your patience will be running thin with people who are trying to push their own agenda, Virgo. But that’s not going to stop them from trying! Don’t allow others to use fear or guilt to get their way. If you need to set someone straight, wait until tomorrow or Saturday to do so.

"
4149,14 september 2018,virgo,"A battle is brewing between your need for comfort and security, and the desire to take a few chances. This isn’t surprising, considering that the fiery Sun is in your sign. The smartest thing you can do is take some baby steps toward something that excites you, rather than leaping in head first.

"
4150,15 september 2018,virgo,"This is one of the best years ever to get involved in activities that make your heart sing. Hobbies, sports, art classes, learning how to cook, gardening—all of these are recommended. It can’t be all about work all the time. Make a promise today to set aside time every weekend (or maybe every day) for something that relaxes you.

"
4151,16 september 2018,virgo,"Remember what the genie said to Aladdin: “Your wish is my command?”  Well, at least one wish. Virgo, you’re in a smokin’ hot position to get your wishes granted over the next 48 hours. But as they say in the selling business, “You don’t ask, you don’t get.” Wise words—pay attention to them.

"
4152,17 september 2018,virgo,"Flirting and playing the field can be fun, but it also has its drawbacks. Today you’re going to be craving more security (and sanity!) when it comes to love. Whether you’re single or attached, consider what you need to make that happen. Wednesday of this week happens to be an auspicious time to get your way.

"
4153,18 september 2018,virgo,"Remember when your mother used to say, “Just because your friends jump off a bridge, should you do the same thing?” Well, Virgo, it’s that kind of a day. Except this time it’s not your Mama saying this, it’s Mars and Uranus. The bottom line is that you need to think things through carefully. This is not a good day for making snap decisions.

"
4154,19 september 2018,virgo,"The Sun will soon be leaving your sign, but that’s not something to be upset about. Today that fiery orb forms a fabulous angle with the Moon, encouraging you to chase after things that are on your bucket list. So pick a few items and get to work.

"
4155,20 september 2018,virgo,"This is a wonderful day for forming connections with other people, especially for love or business. Abundant Jupiter is encouraging open discussions and tossing around ideas, while Neptune is stirring up inspiration. Don’t be too hasty, though, to make any big decisions. Wait until the Sun enters your sign on Thursday.

"
4156,21 september 2018,virgo,"Show me the money! Now that shrewd Mercury is in your income sector, it’s time to start seeing more green. You’re in an excellent position to build wealth, serious money. But first you need to look at your spending and savings habits. If you’re sloppy with them, you’ll never develop a strong foundation.

"
4157,22 september 2018,virgo,"You need to become a lot more serious about your money situation, Libra. This may be easier than you think. The Sun enters your income sector today, so the next four weeks are well aspected for boosting your earnings and savings. But you have to watch out for needless or extravagant spending, especially next week.

"
4158,23 september 2018,virgo,"You need to get serious about saving more cash, Virgo. Tomorrow’s full moon occurs in your house of creating wealth. A Saturn-Mercury aspect today warns against spending on swag and unnecessary goodies. You have to start somewhere! Focus on the essentials only.

"
4159,24 september 2018,virgo,"People who stand in the middle the road get run over, Virgo.  You need to make a decision–about your financial situation or love life, from the looks of it. Tonight’s full moon will push you into making one. As for money, you do have the talent to earn more. And you don’t have to stay in a less than stellar relationship. Give yourself more credit than that.

"
4160,25 september 2018,virgo,"Do you even know how to have fun anymore? From your chart it appears that you’re really doing way too much, to the point where you can’t relax. This needs to come to an end, pronto. If you have to, block out time every day just for yourself: for hobbies, sports or hanging out with you care about.

"
4161,26 september 2018,virgo,"A happy lunar aspect enables you to take care of miscommunications today. Over the past week or two it may been hard to express yourself. Other people may have been moody and difficult. But now you have a chance to speak your mind, so go for it!

"
4162,27 september 2018,virgo,"You can’t assume that bosses or clients know how fabulous you are, Virgo. There’s nothing wrong with a little shameless self-promotion. So ask for the raise for the order. Ask for the job or the responsibility. You can handle it.

"
4163,28 september 2018,virgo,"Don’t assume that you can say anything to anyone today, Virgo. Even the most innocent remark could be taken the wrong way. Are people being way too touchy? Probably. But you don’t want to make any enemies.

"
4164,29 september 2018,virgo,"Do the rules need to be rewritten in a close relationship? It sure looks that way from your chart. The good news is that common, mature Saturn is in a good position to help you. And you won’t need to beat someone over the head to get your point across. Keep calm and carry on.

"
4165,30 september 2018,virgo,"It’s time to deal with facts, not fiction.  So if anyone is blowing smoke up your rear end, you need to set them straight. You’ve got places to go and people to meet, and you don’t have time for any nonsense.

"
4166,1 october 2018,virgo,"It’s one thing to help another person, and another to enable them. Despite your best efforts someone may not be appreciative of what you’re trying to do for them. Don’t forget, you have your own needs, which includes peace of mind.

"
4167,2 october 2018,virgo,"Your sign is famous for being rational, and this is a good thing. You’re going to need all of the common sense you can muster today, not to mention a cool façade. People could be dramatic, annoying or dictatorial. Don’t get involved in their messes and head trips.

"
4168,3 october 2018,virgo,"It’s Wednesday… officially known as hump day. If you need a little bit more fun to get you through the week, look no further than your friends. A sparkling Moon-Venus aspect is just the ticket for a fun night out on the town, or lunch with the girls. As the Beatles sang, “I get by with a little help from my friends.”

"
4169,4 october 2018,virgo,"There could be a sudden change in plans today, something that could throw you off your game, if you let it. People could also be opinionated and not willing to see the big picture. Once Mercury enters your communication sector next Tuesday, you’ll be able to get back on track.

"
4170,5 october 2018,virgo,"You are going to have to choose. Your. Words. Very. Carefully.  No, Mercury isn’t retrograde, but Venus sure is! In your house of communication too. Your brain could be operating more on emotions than rational thought. Think carefully before you lash out at someone.

"
4171,6 october 2018,virgo,"The Moon is in your sign this weekend, which should  put a smile on your face. But other people may be talking in circles, and your frustration could be rising. If need be, go solo. Just worry about yourself and your own happiness. Everyone else can wait.

"
4172,7 october 2018,virgo,"Opposites attract, but do they always get along? Pay attention if you feel as though you have to change who you are in order to get along with someone. It may not be worth it.

"
4173,8 october 2018,virgo,"Don’t jump in where angels fear to tread, Virgo. Today’s new Moon occurs in your income sector, encouraging you to pulling more cash. But a tough Uranus aspect warns against doing anything too risky. Vet new opportunities carefully and take your time before you dive in.

"
4174,9 october 2018,virgo,"The next three weeks are excellent for self promotion, thanks to Mercury entering your communications sector. Yesterday’s new Moon was in your income house, so now’s the time to talk yourself up. The rest of October is also excellent for communicating with loved ones. Looking for love? You can find it right in your own backyard.

"
4175,10 october 2018,virgo,"“Why am I surrounded by idiots?”   That thought may enter your mind as people spout stupid opinions and come up with totally unrealistic plans. Trying to make progress on group efforts will be difficult, so don’t waste your breath. Wait for tomorrow when the aspects are better for talking sense to others.

"
4176,11 october 2018,virgo,"Let your passion show today, Virgo. Whether it’s your love for another person or a pet….or a hobby that inspires you…or a career that makes your heart sing. Pull away from work and your responsibilities, and just enjoy life a little.

"
4177,12 october 2018,virgo,"Try to be a little more flexible when it comes to dealing with your nearest and dearest. If you hit them up with too many rules or expectations, you run the risk of coming off like a tyrant….even if you feel as though you’re 100% justified.

"
4178,13 october 2018,virgo,"You can sit around and pine for the good old days when things were better, but what’s the point? You can’t get that time back. And the planets are moving into a fun, social spot tomorrow and in the early part of the week. So focus on enjoying life today.

"
4179,14 october 2018,virgo,"Looking for the real deal in love? This week is well aspected for matters of the heart, starting today. Mature Saturn is trying to help you develop a strong bond with someone….whether you’re already attached or not! Singles, Friday the 19th and the weekend that follows is super for tracking down a keeper.

"
4180,15 october 2018,virgo,"A light touch will go further than a heavy handed one, Virgo. Whether you’re promoting your brand, asking someone for a favor or talking to a lover, easy does it. This coming Friday is also a wonderful time for communicating and gaining cooperation.

"
4181,16 october 2018,virgo,"Creativity is a gift that we humans have been given. So how come you’re not digging into your well of talent enough? A Moon-Pluto aspect is perfect for exploring new ways of expressing yourself. Over the next five weeks you could be surprised at what pours out of you!

4182,17 october 2018,virgo,"You’re not one to step away from hard work. And now that the Moon is in your house of efficiency, it’s all systems go. Don’t be surprised if others witness your can-do spirit and want to partner with you! People know a winner when they see one.

"
4183,18 october 2018,virgo,"There are only 24 hours in a day, so think twice before you take on any more responsibilities. The problem is that red hot Mars is blazing through your productivity zone, making you think that you can do it all. Slow down and reconsider your options.

"
4184,19 october 2018,virgo,"Passion can flow today and so can words of love and encouragement. A lovely Neptune-Mercury trine is perfect for digging deep into your well of emotion. But talking about practical details? Not so much! So forget about the small stuff, and focus on the sweeter side of life instead.

"
4185,20 october 2018,virgo,"“Can’t you see, baby you and me, we got a groovy kind of love!” Those are lines from an old song by The Turtles back in the 1960s. Love could certainly get groovy today, thanks to a passionate embrace between the Moon and Neptune. Take this energy and run with it! And if you’re looking for love, next week has some awesome aspects virtually every day.

"
4186,21 october 2018,virgo,"Romance could take a nice turn over the next few days, Virgo! Abundant Jupiter is in a good mood in your house of communication, allowing you to express your desires and affection. If you’re single, the best place to meet someone new is right in your neighborhood. And the best part is that this energy continues on for another month.

"
4187,22 october 2018,virgo,"If you need to make some tweaks to your life, try more creative approach. Doing things the same old way is just going to bring you more of the same old stuff. You’re ready for some fresh beginnings, so open up your mind to new possibilities.

"
4188,23 october 2018,virgo,"Feeling more talkative? Willing to put yourself out on a limb and express yourself fully? It’s not surprising. The Sun has just entered your house of communicating.

"
4189,24 october 2018,virgo,"It’s time to bring closure to some of your biggest, most audacious plans. The full moon in Taurus is your annual opportunity to make things happen that are BIG: a trip around the world, say, or going to medical school. Writing that book. Starting a business. Finding new love. If you need advice don’t be afraid to seek it.

"
4190,25 october 2018,virgo,"Your life can really use a creative reboot! A sparkling Moon-Pluto trine will help you get in touch with your dramatic, artistic side (yes, we all have one). Start coloring outside the lines. Take a few risks. And don’t be afraid to let people see the new you!

"
4194,29 october 2018,virgo,"Decisions, decisions! With Lucky Jupiter winking at lively Mercury, you could find yourself in a situation where there are plenty of options. Don’t let anyone pressure you, though, into choosing one. Make your own decisions.

"
4198,2 november 2018,virgo,"You don’t owe anyone anything, so don’t fall victim to guilt trips coming from people close to you. Push them aside and do your own thing this weekend.

"
4247,24 december 2018,virgo,"There could be some confusion today when it comes to family and your lover, as murky Neptune is swirling its mist. It could be minor––like who’s bringing the dessert for tomorrow’s dinner–or more intense (as in, are we getting married, or not?). Let the bigger issues pass.

"
4257,10 march 2018,libra,"Trying to talk sense to people may be a fruitless task, Libra, not only today but into the first half of next week.

Venus is in the house of closure and transition, so move on.

"
4395,29 july 2018,libra,"Even though the Sun just went into your house and friendship, it seems that you may be at odds with people in your world. Perhaps you simply don’t share the same values. Or maybe they are being petty. It’s also quite possible that a certain friendship has run its course. If that’s the case, move on. There are plenty of fresh faces to meet!

"
4396,30 july 2018,libra,"Persistence pays off. So does having good habits and working smart routines. People around you may think that things are happening for you due to luck, but you know better. You know what they say: the harder I work, the “luckier” I get.

"
4397,31 july 2018,libra,"Feeling sexy and healthy again is possible, thanks to a helpful Neptune aspect. The next 48 hours are well suited for hunting down a new diet and exercise program. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to look fabulous in a bathing suit…or naked, for that matter!

"
4398,1 august 2018,libra,"Ouch! People could be quite volatile thanks to today’s Mars-Uranus square. This includes you, my friend. With these two planets at odds with each other, tempers will flare. If you don’t want to get caught in the crossfire, avoid people whom you know you’ll have issues with.

"
4399,2 august 2018,libra,"Opposites attract, and sometimes they can even get on the same page. Working out differences with someone close is possible today. Open up the lines of communication and get it all out there on the table.

"
4400,3 august 2018,libra,"With the Moon in the most emotional part of your chart, it would be easy to get flustered over something someone says or does. Chances are you’re just being sensitive. When Venus enters Libra next Monday, the world is going to see like a sunnier place.

"
4401,4 august 2018,libra,"Sometimes our romances can get a little… dull. Which is why the cosmos likes to send us curve balls that will enable us to liven things up! Today is the perfect time to surprise your sweetie with some kind of amorous adventure. If you’re single, try looking for new love in places that you normally would not have considered.

"
4402,5 august 2018,libra,"It seems like a lot more teamwork is needed, especially around the house. With clever Mercury in your house of camaraderie, it’s time to rally the troops. Otherwise you’ll get stuck doing all the grunt work!

"
4403,6 august 2018,libra,"Yeah, baby! Love planet Venus is now in Libra. Not only can you enjoy it more romantic moments, your charisma will be on the rise too. But be selective about the company you keep. You run the risk of drawing in fake friends or people who are working their own agenda.

"
4404,7 august 2018,libra,"Uranus is the planet of constant upheaval, and it has been situated in one of the most emotional parts of your chart for the past few months. Naturally this could have stirred up your feelings. The good news is that today it goes retrograde, giving you the time and space to process them.

"
4405,9 august 2018,libra,"From your chart, it appears that some long-term decisions need to be made. This is especially true when it comes to your residence, family or romantic relationship. But with gentle Venus in your sign, you may be reluctant to make the hard choices. Saturday’s solar eclipse will give you just the boost you need.

"
4406,10 august 2018,libra,"Steer clear of button pushers today, Libra. This is especially true on social media or in texts and emails. Also, watch what you put in writing. Just because of these outlets exist doesn’t mean that you should use them for venting.

"
4407,11 august 2018,libra,"Ready to make some new contacts? I sure hope so, because today’s solar eclipse occurs in the networking part of your chart. You could be asked to join a new team or make some fabulous new friends. The key is to make sure that they share the same values as you. Being selective is not snooty; it’s smart.

"
4408,12 august 2018,libra,"It’s time to get your house in order–both literally and figuratively. Mars is spinning backwards into your domestic sector, highlighting the need to turn your house into a true home. This may simply means organizing or decorating. But it could also mean dealing with family issues that need to finally be put to rest.

"
4409,13 august 2018,libra,"People at work or home may be way too interested in dumping their responsibilities on others. Don’t fall for their tales of woe, or their promises to get it done “later”. Does this mean you should do their grunt work? Hell no! Just be aware that this cosmic energy is at play today.

"
4410,14 august 2018,libra,"Cut yourself a break, Libra. It’s time to go a bit easier on yourself. You’ve been pushing hard, maybe a little bit too hard. A meeting today between the nurturing Moon and gentle Venus in your sign is just the ticket for some extreme self-care.

"
4414,18 august 2018,libra,"With magnetic Venus in your sign, you are attracting a lot of people your way. Don’t be surprised if people want to become your friend, or join the team that you’re on. Also don’t be surprised if a “friend” wants to be more than that…..like your lover?

"
4415,19 august 2018,libra,"Your social life will pick up steam now that Mercury has gone direct in your house of friendships and networking.

"
4417,21 august 2018,libra,"You may need to set boundaries with family members. This includes anyone who lives under your roof too, such as a roommate, your kids or a lover. These people need to start taking you more seriously, Libra. If you don’t take care of things now you run the risk of becoming resentful.

"
4418,22 august 2018,libra,"You’re not a kid anymore. So why are old childhood dramas popping up in your mind? It’s because the Moon and Pluto are stirring up the waters of your subconscious mind, in the house that deals with family.

"
4419,23 august 2018,libra,"The Sun glides into Virgo, the most secretive and confidential part of your chart. Over the next four weeks you could be looking into things without making too much noise about it. Like: searching for a new job, or scoping out a place to live. Researching a business opportunity, such as a home based business. Getting involved with someone romantically….and below the radar Sshhh!!!

"
4420,24 august 2018,libra,"Domestic matters develop momentum as the Moon and Mars meet up in this part of your chart. But emotions could bubble over and things could get heated, so tread carefully. That said, it’s a good time to find a place to live, settle a family argument or work things out with a lover.

"
4421,25 august 2018,libra,"Deepening your bonds with people who count can happen this weekend, Libra. With the Sun in the most cathartic part of your chart you should be able to see their side of things, and to open up and express your own feelings.

"
4422,26 august 2018,libra,"Is everyone in your world acting like a team player? If not, tonight’s full moon could be the final straw for you. You weren’t put on this planet to be the cleanup crew for everyone, or the grunt who knows how to get things done. Demand respect and that others do their fair share.

"
4423,27 august 2018,libra,"You’re currently in a position where you have to operate with your heart just as much as your head. Fortunately, Mars is now direct in your emotional house of domestic matters, so you shouldn’t be dealing with as much family drama as you had been recently. You may have to put people on notice that you’re not going to take their flak, but so be it.

"
4424,28 august 2018,libra,"No matter how much common sense you have, and how solid your advice may be, it doesn’t mean that others will be able to “get it”. You can either get aggravated about this or let it go. Sometimes you just have to let people make their own mistakes.

"
4425,29 august 2018,libra,"It’s time to branch out and expand your contact list, whether that means making new friends, industry contacts or joining a volunteer organization. From your chart it appears that you’ve become complacent, hanging out with the same tribe. There’s nothing wrong with that, but new acquaintances can open your eyes to a different way of living.

"
4426,30 august 2018,libra,"Putting your feelings into words could be a challenge. The emotional Moon is in a kerfuffle with Venus, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t make progress. They say that actions speak louder than words, so let your actions do all of the talking today.

"
4429,2 september 2018,libra,"It’s time to speak from the heart and express your grandest ideas while you’re at it. This is no time for hiding along the sidelines. Your confidence and ability to cooperate with others will show.

Now that Saturn has gone direct in your house of comfort and domesticity, it’s time to let people know that you’re not willing to put up with chaos. This is especially true in your home environment. Set boundaries if you need to.

"
4434,7 september 2018,libra,"You may have an “aha” moment today, Libra! This is a healing aspect, designed to help you release buried emotions that may have been troubling you. Catharsis can happen much more rapidly than you may have expected. Embrace it.

"

"
4436,9 september 2018,libra,"The new Moon in Virgo is encouraging you to go within. If you’ve been thinking about starting a meditation practice, now is the time.

"
4437,10 september 2018,libra,"Lusty Mars barrels into your house of romance, setting the stage for flirting and sizzling date nights.

"
4438,11 september 2018,libra,"Things that you thought were problems may start to disappear over the next 48 hours. It’s not necessarily that the people or circumstances involved will go away.

"
4439,12 september 2018,libra,"It’s all about serenity, comfort and building a strong foundation today. You need to experience all of these in love, your finances and your career. Family matters need to simmer down also. While there are excellent aspects at play which will enable you to do this, maverick Uranus is acting up. Don’t allow other people–– – or your own emotions–– – to upset the apple cart.

"
4440,13 september 2018,libra,"Why am I surrounded by idiots? That may be your battle cry today. Coworkers, customer service people, strangers on the street or the subway…they could all have their heads up their rear ends. You can choose to get annoyed about it, or choose to ignore it. I suggest the latter.

"

"
4444,17 september 2018,libra,"A friend or family member may need a shoulder to cry on, Libra. By all means be there for them, but don’t become a dumping ground. You also may have to point out the facts of life to them. It’s possible that they may need to grow up.

"
4445,18 september 2018,libra,"Don’t be so emo! Repeat this to yourself about 100 times today. The two most hotheaded planets in the solar system, Mars and Uranus, are at each others throats.

"
4461,5 october 2018,libra,"What many people don’t know is that romantic Venus also governs $$$ (hey, they don’t call her a “golden girl” for nothing).

4531,16 december 2018,libra,"People need to know that you mean business, Libra. And setting boundaries is a good place to start. If people don’t recognize that you have your limits, they will pushes hard as they can…and you’ll end up getting annoyed and resentful in the long run.

"

"
4538,23 december 2018,libra,"Sometimes our path in life is hidden by so many layers that we can’t see what’s ahead. But in the next week or so, you should be able to make some sense out of what’s going on. It could be an “aha!” moment or something that slowly reveals itself. But either way, you will have clarity.

"
4539,24 december 2018,libra,"Leave extra time today to get things done, especially if you’re counting on other people to help. They might flake out and forget to do things. Or they may simply slack off. Either way, you’ll need a buffer zone.

"
4540,25 december 2018,libra,"Merry Christmas, Libra! The Moon is in Leo, your eleventh house of friends and camaraderie. Christmas is family time of course, but in your case you should schedule some down time with the tribe. The weekend is perfect for hanging out with friends and  a lover.

With the Moon meeting up with motivator Mars in your income sector, you are more than ready to start earning more cash. But don’t forget that Jupiter is now retrograde in your sign, indicating that you may change your plans over the next few months.

"
4551,10 march 2018,scorpio,"Don’t be shy about asking others to pitch in and help, Scorpio. You weren’t put on this planet to be someone’s maid. If others even think of making excuses or try to guilt you, let ‘em have it. Then hand them the mop, food shopping list or work assignment and tell them to get off their sorry a**.

"
4552,11 march 2018,scorpio,"It may be time to reconsider how you communicate with others, Scorpio. The same old way of talking to your kids, or writing term papers, or negotiating a deal may not be working. Whether you’re the type who withholds information or screams and yells, it’s time for an upgrade.

"
4553,12 march 2018,scorpio,"You’re beginning to realize how limitless you truly are as the Sun ramps up your creativity and optimism. Avoid trolls and others who say that “it can’t be done”. It can  be done; they’re just too blind or lazy to see it.
 
 

"
4554,13 march 2018,scorpio,"Bending the rules may seem like a good plan, but other people may not agree.

"
4555,14 march 2018,scorpio,"Acting like a stubborn four-year old won’t get you anywhere today, so watch out for the tendency to sulk or vent. Once outspoken Mars rolls into your communication sector on Saturday, then  you can mouth off. Although you might be over it by then!

"
4556,15 march 2018,scorpio,"You may need to dole out some tough love to people in your world, Scorpio. This holds true for kids and a lover, but also people you work with. There may be some good old “creative differences” (as they say in Hollywood) at the office. Everyone needs to get on the same page, especially before you sign deals or make big presentations.

"
4557,16 march 2018,scorpio,"Grrrrr!!! Your sign is famous for its sexuality, and today’s a good day to work it. A luscious Moon-Neptune aspect is just the ticket for anything from flirting to downright seduction. Work and tasks can wait for another day.

"
4559,18 march 2018,scorpio,"The recent new moon on Saturday occurred in your house of romance, opening up doors for more fun and love to come your way. So why do you feel like you don’t deserve it? Chiron, the wounded healer, is active, that’s why. Let these silly notions go.

"
4560,19 march 2018,scorpio,"It may be a Monday but the cosmos doesn’t care. A happy Mercury-Venus aspect tells you to flirt, have fun, go out for cocktails or take in a movie. Feel like calling in sick? Why not!

"
4562,21 march 2018,scorpio,"You may feel a bit sluggish over the next few weeks, so protect your health. Get plenty of sleep, nutritious food and aerobic exercise. If you’re dealing with issues that might require a doctor or physical therapist, make those appointments now. The full moon on the 31st is the best time all year to put an end to aches and pains.

"
4563,22 march 2018,scorpio,"Being organized and on top of things could be a challenge over the next few weeks! Mercury just went retrograde in your house of efficiency. Create to-do lists instead of going from memory. Pay attention to habits or systems that simply aren’t working. Back up data and don’t leave flash drives laying around.

"
4564,23 march 2018,scorpio,"If you’re not careful, Scorpio, co-workers and family members will be more than happy to dump their work on your tired shoulders. And they could be pretty brazen or forceful about it too! This is not the time to give in. If you do, you’ll become their go-to maid for the next ten days.

"
4565,24 march 2018,scorpio,"Don’t jump in to something too quickly without performing due diligence, Scorpio. Mars is making you antsy to get moving with plans but in your haste you could overlook important details. Keep this in mind over the next week.

"
4566,25 march 2018,scorpio,"Jupiter may be retrograde in your sign but that doesn’t mean that you should be hiding in a bunker somewhere. On the contrary! A spunky Moon-Jupiter connection urges you to consider some new adventures, which I’m sure your creative mind is capable of.

"
4567,26 march 2018,scorpio,"Getting people to agree on a work project, or to go along with a particular goal of yours, may be difficult today. Save your breath! Things improve tomorrow and get even better on Wednesday.

"
4568,27 march 2018,scorpio,"What seems like a setback today may not be one by tomorrow. With so much planetary activity in your achievement zone, you’re anxious to get moving, but temporary slowdowns give you the chance to reexamine what you’re working on.

"
4569,28 march 2018,scorpio,"The sudden desire to become healthy, fit and sexier could hit you today, and if you’re smart you’ll run with it! This is the best time in 2018 for Scorpios to eat more nutritious foods, take up a new sport and get more shuteye. Not only will you have more energy, your brain will become sharper too.

"
4570,29 march 2018,scorpio,"Paralysis by analysis could occur as you start to obsess over details. Sure, you need to do things right, but at some point you have to get moving. And if creating a few rules would actually help you make progress, then think differently!

"
4571,30 march 2018,scorpio,"Patience is a virtue, something that my grandma used to tell me all the time. And that’s what the cosmos is telling you today, Scorpio! This is especially true with a lover or child. Tomorrow’s full moon could provide you with insight that you need.

"
4573,1 april 2018,scorpio,"Bad habits need to go, Scorpio. So do inefficient systems, lazy employees and anything or anyone that wastes your time. Speak your piece today and tomorrow while the aspects are good. But from Wednesday on, say little.

"
4574,2 april 2018,scorpio,"Once those words leave your mouth you can never take them back. The same goes for texts and e-mails. With pushy Mars eager to vent, you run the risk of saying too much too soon. Slow down and consider the consequences of your communications.

"
4575,3 april 2018,scorpio,"You may feel as though you have all the answers but if you’re smart you’ll seek someone’s opinion. They may be able to help you dig deeper into an issue and come up with better intel or solutions.

"
4576,4 april 2018,scorpio,"Ouch! Watch the tendency to come off as being too opinionated or aggressive today, quite a possibility with Mars in a feisty mood. Cooperation with others does  count. Don’t come off as you’re looking out for #1–even if you are!

"
4577,5 april 2018,scorpio,"Don’t be so tough on yourself. Stern Saturn is pushing you to create better ways of going about things but you’re not going to get it right every time. Practice makes perfect.

"
4581,9 april 2018,scorpio,"Avoid petty arguments if you can; they’re simply not worth it today. People may be acting unreasonable and you don’t have to be like Pavlov’s dog. Responding will only pull you in deeper.

"
4582,10 april 2018,scorpio,"Your true path in life is being revealed to you, so if you’re smart you’ll pay attention! This is especially true when it comes to your career. Look out for #1 these days.

People around you may resist your efforts, but that’s their problem.

"
4588,17 april 2018,scorpio,"What you say, how you say it and how your present yourself to the world is about to change, Scorpio. Wise, mature Saturn begins to retrograde in your house of self expression. This is especially fortuitous for anyone who’s developing a brand or who is involved in the arts. They say that appearances are everything; make sure that you come off like a pro.

"
4589,18 april 2018,scorpio,"Slogging through chores or office projects can often seem like a grind, but today you could hit upon a brilliant idea for making them go much more quickly.

4591,20 april 2018,scorpio,"The “rules” of your closest relationships are about to undergo change, Scorpio. Now that the Sun is in Taurus, your house of diplomacy and commitment, you should be considering the ways that you relate to others. Do you need to be more present and spend quality time with your tribe? Or do you need to step away from being an enabler, the peace maker, the go-to person who’s always doing the grunt work? Reflect on this and make the appropriate changes.

"
4592,21 april 2018,scorpio,"A message the cosmos is sending your way is that you must be more circumspect about the information that you put out there. It could be your opinion, resume, text messages, term papers or business plan. It could be what you say and how you say it. There is no need to reveal everything, and that which is revealed needs to be on point.

"
4593,22 april 2018,scorpio,"So much is being said about people developing their “brand” that the term is becoming meaningless. Seriously, does everyone have to be a walking billboard, advertising their bad self? Not you, that’s for sure. Now that Pluto has gone retrograde in your house of self expression it’s all about being authentic. But first you need to uncover what “authentic” means to you.

"
4594,23 april 2018,scorpio,"Refining the way you come across in business situations is important right now., Scorpio. You want people to only see the best you have to offer. As a result this may mean handling crises more calmly, polishing up your negotiating skills or updating your website and marketing materials.

"
4595,24 april 2018,scorpio,"Grrrrr!!!! Romantic Venus glides into your house of intimacy and sex, settling in for an amorous three week stay. You might be feeling a bit selfish in the love department these days as next week’s full moon occurs in your sign. If a lover isn’t giving you what you need, maybe it’s time to move on!

"
4596,25 april 2018,scorpio,"People around you may be hell bent on following the same old procedures or sticking with the same old tired ideas. You, on the other hand, seem to be full of smart efficiency hacks and concepts. Your ideas will fall on deaf ears so don’t waste your time. Tomorrow is a better time to get your point across.

"
4597,26 april 2018,scorpio,"You could end up being quite forceful today with your words….which could be a good thing or a bad thing. Aggressive Mars and powerful Pluto meet up in the heavens, either turning you into a tyrant or a silver tongued persuader. Make sure that you choose wisely.

"
4598,27 april 2018,scorpio,"Your common sense is telling you one thing, and your emotions another. Which one to go with? I’d say to go the rational route. The Moon is in a wonky angle, creating fears, drama and “gut feelings” that are off base.

"
4599,28 april 2018,scorpio,"If you’re not sure of the facts, don’t say anything. Got an outrageous opinion? Keep it to yourself. A Moon-Mars square warns against being too vocal. This includes bright ideas, too. You’re much better off keeping them to yourself, at least for the next week.

"
4600,29 april 2018,scorpio,"Anyone who thinks that you’re a pushover is in for a big surprise, Scorpio! These days you really  mean business, and you’re not afraid to let that fact be known. If you need to set boundaries, put people in their place or go public with something that has been bothering you, now’s the time to do it.

"
4601,30 april 2018,scorpio,"Once a year everyone gets to enjoy a full moon in their sign, and tonight’s your night! This lunation is extra special as amorous Neptune is in a fabulous angle from your house of love, flirting and having fun. Abundant Jupiter is also well aspected, putting you in the spotlight. Now’s the time to get your name and ideas out there.

"
4602,1 may 2018,scorpio,"The full moon in your sign yesterday was full of creativity, fun and self-expression. The next two weeks could see you doing a lot more socializing, flirting and developing your talents. But Uranus is in a cranky mood from your efficiency sector, warning that you’d better not forget to get the grunt work done.

"
4603,2 may 2018,scorpio,"You could become easily offended today by something that a person says or does, and your emotional state might be funky for the rest of the day. A Moon-Saturn conjunction tomorrow is a better time to put others on notice that you aren’t allowing chaos and drama into your life.

"
4604,3 may 2018,scorpio,"If you feel as though your business needs to be rebranded, or that your personal look could be updated, now’s a good time to consider fresh options. Jupiter, planet of abundance, is retrograde in your sign, which is actually a perfect aspect for creating changes.

"
4605,4 may 2018,scorpio,"It is time for a change, and the only way it’s going to happen is if you seize the reins. Stop waiting for a white knight to ride in on a horse: it ain’t gonna happen. Fortunately planets in your strategizing sector are active, so figure out what needs to be done and get to it.

"
4606,5 may 2018,scorpio,"Read between the lines! Don’t take everything you hear at face value, Scorpio. There are things going on behind the scenes that you need to ferret out. Fortunately detective-like Pluto is working the case with you.

"
4607,6 may 2018,scorpio,"Who says that dreamers are fools? With Neptune active in your house of creativity and romance, your day dreams can manifest into something quite juicy and exciting. You’ve never been one to run away from passion, art or showing off your talents. Dive in, Scorpio.

"
4608,7 may 2018,scorpio,"Someone may be forceful with their words today, not operating with logic but with uppity attitude. Avoid getting pulled into a battle with them as there will be no satisfaction in it. Might doesn’t make right.

"
4609,8 may 2018,scorpio,"Lucky Jupiter is in your sign, but one of the downsides is that it can make you feel as though you’re a one-person force of nature. The reality is that you need the cooperation, approval or backing of other people. Next week’s new moon in your partnership zone will help you get along with folks who can help you on your journey.

"
4610,9 may 2018,scorpio,"The lines of communication open up nicely today, especially with loved ones. You’ll be able to get your point across with strength, humor and caring. It’s also a winner for exploring your creative talentS and letting them shine.

"
4611,10 may 2018,scorpio,"You’ve got talent, Scorpio—why not really tap into it? Once Uranus moves into Taurus next week, partnering with others will one of the best ways to showcase your goods all the way into 2026.

"
4612,11 may 2018,scorpio,"When Uranus moves into your highly collaborative seventh house next week, your best work will be with partners—all the way through 2026! But you can get a jump start on things today by opening up the lines of communication. This includes lovers too, so air your feelings and opinions.

"
4613,12 may 2018,scorpio,"Haste makes waste, Scorpio. Your grandma may have told you that in the past but today the cosmos is on your case about it. The faster you try to get something don’t, the more screw-ups there will be. Take your time and do things the right way.

"
4614,13 may 2018,scorpio,"Don’t hold back! Megamouth Mercury is now in a sector that deals with some of your deepest thoughts and emotions. You’ll be able to express yourself logically without a lot of drama and finger pointing. The next eight years of your life will be the most cathartic ever, so take that risk and speak up.

"
4615,14 may 2018,scorpio,"The cosmos gives you one last push to get organized and streamline your life. Brilliant Uranus has been in this sector for the past eight years, but it moves on tomorrow to a new locale. Create some solid new habits that will help you get things done more quickly and serenely.

"
4616,15 may 2018,scorpio,"If you think you knew your lover, guess again. If you’re single and think you know what you want from a suitor, your ideas may change radically. Unpredictable Uranus is now in your commitment sector, bringing serendipity and more open-minded thinking when it comes to matters of the heart. A lover could shock you, thrill you or exasperate you… all the way into 2026!

"
4617,16 may 2018,scorpio,"Your personal life is about to become all warm and fuzzy, Scorpio. A new moon just occurred in your commitment house and tomorrow Mars starts touring your home and family sector.

"
4618,17 may 2018,scorpio,"Things could get heated within a business or personal relationship—and you could react angrily. Hot headed Mars is in your house of contentment, which is already a mismatch. So if someone pushes your buttons you might fly off the handle. This battle isn’t worth it, so walk away.

"
4619,18 may 2018,scorpio,"Perfect day to express what’s on your mind, whether it’s in a business setting or a personal one. The two most logical and direct planets, Mercury and Saturn, are aligned so that you can present yourself and your ideas with a calm power.

"
4620,19 may 2018,scorpio,"If you’ve been feeling boxed in lately—by work stress, family demands, health issues or anything else—that’s about to change. Venus has just entered your house of freedom, optimism and breaking the rules. Venus isn’t a rebel; she does things quietly, elegantly. And so can you.

"
4621,20 may 2018,scorpio,"Oh yeah! Scorpios are known for their sexy demeanor and today the Sun enters your house of libido and intimacy. (Funny, I don’t hear any of you complaining.) The next four weeks ought to be pretty interesting considering that amorous Venus entered your house of adventure yesterday. Have fun.

"
4622,21 may 2018,scorpio,"Sometimes ya just gotta let other people know who’s boss, Scorpio….and today is one of those days!  The good news is that you’ll be able to assert a quiet, calm authority without resorting to tyrannical tactics. Your word is your bond and others sense this.

"
4623,22 may 2018,scorpio,"There’s no holding back your feelings today, so let ‘em out! Whether they will be well received is another issue, but keeping things in isn’t healthy. People need to know where you’re coming from and what you expect.

"
4624,23 may 2018,scorpio,"Someone close might accuse you of having your head in the clouds, and the problem is—they may be right! Sunny Jupiter in your sign is filling your brain with rainbows, unicorns, puppies and angels. So if someone tells you to get a grip, they’re on to something.

"
4625,24 may 2018,scorpio,"A happy Sun-Mars trine makes this one of the best days in 2018 to speak from the heart. Take care of problems within your family or romantic relationship. Make serious plans for the future. Real estate matters are well aspected, so if you’re looking to move or remodel, start making plans now.

"
4626,25 may 2018,scorpio,"Creativity, charisma, connecting—all of these get a huge boost from today’s beyond fabulous Jupiter-Neptune trine! These two planets rarely form this angle, so work it, honey. If you feel like creating a brand new look and attitude, do so—and expect results by August 19th, at which time this aspect happens again!

"
4627,26 may 2018,scorpio,"You’re in no mood these days for people verbally abusing you or playing games. Fortunately the two most powerful planets in the solar system, Pluto and Saturn, are in an excellent spot in your house of self expression. Which means that you shouldn’t suffer in silence! Calmly state your case and tell malcontents to back off.

"
4628,27 may 2018,scorpio,"Breaking the rules could create problems that you don’t want to have to deal with, Scorpio. Your secretive sign is masterful at pulling things off without others knowing, but a stern Saturn-Venus opposition warns against doing so over the next 48 hours.

"
4629,28 may 2018,scorpio,"Financial projections need to be rock solid, Libra. Don’t make important fiscal decisions based on emotions or airy-fairy thoughts about what you’d like  to see happen. Tomorrow’s full moon in Sagittarius will shed light on things, and since Sagittarius is your house of brainstorming and negotiating, you’ll be in a good place to move forward.

"
4630,29 may 2018,scorpio,"In astrology there are two houses that govern money, and today you have action in both! The full moon occurs in your income sector just as shrewd Mercury zips into the wealth building one. The next few months are well aspected for finding a new job, starting a business and making wise investment decisions.

"
4631,30 may 2018,scorpio,"Practicality reigns, thanks to the energy of yesterday’s full moon in the stability-seeking part of your chart. Other people may result to drama, guilt trips or passive-aggressive behavior in order to derail you. I wish them a lot of luck….it ain’t happenin’.

"
4632,31 may 2018,scorpio,"The time is right for saying what’s on your mind, Scorpio. You tend to hold things in, making people sweat as they try to decipher what’s going on in that brain of yours. But with chill Saturn putting the right words in your mouth, don’t hold back.

"
4633,1 june 2018,scorpio,"If you have something to say to a lover, family member or roommate, now’s the time! A wonderful Mercury aspect allows you to open up and get your feelings out. You’ve grown tired of shaky situations and drama. If you want to create more stability in your life, you have to let others know that.

"
4634,2 june 2018,scorpio,"Knowing what you want is half the battle, Scorpio! Some highly optimistic cosmic energy is opening your eyes to a plethora of goodies to chase after. Be decisive and narrow down your focus.

"
4635,3 june 2018,scorpio,"Your sign is famous for being able to hide your true feelings and thoughts, but that just isn’t going to happen today! An energetic and passionate Moon-Mars connection is going to make you spill, but this is a good thing. Other people need to know where you stand. They’re not mind readers, you know.

"
4636,4 june 2018,scorpio,"Shaking yourself loose of negative juju is a lot easier when the illuminating Sun and common sense Mercury are on the case. Conveniently, they are in a good spot to help you today as they form a perfect line in the heavens. Drama and chaos are going to start looking a lot less attractive.

"
4637,5 june 2018,scorpio,"This is not a good day to try to break the rules, Scorpio. Make sure that everything you say and do is right on point, faultless. This is especially true about the written word. Mercury isn’t retrograde but tyrannical Pluto is on the warpath in your house of communicating.

"
4638,6 june 2018,scorpio,"It could be hard to get a straight answer from someone close, and this could fray your nerves. You seem to be coming from a pretty logical place thanks to hosting the Sun and Mercury in your house of emotions. But others may be in full drama/diva mode, so put on your seatbelt!

"
4639,7 june 2018,scorpio,"Beware the green-eyed monster, whether it resides in you or has taken over someone else! Jealousy ain’t pretty, my friend.

"
4640,8 june 2018,scorpio,"With the Moon in the sportiest part of your chart you should be getting off the sofa this weekend and getting into action. This is an auspicious time to start a diet or make a vow to get more sleep. With next week’s new moon occurring in your house of sex, now you have you yet another reason for getting toned!

"
4641,9 june 2018,scorpio,"Don’t kid yourself about discipline. Scorpio. The word conjures up images of hard work and denial, but sticking to a plan yields results! The ancient Taoists and Buddhists called this “process”: sticking to a routine, accepting the boredom of it, and then happily patting yourself on the back in the end.

"
4642,10 june 2018,scorpio,"It may have been a bit confusing lately to sort out the truth from the BS, but things are starting to turn around. Looking at the sunnier side of life becomes more easy once Mercury enters Cancer on Tuesday. Your confidence will rise and the murkiness other people are putting out won’t bother you as much.

"
4643,11 june 2018,scorpio,"If anyone even suggests that you can’t do something–or that your ideas are crazy–feel free to hand them a ration of whoop-ass, Scorpio! The planets are lining up later this week to take you into exciting, unchartered territory. You don’t need any anchor-like people holding you down.

"
4644,12 june 2018,scorpio,"Taking calculated risks is in the stars for you, Scorpio! Today Mercury glides into your house of advanced thought, and tomorrow Venus enters your house of ambition. Everything is lining up nicely for you to score in two big life areas: romance and net worth.

"
4645,13 june 2018,scorpio,"Your sign is famous for its passion and sexuality, and today is your annual new moon in the house of libido! The next few months could be quite passionate, but without drama, jealousy and other nonsense. That’s because amorous Venus enters your house of stability and tradition today also. Buh bye, bad boys and divas.

"
4646,14 june 2018,scorpio,"Close relationships could get a little testy with a Venus-Uranus square. People may not agree about the long term, or how a certain situation should be handled. This isn’t a deal breaker but it’s important to listen to the other person’s point of view. From your chart it appears that you may be too opinionated over the next few days!

"
4647,15 june 2018,scorpio,"The two most logical planets in the solar system, Mercury and Saturn, are at war with each other. This could create delays in big plans as people may not know which direction to head in. Fortunately this energy changes by Tuesday, at which time you may need to take control and point out the way to everyone else.

"
4648,16 june 2018,scorpio,"An insanely creative period in your life will begin next week, and you may already be feeling it! If you’re an artist naturally this is good news. But everyone needs to tap into their own personal well of talent, whether at work or at home raising your kids. You will be pushed past previously held personal notions of what you were capable of. Bravo!

"
4649,17 june 2018,scorpio,"People may be interested in giving you advice, telling you to change your life this way and that. They may mean well but the final decision comes down to you. Take the next four weeks to consider your options, then swing into action when Leo season begins in late July.

The next few days are fabulous for growth and expansion, so don’t hide in the shadows. With intelligent Mercury in your house of taking risks, you can make progress in areas that may have seemed impossible before.

"
4652,20 june 2018,scorpio,"Your creativity and sense of adventure are on the upswing. This is a good time to study the game book of someone you admire, whether they’re alive or not—the great explorers, artists, scientists, authors and bon vivants. What is about them and their lives that you could emulate? What risks could you take? Once the Sun changes signs tomorrow you should start to incorporate these into your life.

"
4653,21 june 2018,scorpio,"If you feel like flying off into the wild blue yonder, boldly going where no man has gone before (Star Trek!) or launching an entrepreneurial start-up, blame it all on the Sun entering your ninth house of risk taking. You might also try on a new lover for size, write a book or get another college degree. A Venus-Mars opposition indicates that you’re ready to buck convention, so don’t be afraid to show the world some cutting edge ideas.

"
4654,22 june 2018,scorpio,"Your love life gets a boost from spunky Uranus, the planet of serendipity. Try some new adventures when it comes to date nights or traveling on vacation.

"
4655,23 june 2018,scorpio,"Sometimes you just need to keep to the script and not make any big changes, Scorpio. Today is one of those days and so is next Wednesday. Play the game, even if it kills you. Don’t worry. This won’t last long! Within a week’s time you’re back on top again.

"
4656,24 june 2018,scorpio,"It’s always a good thing when the cosmos is telling you to go out and party with your friends, and that’s what you should do today! Spend time with people who share your outlook on life. And there could be some new friends that you’ll make along the way.

"
4657,25 june 2018,scorpio,"This is no time to kid yourself about the direction something is going in, Scorpio. The two most optimistic planets, Venus and Jupiter, are at odds, indicating that you might not be seeing things clearly. This is especially true of major goals or dreams. When Mercury changes signs on Friday clarity will return.

"
4658,26 june 2018,scorpio,"Need a breather from the family unit? That could be the case now that Mars is retrograde in your domestic sector. There is  such a thing as too much togetherness, so if your nerves are frayed by roommates, parents, siblings or a lover, then take some time for yourself.

"
4659,27 june 2018,scorpio,"The words you speak–or write– could have long lasting consequences, so be mindful of what you put out there. Things are heating up in your house of success and you don’t want to blow it!

"
4660,28 june 2018,scorpio,"The full moon could bring about a series of happy events over the next two weeks: meeting someone new, going away on a trip, landing the job or university of your choice, or watching a pet project get the approval it deserves. But make sure that you don’t over extend yourself, a possibility under this aspect.

"
4661,29 june 2018,scorpio,"The Leo time period is the best of the year for your sign to go after big plans and dreams, and it’s three weeks away.

"
4663,1 july 2018,scorpio,"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, so pour on the charm, Scorpio! You’ll still be able to get your way, and the other party will think things are being done their way. The bottom line is that you win.

"
4669,8 july 2018,scorpio,"Sweet! A juicy Sun-Neptune trine is just the ticket for romance. Couples, you should be booking a foreign trip, the more exotic the better.

"
4671,10 july 2018,scorpio,"Finally! Jupiter resumes direct motion in Scorpio today. Plans that may have been on hold can now move forward. Truth is, you may be ready to take some risks. Ditch plans and ideas that may been a little bit too safe, and replace them with dreams that are more audacious.

"

"
4677,16 july 2018,scorpio,"Find a cause that is close to your heart, and commit yourself to it. Ancient astrologers knew that people have charitable hearts; therefore they devoted an entire sector of a person’s chart to giving.

"
4678,17 july 2018,scorpio,"You may have unfinished business to take care of, and if you’re smart you’ll deal with it today.

"
4683,22 july 2018,scorpio,"The Sun is now in Leo, your tenth house of ambition and success. That said, don’t expect fabulous things to happen overnight!

"
4686,25 july 2018,scorpio,"Think twice before you decide to to challenge someone who is in an authority position. You need to have other people backing you up more than you may realize. This is no time to make enemies. Try to be diplomatic, at least on the surface!

"
4690,29 july 2018,scorpio,"Don’t be surprised if people are a little bit critical today. They may have your best wishes at heart, even though their words may be a bit harsh. It’s also possible that you may need to come down hard on someone close. If that’s the case, be as direct as possible. Sugarcoating things won’t help them a bit.

"

Spending some time behind closed doors with a loved one is also in the stars.

"
4699,7 august 2018,scorpio,"A couple of months ago, rebellious Uranus entered your partnership sector. This may have stirred out the desire for more independence within a personal or professional union. Or perhaps you’ve wanted to rewrite the rules of a relationship. Today it goes retrograde, allowing you to do so. All relationships need recalibration from time to time. Now you have the opportunity to do so.

"
4700,9 august 2018,scorpio,"With gentle Venus in your house of fantasy, it may be difficult to separate fact from fiction today. But that’s exactly what you are going to have to do. You’re better off mulling things over rather than speaking your mind, or asking questions. Be observant.The actions of others will speak louder than their words.

"

Whatever you do, don’t stay home!

"
4715,24 august 2018,scorpio,"You could get quite mouthy today, which could be a good thing….or a bad thing! Brazen Mars is acting up in your communication sector, prompting you to express yourself: verbally, in writing or even through the arts. As a result, use care when it comes to self expression. You need to impress people and get along with them, not make enemies.

"
4716,25 august 2018,scorpio,"You’re in an incredibly strategic spot right now, especially when it comes to meeting the “right people”….whatever that means to you! You could bump into your future spouse, join a volunteer group for a cause that’s close to your heart, or connect with industry people who can help take your career to the next level.

Clever Pluto is well aspected to help you take control of the message you’re putting out there. Anyone who’s promoting a brand or creative idea will benefit form this as well.

"
4721,30 august 2018,scorpio,"Venus is gliding through your house of fantasy and the subconscious mind. This isn’t a problem if it results in a few daydreams here and there, but it is an issue if you are veering off into rainbows-and-unicorns land. Try to keep things real.

"
4722,31 august 2018,scorpio,"It’s one thing to be assertive and another to be aggressive. With volatile Uranus active in your chart, you run the risk of mowing people over with too much attitude or demands. Take a few steps back and remember to be polite!

But yesterday’s new moon fell in your house of friends and networking, indicating that you should be enjoying a happy social life as well. Strike a balance. Don’t forget that you need some “me” time also.

"
4733,11 september 2018,scorpio,"Today is one of the best days in 2018 to meet new people and expand your contact list! It’s also well aspected for reaching out to people you already know. On a social level, this could mean friends or people from charity or volunteer work. On a romantic level it could mean a lover… or someone who you have in mind! Industry contacts can play an important role in your career path, so text them or attend a seminar.

"
4734,12 september 2018,scorpio,"The two most generous and optimistic planets, Jupiter and Venus, are active in your sign today. You have so much charisma that it’s almost shameful! On top of that, you also have the gift of gab. That makes today one of the best times in 2018 to make a big ask, get your point across or promote yourself.

"
4735,13 september 2018,scorpio,"You may love someone dearly, but that doesn’t mean that you should put up with their antics.

"
4736,14 september 2018,scorpio,"Watch your tongue today, Scorpio! Aggressive Mars is active in your house of communicating, and you could end up biting someone’s head off. Furthermore, people may be acting erratically, which could push your buttons. Keep calm. Tomorrow is a much better day.

"
4737,15 september 2018,scorpio,"You may need to seize the reins in some kind of family or group activity, but that’s OK. Someone’s gotta do it, and right now you’re the person with the best ideas.

"
4742,20 september 2018,scorpio,"If you need something today, don’t be afraid to ask. Maybe you need a favor. Perhaps you desire someone’s expert opinion. Or maybe you need somebody to lend a hand. Stop trying to do everything yourself.

"
4743,22 september 2018,scorpio,"Having trouble making up your mind? It wouldn’t be surprising under current planetary energy. The Sun has just entered your dreamy, intuitive twelfth house. Yet stern, serious Saturn is telling you to pay attention to the logical left side of your brain. This vibe will continue into next week so don’t even try to make any major decisions!

"
4744,23 september 2018,scorpio,"Your intuition is razor sharp these days, but this doesn’t mean that you should act on it. Let the information flow in. Consider it carefully. You still need more time to make major decisions.

"
4748,28 september 2018,scorpio,"If you’re feeling a little independent these days, don’t be surprised. A Moon-Jupiter opposition is stirring up your desire to do things your way.

"
4749,29 september 2018,scorpio,"Ah, peace at last. A meeting of the emotional Moon and logical Saturn is perfect for balancing out your thoughts and feelings. Your thinking will be clear and you will be able to get your point across with ease and sincerity.

"
4750,30 september 2018,scorpio,"Getting in touch with your deepest desires is easy thanks to a sultry Neptune aspect. This sounds sexual, and yes, you certainly can get in touch with your sexy side. But what else do you desire out of life? More adventure? More peace of mind? Consider all of your options.

"
4751,1 october 2018,scorpio,"This is not a good time to be reckless in your actions or words. Even if your brain is popping out one fantasy after another, the smart thing to do is to act like a conservative bore on the outside! When Venus starts to retrograde on Friday in your sign, you will have several weeks to think things through.

"
4752,2 october 2018,scorpio,"You know that old saying about trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, right? That’s the kind of energy you’re dealing with today. Trying to push things along so that they fit your agenda or timetable is just not going to work.

And today intelligent Mercury enters your sign. Start thinking now about what you’d like to experience in your next birthday year.

"
4760,10 october 2018,scorpio,"You should be feeling good about yourself. Mercury and Venus are both cruising through your sign, dousing you with charisma. So why are people being so freakin’ cranky?

"
4772,23 october 2018,scorpio,"Woo-hoo! The Sun is now in your sign and it’s all about you.  But….maybe it’s too much about you! A difficult Uranus aspect could make you a little pigheaded.

4781,2 november 2018,scorpio,"Separating fact from fiction could be difficult today, not only from others but in your own mind. Your best bet is to wait until Sunday, when the Moon is in the house of intuition. Logical Mercury will also be in a good angle then, allowing for clarity to seep in.

"
4788,10 november 2018,scorpio,"There is no reason to play by the rules! Especially since the rules are always made up by other people. You are your own unique individual, and you don’t need to fit in. There’s nothing wrong with being a true original.

"
4795,17 november 2018,scorpio,"If you want to get somebody’s attention, sometimes it’s better just to whisper. Going loud and proud of is not always the smartest move. Now that Venus is direct in the most secretive part of your chart, you can gain more ground by being subtle.

But long term Saturn is on the job, interested in cementing a serious relationship. Singles, this is a good time to meet someone new.

"
4804,29 november 2018,scorpio,"Get other people to pitch in and help you get a job done, Scorpio. If you’re sitting there saying, “Yeah, right, who the hell is going to help me?” you may be pleasantly surprised. If you don’t ask, you don’t get.

"
4808,3 december 2018,scorpio,"Magnetic Venus is in your sign and this could drum up drama! But make sure it’s the good kind of drama, not the kind of stuff that belongs in a soap opera. You could become quite emotional due to aggressive Mars charging through Pisces.

"
4812,7 december 2018,scorpio,"It’s time to get your money situation squared away. The new moon in Sagittarius is your annual opportunity to start afresh.

"
4824,19 december 2018,scorpio,"Put in extra effort right now if you want to see bigger bucks in 2019. The Sun will only be in your income sector for another few days, and right now is the time to get things started. By Friday of this week you’ll be far more interested in just socializing!

"
4834,29 december 2018,scorpio,"You deserve the best, and you know it! A happy Mars-Moon aspect today tells you to enjoy life to the fullest. It’s not your karma to suffer, babe. Play hard this weekend, because once Mars changes signs on New Year’s Eve you will be in a far more practical mood.

"
4835,30 december 2018,scorpio,"You’re not invincible, Scorpio. Yeah, yeah, we know. Your sign is famous for death and rebirth, as if you can reincarnate any time you damn well please. The cosmos is telling you to slow down and take better care of your health. When Mars enters your house of vitality and fitness tomorrow, you’ll hit the ground running.

"
4839,10 march 2018,sagittarius,"This is not a good day to try to close a romantic “deal”, archer.

Likewise, don’t allow yourself to be manipulated into doing something that you’re not ready to do.

"
4840,11 march 2018,sagittarius,"Life may feel constricting, archer, as stern Saturn squares changeable Mercury. You may feel like busting out of old roles and circumstances. This will be a theme running throughout the week. Tomorrow is a winner for coming up with creative solutions.
 
 

"
4841,12 march 2018,sagittarius,"Your intuition is strong this week, and you also might have memories form the past coming back to you. This is all part of a learning process from the cosmos. Examine these old memories and glean knowledge from them, so you won’t repeat the same mistakes.

"

4846,17 march 2018,sagittarius,"It’s time to get your “house” in order, Sagittarius! This literally means your home, as a new moon occurs in that sector. But you need to get your financial house in order too, which can happen now that Mars is in your house of income, budgeting and saving. Be careful, though—Mars can make you overspend when it’s here, and you need to develop a bigger nest egg.

"
4847,18 march 2018,sagittarius,"It’s not your role in life to play the family consigliere, doormat or enabler. Nor is it your karma to carry around guilt, anger or shame for anything that happened in your childhood. Let it go, as a brighter, happier period is about to begin.

"
4848,19 march 2018,sagittarius,"You’ve spent too many weeks trying to keep other people happy, Sagittarius. The Sun will be moving on tomorrow to a much more festive spot, so get ready to cut loose. Tell people that you’re done taking care of their problems and to take them somewhere else.

4850,21 march 2018,sagittarius,"Your closest connections are under the watchful gaze of the cosmos, archer. Who’s true blue? Do they share the same values as you? The approaching full moon on the 31st could represent a break point with people whom you may have outgrown. That said, some exciting new faces could come into your life.

"
4851,22 march 2018,sagittarius,"Deep emotions could start bubbling to the surface thanks to Mercury going retrograde in your dramatic fifth house.

"
4852,23 march 2018,sagittarius,"From your chart it’s clear that you need to get a grip on your finances, but there could be factors getting in the way. Maybe it’s your own desire to spend on swag and fun. Perhaps it’s a child who’s guilting you into buying expensive new kicks or tech gadgets. A lover might be more interested in spending than saving. You need to pull it together, stat.

"
4853,24 march 2018,sagittarius,"It’s your emotions versus logic as Mars battles it out with the Sun. This duel could be raging in your own head or between you and somebody else. The next week could be a bumpy road with this, so try to keep calm and carry on.

"
4858,29 march 2018,sagittarius,"Trying to talk sense into other people isn’t worth it, archer, at least not with today’s cosmic energy. Sometimes people just have to figure things out for themselves. Let them.

"
4859,30 march 2018,sagittarius,"Let others know, without any shadow of a doubt, that you’re not their problem solver. It’s one thing to be of help, but another to get taken advantage of.

"
4863,3 april 2018,sagittarius,"You’re never one to hold back your opinion, and you generally put all of your cards on the table for the world to see. Not today, archer. Keep your thoughts and plans to yourself. Knowledge is power and you need all the power you can get.

"
4864,4 april 2018,sagittarius,"It’s time to get serious about putting more money in your savings account. Spending cash on entertainment, clothing and electronic toys may be tempting, but the planets urge you to be more conservative. And don’t let anyone guilt you into spending either!

"
4871,11 april 2018,sagittarius,"Your sign is optimistic by nature, but sometimes you need to get your feet planted firmly on the ground. If people around you are causing too much drama, or you’re putting them on a pedestal, it’s time to get real. This is especially true within your family or love life. Sometimes “boring” is a good thing.

"
4872,12 april 2018,sagittarius,"Whether you believe in feng shui or not really doesn’t matter. But the planets are  telling you to simplify, simplify, simplify.

4877,18 april 2018,sagittarius,"It’s time to get serious—real  serious—about your finances, archer. Disciplined Saturn begins to retrograde in your house of income and savings, demanding that you get a clear picture of your cash flow. You can earn more if you’re willing to put in the effort. Fortunately the Sun enters your efficiency zone in a few days, turning you into a dynamo.

"
4878,19 april 2018,sagittarius,"Just how much freedom do you need in your closest relationships, archer? Your sign is famous for being independent but under current cosmic conditions, stability is looking more attractive. There is  a way to balance both; you just have to find it.

"
4879,20 april 2018,sagittarius,"“The early bird gets the worm.”  “The harder I work the luckier I get.” Keep these old sayings in mind over the next four weeks because the Sun is now in the most efficient part of your chart. It’s critical to streamline your habits and routines, especially if you want to earn more money. The full moon on the 30th is a perfect time to toss old routines and  replace them with new ones.

"
4880,21 april 2018,sagittarius,"Don’t be so emo! The Moon is stirring up your feelings and you might be tempted to vent, or even worse, lash out. Becoming more discrete is a lesson you’ll be learning in 2018. Find healthier ways to deal with negative emotions, such as journaling, exercise or meditation.

"
4881,22 april 2018,sagittarius,"The planets are encouraging you to gain more control over your financial situation, archer. Pluto, the planet of personal power, begins to retrograde today in your income sector. If you’re not getting paid what you’re worth, or there’s a business idea inside of you that’s dying to come out, start taking action to improve your lot in life.

"
4882,23 april 2018,sagittarius,"Breaking the rules is looking pretty appetizing with a spunky lunar aspect! Of course, this is standard operating procedure for your sign. The good news is that stern, logical Saturn will help you develop some new rules that are well thought out….after you break the others!

"
4883,24 april 2018,sagittarius,"It will pay to be diplomatic over the next few weeks, archer. No matter how badly you may desire to work independently or even pull away from the madding crowd, you still need to act the part of a team player. This will last for about three weeks, so slap a smile on your face and pretend.

"
4884,25 april 2018,sagittarius,"Good luck trying to get your feelings or ideas expressed to people today, be they loved ones or co-workers. People are too wrapped up in their own issues to listen to what you have to say. Sunday and Monday are much better for teamwork and sharing.

"
4885,26 april 2018,sagittarius,"This is one of the best days in 2018 to score bigger bucks thanks to red hot Mars and power broker Pluto meeting up in your income sector. It’s time to take charge of your financial destiny and start living the lifestyle of your choosing. But with a full moon coming in your hush-hush zone on Monday, keep your ideas to yourself.

"
4886,27 april 2018,sagittarius,"Trying to fit in with the crowd is usually not your thing, but today you could feel pressured to blend in. Please. How will this help you? It won’t. FYI, the full moon on Monday falls in your house of secrecy, so if you want to go your own way, make like an Indian tracker who leaves no trail behind him.

"
4887,28 april 2018,sagittarius,"If you’re looking to score a raise, start a business or get a new job, you may want to follow your own inner wisdom rather than relying on someone else’s opinion. It’s helpful to have contacts that can introduce you to the right people, but at the end of the day you need to rely on your own gut feelings.

"
4888,29 april 2018,sagittarius,"Tomorrow’s full moon occurs in a sector that deals with wellness, surgery, nutrition and any modality required to keep you in tip top shape (such as physical therapy). Today a Sun-Saturn trine makes it easy to create new healthy habits and stick with them. It’s the perfect time to end a habit like smoking, or to begin a diet.

"
4889,30 april 2018,sagittarius,"The full moon in Scorpio is all about closing out iffy, unstable situations and replacing them with solid deals (and people) that you can count on. Respecting yourself and not allowing drama and negativity in your life is a critical part of your journey. Get real and make some serious, life-changing decisions.

"
4890,1 may 2018,sagittarius,"The recent full moon in Scorpio fell in your house of closure, healing and transition. The next two weeks are some of the best in 2018 for releasing things that are no longer helping you on your journey. Naturally, this requires a lot of reflection. But Uranus is howling from your house of having fun, demanding that you just chuck the inner work and party. Ask yourself this: which is most important right now?

"
4891,2 may 2018,sagittarius,"With the Moon in your sign it’s only natural that you’re itching to do your own thing. But others may not want to play along, and instead of getting in your face they may resort to passive tactics. That’s OK. You’re going to push forward regardless as to what they say, think or do!

"
4892,3 may 2018,sagittarius,"Holding back is not your usual MO but today you’re advised to be reflective about what you’re doing in life. The full moon on May 29th falls in your sign, making it the best time all year to close things out that aren’t working for you and launch things that are.

"

"

"
4895,6 may 2018,sagittarius,"Is it time for a residential makeover? According to your chart, it is. Whether you want to move to a new place or freshen up your current abode, get moving!

"
4896,7 may 2018,sagittarius,"Loved ones could be difficult to read today, or worse–they could be downright cranky! This might throw you off balance, making you wonder just what the hell is going to happen next. But the bottom line is that tough guy Pluto has your back from the house of stability. Don’t give in or give up.

"
4897,8 may 2018,sagittarius,"Snap out of it! The Sun is going to give you a wakeup call if you’re spending too much time in dreamland. Fantasies and unrealistic thinking could take you down the rabbit hole like Alice in Wonderland. Avoid the mushrooms and drink a strong cup of coffee.

"
4898,9 may 2018,sagittarius,"Shore up whatever resources you need to get something done, archer. Maybe you need more money. Or perhaps you need someone’s support or time. Maybe it’s a quieter mindset that will help you make progress. Whatever it is, find it.

"
4899,10 may 2018,sagittarius,"Aaawwww!! This is one heck of a sentimental day. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself reminiscing about the past. Or you’re digging through old photos. Why not honor your ancestors and deceased pets by creating a little shrine to them at home?

"
4900,11 may 2018,sagittarius,"Get your affairs in order, archer. The two most authoritative planets in the solar system, Pluto and the Sun, are working overtime in the houses of efficiency and income. I don’t need to tell you that money and productivity go hand in hand. You want to see more green? Then get caught up on the old projects first.

"
4901,12 may 2018,sagittarius,"Unless you’re living in a cloister or monastery, we all want the good things in life. Sometimes too much, to the point where we overspend or get annoyed that are lives are not as fabulous as they should be. Watch out for that tendency today, archer. You’re about to enter a highly practical time when doing things methodically will bring see payoffs.

"
4902,13 may 2018,sagittarius,"Feeling friskier than usual? More creative? Interested in jazzing up your life with a new look or attitude? It wouldn’t surprise me.

"
4903,14 may 2018,sagittarius,"You’re entering into an ultra-organized, Martha Stewart kind of lifestyle in which you’ll have a container for every object and a schedule for every day!

Today nimble Mercury zips into this sector, so think about the areas of your life that need some improvement.

"
4904,15 may 2018,sagittarius,"One of the most productive stages of your entire life officially begins today as Uranus rolls into Taurus. Taurus is your house of efficiency, and when this house is lit up we get our acts together. Considering that Uranus is all about cutting edge technology and smart new ideas, you certainly won’t be interested in doing things the old way.

"
4905,16 may 2018,sagittarius,"Uranus moved into your efficiency zone yesterday and things are taking off quickly. A new moon just occurred in the same sector, pushing you to get caught up on unfinished tasks. Once Mars moves into Aquarius tomorrow, a new sense of teamwork starts to build. after all, you  can be super-productive, but you’ll need the help of other people to get things off the ground.

"
4906,17 may 2018,sagittarius,"You’re in an outspoken mood thanks to boisterous Mars in your communication sector. However, there could be unexpected resistance to your ideas or opinions. Don’t expect cooperation today; that may not happen until this weekend! Just stay the course and keep a low profile.

"
4907,18 may 2018,sagittarius,"This is one of the best days in 2018 to reduce clutter, initiate better habits and rationally make plans for the months ahead. This goes for your personal life, health and the way you get things done at the office too. Make a vow to live a more organized life; a lower stress level will be just one of the benefits.

"
4910,21 may 2018,sagittarius,"You’re in a highly practical place these days, but that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have any fun.

"
4911,22 may 2018,sagittarius,"If your home is looking a wee bit drab—or way too cluttered—now’s the time to start cleaning things up and decorating. A helpful Mercury-Neptune aspect is just the ticket for thinking logically and inspirationally at the same time.

"
4912,23 may 2018,sagittarius,"If you feel as though your mind is playing tricks on you, it may be! A wonky Jupiter-Mercury opposition will make it hard to separate fact from fiction. The good news is that the upcoming full moon on the 29th is in your sign, bringing some much needed clarity and decision making.

"
4913,24 may 2018,sagittarius,"Don’t hold back! With chatty Mars in your house of self-expression, it’s a wonderful day to get your message out there, whatever it might be.

People will  take notice.

"
4924,4 june 2018,sagittarius,"From your chart it appears that you really  need to get your point across to people in your world, especially loved ones. While they may be living on Fantasy Island, you sure as hell aren’t. So open up and calmly tell them what’s on your mind. Do it now or regret it later.

"
4925,5 june 2018,sagittarius,"There’s an obsessive vibe in the air due to a tense Venus-Pluto opposition. Don’t get into a mental place in which you’re overanalyzing every single word or gesture someone makes. If someone else is trying to control you, then gently slip out of their grasp.

"
4937,17 june 2018,sagittarius,"People around you–friends, your family–may be all aflutter about something, but you may need to be the rational one in order to calm them down. As usual.

"
4940,20 june 2018,sagittarius,"Sometimes passion and practicality don’t mix—but today they do! So if there’s a grand passion you’d like to chase after, go for it. It may be far more doable than you might think.

"
4941,21 june 2018,sagittarius,"Money will be on your mind in a big way now that the Sun is in your house of net worth! But don’t get carried away too quickly by jumping into new investments or business deals. Impatient Mars could make you hot to trot, not a good thing if there are contracts that need to be signed. Take your time and research everything carefully.

Genius Uranus is active in your house of productivity, so chances are you could uncover a new way of getting things done that will impress muckety mucks. Self-employed?

With Pluto in a demanding position, it’s critical that you size up every move you’re going to make….and what other people are doing too. It would also help to say as little as possible.

"
4944,24 june 2018,sagittarius,"It may be difficult to figure out which is more reliable–your intuition or your logical left brain. That’s because they’re both operating equally well, so play it smart….rely on both!

"
4945,25 june 2018,sagittarius,"You may be getting hit with a crisis of confidence today, and this may rattle you a bit. Don’t worry–it’s just a Venus-Jupiter square that’s temporarily throwing you off. You’re growing past old boundaries, archer, and heading into unchartered territory. You can  do whatever it that you desire, so let this mini crisis pass.

"
4946,26 june 2018,sagittarius,"Your social life may slow down a bit now that Mars is retrograde, but that’s OK–you have some important business to take care of. Thursday’s full moon in your money sector recommends that you spend more time on developing a higher income.

"
4947,27 june 2018,sagittarius,"You don’t want to come off as being too emotional today, but it’s not smart to appear cold or controlled either. Find a happy balance between the two. You’ll be able to do your own thing once Mercury changes signs on Friday.

"
4948,28 june 2018,sagittarius,"Ready to see more green in your wallet? I thought so! Then you’ll be happy to know that tonight’s full moon occurs in your income sector. You could land a new client, gig or revenue stream. Maybe you’ll start a side hustle. As long as you don’t expect to make millions overnight, you’ll be on the right track.

"
4949,29 june 2018,sagittarius,"Your sign is famous for its independent streak and you’re entering into a fabulously free period! Lively Mercury zips into your ninth house of adventure and taking chances, so what would you like to try? Writing a book? Learning how to scuba dive? Study Chinese? Travel to parts unknown? Go for it.

"
4950,30 june 2018,sagittarius,"Trying to run from problems isn’t going to work, archer. Plunging yourself into work or partying may make you feel as though you don’t have to deal with the issue, but you do. Face it head on and get it over with.

"
4951,1 july 2018,sagittarius,"Your prospects are looking brighter and you should start to feel it! With heavy hitters Pluto and Saturn in your house of responsibility, you’ve been working hard. But your efforts have been worth it, and you should have proof of that by the end of the week.

"
4952,3 july 2018,sagittarius,"A positive lunar aspect will help you realize that some of your fears are unfounded. Greater peace of mind is on the way, especially after next Tuesday when Jupiter goes direct.

"
4953,4 july 2018,sagittarius,"You’re in more of a nesting mood these days. Planetary activity in your domestic sector is encouraging you to enjoy good times at home and in the company of loved ones, rather than whooping it up at a bar.

4954,5 july 2018,sagittarius,"Getting in touch with your deepest feelings becomes so much easier with the Sun in an illuminating position. Process those old emotions and dramas; let them go. This won’t happen overnight but it can take far less time than you might expect.

"
4955,6 july 2018,sagittarius,"People may simply not get what you’re all about and what you’re trying to say, archer. Which means that they could come at you verbally or in writing. Don’t sweat it; it’s not your job to explain the world or yourself to lesser minds!

"
4956,8 july 2018,sagittarius,"As Dorothy said in The Wizard of Oz, there’s no place like home. And that rings true today with Neptune being active in your domestic sector. This is a wonderful time to redecorate, remodel or look for new crib. Better yet is that the Sun is in a good place to find you some good deals.

"
4957,9 july 2018,sagittarius,"You’re in luck, archer. Venus, planet of love and money, is entering your house of achievement today. It should be easier than ever to make progress in these areas. But with Jupiter operating in your hush-hush zone, you need to keep things on the downlow.

4958,11 july 2018,sagittarius,"Impressing people in positions of power is much more easy than you may think, archer. Brilliant Uranus is active in your house of efficiency and getting things done, making you look like a winner. Don’t be afraid to show off your skills or brag about your accomplishments.

"
4959,12 july 2018,sagittarius,"This is no time to go off on a flight of fantasy, Sagittarius. You need to keep both feet firmly planted on the ground. This doesn’t mean, however, that life has to be boring. The cosmos is telling you simply to keep it real.

"
4960,13 july 2018,sagittarius,"Your sign is famous for going where angels fear to tread, Sagittarius. But sometimes you just have to balance passion with logic! Today’s solar eclipse in your house of intimacy and net worth could prompt you into making some big changes. However, a strong opposition from Pluto indicates that you need to take your time and use wisdom before taking action.

"
4961,14 july 2018,sagittarius,"Traditional love may be looking a heck of a lot more appealing, Sagittarius. Why settle for vague promises and confusion when you can experience the real deal? A sweet Venus-Saturn aspect helps you hammer out the details of a serious, long-lasting relationship.

There’s nothing wrong and looking out for yourself.

4963,16 july 2018,sagittarius,"Ancient astrologers were very well aware that sometimes, when it comes to love, people just want to flirt and play! But a more serious Venus-Moon connection today is encouraging you to seek greater stability when it comes to matters of the heart. That doesn’t mean that you should settle, however. Keep your standards high.

"
4964,17 july 2018,sagittarius,"Don’t feel as though you need to tiptoe around people. There are folks around you who are touchy, and they may be interested in making others feel guilty. If you have something to say to them, just say it, and let them deal with the fallout.

"
4965,18 july 2018,sagittarius,"You’re the independent sort, not always willing to take advice from other people. But a productive Moon-Mars aspect today suggests that you seek wisdom from others. This is truly important, because once the Sun rolls in to Leo on Sunday, big plans are going to really take off.

"
4966,19 july 2018,sagittarius,"People around you may not be willing to carry their share of the load, and you’re tired of it. You can hand them their head on a plate if that’s your desire. But it may just be a better move to start surrounding yourself with people who know how to get things done.

No pretenders need apply. Don’t be afraid to pull away if need be.

"
5029,23 september 2018,sagittarius,"In life there are two kinds of people: anchors and motors. Anchors are the kind of people who hold you back, who keep you in one place. Motors are the type of people who want to zip ahead and have enough a lot of fun. From your chart it appears that you need to cut loose from anchor-type people. Life is way too short!

"
5030,24 september 2018,sagittarius,"It’s make or break time when it comes to romance. Tonight’s full moon occurs in this part of your chart. Should you stay? Should you go?

You will be amazed at how energized you become as a result.

"

"
5053,18 october 2018,sagittarius,"Before you prattle on and say too much, slow down. Megamouth Mars is WAY too anxious to share today, when in reality you need to keep some things on the confidential side. Keep this in mind over the next five weeks, too.

5163,15 april 2018,capricorn,"Recent events may have put you on edge, Capricorn. Your peace of mind may have taken a beating to the point where it’s now non-existent. Mercury has been retrograde in your house of contentment, and thank goodness it stations direct today. Better yet is the arrival of a new moon tomorrow in the same part of your chart. Peace at last.

"
5164,16 april 2018,capricorn,"Just how dearly does your ego want to hold on to past dramas and negative emotions, Capricorn? A battle may be raging within as one part of you wants to be serene, while another is steadfastly sulking about your victimization. The good news is that today’s new moon in Aries is the perfect time to walk away from the old, unnecessary baggage. Are you ready to leave it behind?

"
5165,18 april 2018,capricorn,"Telling it like it is becomes easy with a confident Sun-Uranus aspect. No need to embellish the truth. No need to add drama. Just say what’s on your mind; your emotional comfort level depends on it.

"
5166,19 april 2018,capricorn,"You never give up, Capricorn–that’s one of the reasons your sign is considered to be the greatest achiever of the zodiac. With Mars in your sign you’re hell bent on making progress, but the good news is that your schedule may lighten up a little. Finding faster ways to do things is a smart way to go.

"
5167,20 april 2018,capricorn,"Capricorns have a reputation for being all buttoned up and traditional, but that stereotype is about to get tossed! The Sun is now in the most creative, authentic part of your chart, challenging you to break away from your old self image. This won’t be an overnight process; keep it going for a few months. This year is all about transitioning into a new lifestyle.

"
5168,21 april 2018,capricorn,"Needy people are going to have to get on line and take a number as far as you’re concerned, Capricorn. And whether you decide to “wait on” them is another issue! Seriously, when are other people going to learn how to take care of their own problems? When you give them all the space they need to figure it out for themselves.

"
5169,22 april 2018,capricorn,"Your incredible personal transition continues as Pluto retrogrades today in Capricorn. Saturn just did the same a few days ago. Over the next few months you’re going to plumb the depths of your psyche, goals and image. You’ll figure out where you’re giving your power away and what you need to do to be more calm and centered. It may not always be an easy ride, but the end result will be worth it.

"
5170,23 april 2018,capricorn,"It’s time to get your emotions under control, Capricorn. Yeah, I know, you always keep your cool. The problem is that you tend to keep things bottled up, and then there’s a raging storm going on in your mind. That’s not helpful, especially when it comes to feeling serene and centered. Today’s a good day to start a mindfulness meditation practice—or kick the sh** out of a bag in a kickboxing class.

"
5171,24 april 2018,capricorn,"The next three weeks are some of the best in 2018 for losing weight and getting in shape, Capricorn. Venus, planet of beauty, is now in your fitness sector. Thinks about what made previous attempts fail (Saturn in retrograde will help you with that), them switch to a smarter routine for fast results.

"
5172,25 april 2018,capricorn,"You’re a strong willed individual, sea goat, but even you can get confounded by life’s twists and turns. Today is one of those days when your logical mind won’t be able to readily come up with answers. That’s OK. By this time tomorrow, the cosmic skies clear and your analytical mind will be back with a vengeance.

"
5173,26 april 2018,capricorn,"Egads—everyone get out of Capricorn’s way!! The two most powerful, stubborn and downright strategic planets in the solar system meet up in your sign, turning you into a force to be reckoned with. Mars and Pluto will also help you come to some major life changing decisions. Just don’t steamroll over other people in your path—you may need them.

"
5174,27 april 2018,capricorn,"Your common sense is strong right now, but is that exactly news for a Capricorn? Too bad others can’t seem to operate at the same intelligent level as you. The saying “Why am I always surrounded by idiots?” could be your mantra over the next 24 hours. Why, why, WHY?

"
5175,28 april 2018,capricorn,"You’re no longer a child, so there’s no reason to let someone treat you like one. If anyone around you has a condescending, know-it-all attitude, give ‘em that famous Capricorn cold shoulder. Then keeping marching up to the summit, a place where you belong.

"
5176,29 april 2018,capricorn,"People are pulling upon you, Capricorn, and you may need to take a time out. This is true even of a lover or kids, if you have them. There’s only so much of you to go around. If you keep giving and giving, you’ll become burned out and resentful, which is not a place you want to be.

"
5177,30 april 2018,capricorn,"What are your core values, Capricorn? What kind of standards do you want to set for your life that you simply won’t breach? Tonight’s full moon asks that question, and it pushes you to walk away from outdated situations and dreams that no longer work for you. You’re currently in a strong, creative place too–there will be no shortage of ideas.

"
5178,1 may 2018,capricorn,"Being selective about the people you associate with is critical under current planetary conditions. This isn’t about being a snooty snob, or a brown noser who’s trying to kiss up to VIPs.  Rather, it’s about surrounding yourself with supportive people who add to your life rather than take things away from it, like your peace of mind and joy.

"
5179,2 may 2018,capricorn,"Give ‘em an inch and they’ll take a mile! Yup, it’s one of those days when the nicer and more helpful you are, the more you’ll get dumped on. Or worse—others will smile to your face then work against you behind the scenes. You know what to do, Capricorn. Keep your mouth shut and give them all the rope they need to hang themselves.

"
5180,3 may 2018,capricorn,"Your emotions could be taking you for a roller coaster ride this week, but being the stalwart creature that you are, this won’t last long! By tomorrow you’ll be snapping out of it and laying down some new laws. This includes you, sea goat—if you need to set higher standards for yourself, so be it.

"
5181,4 may 2018,capricorn,"Making the most of your talents is what the cosmos is encouraging you to do, Capricorn. If there’s a class that would help you, sign up for it. The same goes for seminars, podcasts or reading books. No one, no matter how talented they are, is completely done learning, and that includes you.

"
5182,5 may 2018,capricorn,"Anyone who tries to play you for a fool is making a mistake, Capricorn! You mean business these days and people are crazy if they don’t acknowledge it. There’s no need to rub their noses in it, though. Your confident demeanor speaks for itself.

"
5183,6 may 2018,capricorn,"You’re usually pretty blunt, but today the words can flow like honey. And trust me, the bees will be a’ buzzin’! Go ahead: flirt, charm, negotiate or schmooze your little heart out. Your creativity is running high too, so let your talents shine.

"
5184,7 may 2018,capricorn,"Insecurities could get the better of you today, so try to view everything through a logical lens. People are definitely acting weird but you don’t have to let it throw you off balance. Besides, you have more power and control in your little finger than they have collectively. Remember who’s boss!

"
5185,8 may 2018,capricorn,"It’s your life, Capricorn, and you deserve to live it your way. So don’t let other people tell you what to do. Likewise, stop comparing yourself to your friends or the social media stars who seem to have it all. You’re a unique creature. Break away from the pack.

"
5186,9 may 2018,capricorn,"You tend to be straight forward and tell it like it is, kind of like Spock on Star Trek.  But today it might be fun (and useful!) to add some passion to your words, whether they’re the spoken or written kind. The Moon is in a wonderful spot for letting your words flow with color and pizzazz.

"
5187,10 may 2018,capricorn,"Some creative ideas could pop into your mind today, and if you’re smart you’ll take action on them. Maybe it’s an idea for a book or a blog. Perhaps you’ve been thinking about taking some art classes this summer or taking up a hobby. FYI: once Uranus enters Taurus next Tuesday, you’re entering the most awe-inspiring, talent-driven episodes of your entire life.

"
5188,11 may 2018,capricorn,"People need to know where you’re coming from, Capricorn, so don’t be afraid to get your feelings or opinions out there. This isn’t about venting or crying, but happily sharing with people you care about. It’s also a wonderful day for artistic expression or showcasing your talent.

"
5189,12 may 2018,capricorn,"If anyone even thinks about ruining your day with their nonsense, you won’t take too kindly to it! And why should you? Over the past eight years you’ve been there for everyone else. Now it’s your turn.

"
5190,13 may 2018,capricorn,"You’re famous for being the hardest working sign of the zodiac, and from your chart it appears that you’re way overdue for some good times.

Fortunately it moves on tomorrow to a new place that’s a heck of a lot more fun! But before it goes, Uranus gives you one last push to drop any toxic mojo that’s taking away your serenity.

"
5192,15 may 2018,capricorn,"An extraordinary time begins for you, sea goat. Lightning-like Uranus is now in your house of romance, fun and creativity. Most Capricorns alive today have never experienced this placement, and it’s well overdue! You need to lighten up, stop and smell the flowers and take in life’s sweeter pleasures. A different kind of lover could come your way between now and 2026. Your talents will skyrocket as you take a chance on doing things that others can’t even imagine. Kudos!

"
5193,16 may 2018,capricorn,"A sparkling new moon occurs in your house of creativity, helping you dig deep into that well of talent you possess.

Inspiration may strike you when you least expect it, so keep a notepad or your cell notepad handy.

"
5194,17 may 2018,capricorn,"Assertive Mars is tearing through your money house which could create a “spend, spend, spend” mentality. It might be coming from someone else, like a kid or a lover who is demanding that you pull out your wallet and buy them things. Don’t go there. You need to start earning and saving more first.

"
5195,18 may 2018,capricorn,"Your ruler, Saturn, is now in your sign and couldn’t be happier. Today the ringed planet forms a fabulous trine with Mercury in your house of creativity, romance and fun. It’s time to inject more passion and delight into your life, whatever that means to you. Quit being the hamster on the wheel and enjoy life more.

"
5196,19 may 2018,capricorn,"You tend to be a lone warrior, even feeling that way in love sometimes. Fortunately cooperative Venus enters your house of partnering, making it easier to gain cooperation from others—which includes lovers! Single sea goats could meet someone quite unexpectedly thanks to wild card Uranus stirring things up.

"
5197,20 may 2018,capricorn,"Your sign is famous for its discipline but over the next four weeks you’re going to be even more regimented than usual. That’s because the Sun enters the most productive part of your chart today. But don’t try to do it all alone! With Venus in your partnership sector you should be reaching out to people who can help you.

"
5198,21 may 2018,capricorn,"Yogis refer to “monkey mind”, that state in which our mind can’t stay focused on one thing and hops around like mad. A strong lunar aspect helps you work on this mental state so that you can chill out and focus like a laser beam.

"
5199,22 may 2018,capricorn,"Try a little tenderness! Verbal Mercury is in a good place today to help you express yourself, especially to people you love. Don’t hold back. Kids, parents, friends, a lover and even your pets should all know just how much you treasure them.

"
5200,23 may 2018,capricorn,"Nothing is going to stop you from getting the job done, and I almost pity anyone who gets in your way. This is one of the best days all year for streamlining your life and developing strong habits that are surefire ways to succeed,

"
5201,24 may 2018,capricorn,"From your chart it looks like you need to cut back on some of your commitments, Capricorn. There are only 24 hours in a day and you can only do so much. Fortunately a beneficial Mars-Sun trine helps you prioritize what’s important—which may include some much needed down time.

"
5202,25 may 2018,capricorn,"You’re so often looked up to as being an expert that it may not occur to you to seek wisdom elsewhere. But you should. A fabulous Jupiter-Neptune trine opens doors for you to meet influencers, movers and shakers. This could happen face to face or online, as Jupiter is in the tech sector. Who knows? You might become an influencer yourself.

"
5203,26 may 2018,capricorn,"From your chart it appears that although you want to have fun with people, you don’t want to be tied down. This could be on a romantic level but in other relationships as well. Not only that, you need to spend more time with folks who truly know how to live—abundantly, creatively.

"
5204,27 may 2018,capricorn,"There is no place in your life for empty promises and flattery.

"
5205,28 may 2018,capricorn,"A tense lunar aspect indicates that you should stick to your own views on life rather than relying on the opinions of other people. Tomorrow’s full moon in Sagittarius will help you put an end to circumstances in your life that are outdated or toxic, and you need to have clarity to do so. Your own wisdom should work just fine.

"
5206,29 may 2018,capricorn,"Out with the old, in with the new! No, it’s not New Year’s Eve.

Fortunately wise Mercury enters your house of habits too, making it easier to stick to your decisions.

"
5207,30 may 2018,capricorn,"Your intuition is in overdrive today, but that doesn’t mean that it’s accurate! People may be gossiping or making remarks that have no substance behind them.

"
5208,31 may 2018,capricorn,"A new kind of determination is building inside of you, a kind that you may not have experienced before. You’re starting to understand that there is a different way of viewing life, one that involves simplifying things enormously. It’s a Zen kind of a vibe.

"
5209,1 june 2018,capricorn,"With megawatt Mars in your income sector for the first time in two years, you should be hell bent on making mo’ money. An awesome Mercury-Mars aspect is just the ticket for getting real about how you’re going to accomplish this task. Next Tuesday it will all come together.

"
5210,2 june 2018,capricorn,"You can’t go wrong when the two most inspirational planets are in a good mood!

Sure, you may be saying to yourself, my sign is the most rational one of the twelve. But it’s really due to a no-nonsense Sun-Mercury aspect going on in the heavens right now. Just keep plugging away and ignore the crazy rants of others.

"
5213,5 june 2018,capricorn,"You’re in no mood today to tolerate fools who have no clue what’s going on. Nor should you! But is it really necessary to get into a debate with them about their stupidity? Don’t waste your precious time.

"
5214,6 june 2018,capricorn,"Conforming to traditions is a stereotype for your sign, but people don’t really know that you’re quite capable of blazing your own trail.

"
5215,7 june 2018,capricorn,"Teamwork could be hard to come by today, so don’t expect others to do their fair share. It’s possible that they are simply confused about their role or the tasks in front of them. If that’s the case, you may need to be the person who straighten things out for them. Otherwise, they’re slacking!

"
5216,8 june 2018,capricorn,"The weekend’s planetary energy is just right for relaxing at home. That is, of course, if your home is a happy one! Parents or siblings could get on your nerves, even if they’re not living under your roof. Turn off your phone and don’t check your e-mails.

"
5217,9 june 2018,capricorn,"With strong man Pluto and wise old Saturn in your sign, you should be feeling empowered. So why are you feeling a bit uneasy? It’s due to the Moon in a tough angle from your house of serenity. You’ve been pushing yourself hard; it’s time for a rest.

"
5219,11 june 2018,capricorn,"You’re sure of yourself, especially your values, and no one will be able to make you see differently. But that doesn’t mean that others won’t try! Just ignore them and move on. You’re on the right track.

"
5222,14 june 2018,capricorn,"You usually keep your cool but a tense Venus-Uranus aspect could cook your last nerve. An emotional outburst may result, and hopefully not at your end.

"
5223,15 june 2018,capricorn,"Your ruler, Saturn, is in your sign, a match made in the heavens. You mean business and will protect your ideas and plans like a warrior.

"
5227,19 june 2018,capricorn,"Finding people who share your vision and values becomes a lot easier with a meeting of chatty Mercury and optimistic Jupiter.

"
5231,23 june 2018,capricorn,"Is it time for a personal makeover, Capricorn? Why not? It seems as though you have some outdated opinions of yourself. It’s time to see yourself in a brand new light, without giving a care to what anyone else thinks of you.

"
5233,25 june 2018,capricorn,"You’re not one to easily conform with whatever “the group” thinks or does.

"
5256,19 july 2018,capricorn,"You may be questioning whether or not you have the chops to pull something off. Self-doubt is not your thing, but you could be hit with it today. This, however, is just a part of forward movement for you. Your ideas are changing which means that your life is going to change. And change makes a lot of people feel uncomfortable.

"
5257,21 july 2018,capricorn,"Your optimism should be rising! The two luckiest planets in the solar system, Venus and Jupiter, are encouraging you to take risks and also to meet new people. Your values and dreams are changing, becoming bigger and bolder by the day. Kudos!

5259,23 july 2018,capricorn,"You may be feeling a little tongue tied over the next few days, Capricorn. That’s because foggy Neptune is active in your house of communication. Therefore, you need to think before you put things in writing and before they leave your mouth. The last thing you need is someone accusing you of being indirect.

"
5260,24 july 2018,capricorn,"Your mind may be operating at a higher level than the people around you, Capricorn. “Ha! So what else is new”, you maybe thinking. Just be aware that others may try to baffle you with BS due to a Venus-Neptune opposition. You’ll see right through it of course, but don’t engage with these people.

"

This is especially true when it comes to career and financial matters. Mercury’s retrograde spin, which begins tomorrow, will actually help you gain clarity. So will the lunar eclipse on Friday.

"
5262,26 july 2018,capricorn,"You are in a terrific position to boost both your income and your net worth. The Sun is in your wealth sector, and Friday’s lunar eclipse occurs in your house of earnings. However, Mercury starts to spin backwards today in the house of wealth. This means that you need to carefully consider the next steps you are planning on taking. You don’t have a shortage of options; you need to choose the right ones.

"

A dynamic Pluto-Venus aspect today encourages you to push past previous boundaries. Travel to a place that’s off the grid. Write that book (finally). Launch a startup. Date a completely new type.

Over the next four weeks you will be able to uncover some fabulous new income sources, provided you’re willing to be on the hunt.

"
5266,30 july 2018,capricorn,"It’s time to break out of your work groove and socialize a bit more, Capricorn. Yes, you have a lot of planetary action in your house and earning money.

Keep it real.

"
5274,10 august 2018,capricorn,"Who is on Team Capricorn? That’s the question as Jupiter squares Mercury. You have a lot going for you right now, and it shows.

"
5276,12 august 2018,capricorn,"Mars was  cruising through your income sector, but today it starts to back spin into your sign. This could play out in several ways. First, you may decide to revamp some of your most important goals or dreams. Or they may stay the same, but you start putting more pressure on yourself to achieve them. Relax. Rome wasn’t built in a day.

"
5277,13 august 2018,capricorn,"It could be hard to separate fact from fiction today. Foggy Neptune is swirling its mist, slowing down your thinking and twisting the words of others. This little cosmic storm is gone by tomorrow however. The moon will then be in the most decisive part of your chart, and the fog will clear.

"
5278,14 august 2018,capricorn,"Cue the Isley Brothers, circa 1969: “It’s your thing, do what you want to do. I can’t tell you who to sock it to.” Yup, it’s all about doing your own thang!

"
5287,23 august 2018,capricorn,"The past month may have been an emotional one, and now you’re ready for some optimism, rather than drama.

Dust off that bucket list and place your focus on an activity that will bring you joy, such as travel or meeting interesting new people.

"
5288,24 august 2018,capricorn,"The Navy SEALs training is considered to be the toughest regimen on earth. Very few make it through. They call it “the crucible”: a place where you get ground down emotionally until you emerge victorious, like a phoenix rising from the ashes. You’ve been going through a similar process lately as the Moon and three planets in your sign have been grinding you down. But the result will be a wiser, more powerful you.

"
5289,25 august 2018,capricorn,"Your sign is famous for being on the traditional, conservative side, but right now you’re willing to push past that stereotype. You’re in a highly creative, free-thinking mood, and the best part is that some of your more outre ideas could actually go somewhere.

"
5291,27 august 2018,capricorn,"It feels good to be a Capricorn again. Mars has been retrograde in your sign for the past few weeks, perhaps making you question your confidence, image or plans. But now that it’s direct you should start to feel more ambitious and in control.

"
5292,28 august 2018,capricorn,"The roles and responsibilities of people in your world may need to be revised, whether at work or at home.

"
5293,29 august 2018,capricorn,"Your cash flow situation may be feeling like a trickle instead of a raging river of money pouring in, but that’s about to change. Now that Mars is direct in your sign you will be unstoppable. Keep spending in check until your efforts pay off.

"
5294,30 august 2018,capricorn,"You seem to know what you want, but there’s a little voice inside your head saying “really?”  Or…”are you sure you can do this?” Tell that little voice to shut up. Ignore it. You’re on the right track, and there is no room for self-doubt.

"
5295,31 august 2018,capricorn,"A sudden burst of creativity and fresh thinking is just what you need right now. And the good news is that the cosmos is going to deliver it! A Moon-Uranus aspect will fire you up. Start living a more authentic, vibrant lifestyle.

"
5296,1 september 2018,capricorn,"Your sign is famous for doing things the traditional way, but that means that you can get stuck in a rut. Why are you afraid to let your freak flag fly?

"
5297,2 september 2018,capricorn,"Being physically healthy is one of the greatest assets you can have, and today a lunar aspect tells you to be more proactive. You weren’t destined to be overweight or to suffer from chronic maladies! Vibrant wellness isn’t a gift that “some people” receive. Step up to the plate. Do it.

"
5298,3 september 2018,capricorn,"Facts and opinions are two different things, and today you need to sort them out. Fortunately intelligent, logical Mercury is in a good place to help you do so. Once Saturn goes direct in your sign on Thursday, you need to be dealing with realities, not fantasies.

"
5299,4 september 2018,capricorn,"You’re ruler, Saturn, is retrograde in your sign. This means you’re probably rethinking all sorts of things, including your closest relationships. If anyone in your world creating too much drama, chances are you’re going to set them straight—or cut them loose.

"
5300,5 september 2018,capricorn,"Feeling the urge to learn more? It could happen now that mental Mercury is in your house of mind expansion. You might go back to college and get another degree. Or perhaps you’ll take a class that will help you get a license for your trade. Maybe you’ll just take a class for the heck of it, like art or a foreign language. This energy continues for most of the month, so take it seriously.

"
5301,6 september 2018,capricorn,"Have you been feeling a little bit off? If so, you can blame it on Saturn which has been retrograde in your sign for several months.

"
5303,8 september 2018,capricorn,"You’re ready to run people over who get in your way. The question is—do they deserve it, and is this necessary? Maybe it is! But think twice before you act. Once Venus changes signs tomorrow you’ll need to be very  cooperative if you want to get anywhere.

There is also a new Moon in your house of optimism and thinking big. This is the perfect cocktail for aligning with people who are movers and shakers. Don’t worry, you won’t have to give up your independence. But you will benefit from being around people who know how to make things happen….and who love being alive.

"
5305,10 september 2018,capricorn,"You’re open to trying all sorts of new things these days, Capricorn. Yesterday’s new Moon in your house of adventure will see to that. And now that Mars is in your house earning money, you might start considering fresh new income sources. This could include passive income, like investment real estate, or starting your own business. But you also might decide to take a leap in your existing occupation.

"
5306,11 september 2018,capricorn,"The sturdy goat is getting tired of plodding up the mountain, doing things the same old way.

Some of the connections that you make over the next few days could be around for a very long time.

"
5308,13 september 2018,capricorn,"As usual, you’re seeing the big picture. As usual, you can conceive ideas that others can’t wrap their brains around. It ain’t easy being brilliant, but you’re just going to have to deal with it today.

"
5309,14 september 2018,capricorn,"You may feel like throwing your hands up in the air and walking away from the pile of work on your desk, or the mess at home. It seems like the matter how hard you work, the job is never done. Just do what you can today, Capricorn. You may feel like this over the next week, but by the time the Sun enters Libra on the 22nd, you’ll be fine.

"
5310,15 september 2018,capricorn,"Did you ever watch Star Trek? Remember that line, “to boldly go where no man has gone before”? That’s kind of the position that you’re in right now. Transformational Pluto is telling you to start taking some risks. And from your chart looks like you’re actually going to do it! It’s about time.

"
5311,16 september 2018,capricorn,"You’ve got the big picture in mind, and this is a good thing. You are usually so focused and determined that you can forget to see the overall scheme of things. More adventurous options are available to you; keep your eyes open for them.

"
5313,18 september 2018,capricorn,"You may have had it with somebody’s antics, but reaming them out won’t help matters. Actually, it might make things worse. You may feel like the only sane person in your environment, and that may be the case! Let them have their hissy fit while you move on.

"
5318,24 september 2018,capricorn,"You have some decisions to make, Capricorn, things that might be making you a little bit uncomfortable right now.

Follow the path that allows you to be authentic.

"
5319,25 september 2018,capricorn,"Right now I’m reading a book by a former Navy SEAL. These guys were taught how to focus like a laser beam on whatever challenge they had ahead of them. From your chart, it appears that you need to do the same thing. You’re dispersing your energy into many projects, which means that you won’t get anything done. Select one.

"

"
5322,28 september 2018,capricorn,"Playing it too safe? From your chart it looks like you could add some spice to your life. This isn’t so much about your career as it is your appearance.

"
5323,29 september 2018,capricorn,"It’s time to shore up your health, Capricorn. You’ve been pushing yourself very hard and your vitality may be low.

"
5332,9 october 2018,capricorn,"Reach out to people who count, Capricorn. Mercury is now in your house of networking. Other people could help you find a new job or financing for your business.

"
5339,16 october 2018,capricorn,"Start doing a better job of looking out for yourself, Capricorn. This isn’t about being selfish. It’s about protecting yourself from the daily onslaught of deadlines and crazy people and BS. If you don’t start pulling away, you’ll become so spent that there will be nothing left.

"
5340,17 october 2018,capricorn,"You need to develop some stronger foundations in your life, Capricorn. Flying by the seat of your pants just isn’t going to cut it any longer.

This is true at the office, with your friends and other teams you may be part of, such as volunteer organizations. Creative Neptune is inspiring you to brainstorm and strategize.

"
5344,21 october 2018,capricorn,"Your confidence speaks for itself. You know that you’re on the right path, but you could also inspire others. So if a friend or a team could use the boost, don’t hold back. Share your wisdom, honesty and enthusiasm.

"
5345,22 october 2018,capricorn,"Keep personal information just that: personal. The Sun is getting ready to enter one of the most social parts of your chart, but that doesn’t mean that everyone you meet needs to get the 411. Choose your confidantes carefully.

"
5348,25 october 2018,capricorn,"You’re in desperate need of having some fun, which does NOT include watching Netflix. With the Moon in the most artistic and cultured part of your chart you should plan museum visits, go to concerts or take in a play. Why not make this a regular habit?

"
5350,27 october 2018,capricorn,"You know what you want. You have a plan. So what’s holding you back? Even the fearless goat can be unsure from time to time about where they’re heading. If you need advice, seek it. Mentors are out there waiting to provide you with the guidance you need.

"
5351,28 october 2018,capricorn,"There are only so many hours in a day, and from your chart, it appears that you’ve been burning the candle at both ends.

"
5354,31 october 2018,capricorn,"Sshhhh!!!! It’s time to go undercover. Now that shrewd Mercury is in the most secretive part of your chart, you can do your best work alone. Maybe you need to get rid of some bad habits. Or maybe you’re planning on moving on from an unhappy relationship. Perhaps it’s time to leave a soul sucking job. Do you have to do, and do it quietly.

"
5355,1 november 2018,capricorn,"You don’t have to play by other peoples’ rules, Capricorn. So if anyone tries to coerce you into doing things their way, forget it. While you’re at it, why don’t you buck the system too!

"
5356,2 november 2018,capricorn,"Keep your on the big picture, Capricorn. Right now you run the risk of focusing on things that aren’t important in the grand scheme of life. The little stuff is never going to go away, so why bother even thinking about it?

"
5362,8 november 2018,capricorn,"The saying “out with the old, in with the new” is usually reserved for New Year’s Eve. But Jupiter’s move into your house of closure and transition marks a life turning point. Over the next year, you can do some much-needed inner work. Healing your body and your mind are quite possible. Keep things on the down low. Research your options and make plans to move onto a much higher level of existence.

"

"
5368,15 november 2018,capricorn,"Watch what you say! Mega mouth Mars is now in your house of communication. The problem is that Mercury retrogrades tomorrow in your house of confidentiality, which could throw off your judgment. If in doubt, and don’t say it…and don’t write it.

"
5369,16 november 2018,capricorn,"You’re in an interesting spot, Capricorn. Mercury is now spinning backward in your house of confidentiality. You really need to keep a lid on things.

"
5373,21 november 2018,capricorn,"You know what needs to be done, so get on with it already. You know that you’re going to face roadblocks. Naturally you have fears or concerns. But nothing is going to stop you, and that knowledge should be enough.

"
5374,22 november 2018,capricorn,"On the outside, you may appear friendly and charming. But on the inside, there’s a lot going on in the brain of yours.

But the Sun and Jupiter are forming a conjunction in your house of closure and transition, the best possible aspect in astrology. Seriously, it’s time. Do the inner work necessary. Mars is a wonky angle, though, so don’t tell everyone what you’re up to.

"
5379,27 november 2018,capricorn,"You are going through a period of extreme mental cleansing. Yesterday’s Jupiter-Sun aspect was designed to help you close out the past and things that aren’t working. Today intelligent Mercury gets into the act, bringing things in to clear focus. Confusion begone.

"
5380,28 november 2018,capricorn,"You have a lot of planetary action going on in your house of secrecy, which means that you should be keeping most things below the radar. But today there is an exception. A strong Saturn-Mars aspect encourages you to get things out into the open, either verbally or in writing. Just be highly selective about what it is that you reveal.

"
5381,29 november 2018,capricorn,"Been thinking about starting a home based business or a side hustle? A Moon-Uranus trine makes now the perfect time to do so. Be aware that this “little business idea” of yours could turn into something big, really big. But Steve Jobs got started in his garage, and we all know how that story goes!

"
5382,30 november 2018,capricorn,"If your life has been out of balance in any way, you’ll certainly feel it today. The cosmos will deliver a wakeup call. It shouldn’t be anything real serious, but enough to make you realize that you need some down time.

"
5385,5 december 2018,capricorn,"If something seems off, it probably is. Your intuition is running high these days, but don’t be too quick to act on it. You need more intel, which will only come over time. Patience.

"
5390,11 december 2018,capricorn,"You need to strike a good balance between your personal down time and the time you spend with friends.

"
5391,12 december 2018,capricorn,"From your chart it looks like you have a lot of things to sort out. Fortunately clever Mercury glides into the most secretive, psychological part of your chart. Don’t explain anything to anyone; just work things out in your head behind the scenes.

"
5392,13 december 2018,capricorn,"Keep things to yourself, no matter how much you’re dying to talk. Yes, you’re under a lot of pressure but you can’t trust everyone, sad to say. Learn new ways to cope with the stress. Mindfulness, journaling, aerobic workouts–do whatever it takes.

"
5393,14 december 2018,capricorn,"You need to make changes in the way you think, Capricorn. “Bullsh**”, I can hear you saying. “I’m the most mature and hardest working sign of the zodiac.”  True…..but that doesn’t mean that your thought processes are perfect.

"
5394,15 december 2018,capricorn,"Neurologists have discovered that the human brain is “plastic”, meaning that we’re not stuck dealing with rigid old behaviors and thought patterns.

5397,18 december 2018,capricorn,"You don’t have to put up with bad behavior from others, Capricorn. Enough is enough. But with planets gliding through the most hush-hush part of your chart, you don’t need to make a big production of this.

5440,4 april 2018,aquarius,"No matter how polite or sensible you may be, you can’t count on others to be the same way! Resistance could be strong today but it could be the hidden kind. Steer clear of known malcontents and those whom you suspect to be closet trolls.

"
5441,5 april 2018,aquarius,"Your inner “self talk” appears to need an upgrade. It’s time to quit blaming, fretting and obsessing. Furthermore, you need to shut that brain of yours down  and give it a rest! Why not start a meditating, journaling or mindfulness practice?

"
5442,6 april 2018,aquarius,"Getting along better with family members is in the stars! No one can push our buttons better or faster than family, but these days progress can be made. It will require teamwork, but that’s better than trying to do everything on your own.

"
5443,7 april 2018,aquarius,"It’s Saturday and you may usually go out on the town, but today’s cosmic activity suggests a quiet night at home! Canoodle with your honey behind closed doors. Or if there’s no honey in sight, pamper yourself instead. A spa visit may be in order too.

"
5444,9 april 2018,aquarius,"Mercury is retrograde in your third house of thinking, strategizing and expression, so your opinions could be changing frequently. There’s nothing wrong with that as it will help you sort out your thoughts. Clarity returns around the 15th and 16th, so keep on pondering til then.

"
5445,10 april 2018,aquarius,"It’s a waste of time to get others to do things your way, especially when they feel entitled to their behavior. You’re better off doing things your own way for now. Once Mercury goes direct on the 15th you’ll be able to communicate with them more directly.

"
5446,11 april 2018,aquarius,"Feeling comfortable in your closest relationships is what it’s all about today. After all, if you’re not at ease within your friendships, love life or family situation, how happy can you be? A wonderful Venus-Mars trine helps you work things out and create deeper bonds.

"
5447,12 april 2018,aquarius,"Your sign is famous for its outgoing, independent attitude but right now you may be craving warm and fuzzy moments at home. The next few days are well aspected for relaxing chez vous  rather than partying on the town. So start baking some mac and cheese, get a hot cup of tea and turn on Netflix.

"
5448,13 april 2018,aquarius,"It may seem that others have the upper hand in career and other matters, but this is a temporary situation. Keep calm and carry on. Your perseverance will be noted and rewarded in the not so distant future.

"
5449,14 april 2018,aquarius,"What a day for a daydream! Misty Neptune is swirling up activity in your subconscious mind, and the best part is that these daydreams could actually become reality. All the more reason to pay close attention to them, and the kinds of visions you have while you sleep too.

"
5450,15 april 2018,aquarius,"OK, the coast is clear. You can now open your mouth and say what you want. Well, maybe not everything! Mercury goes direct today in your house of communicating. And tomorrow a new moon takes place in this sector, enabling you to go loud and proud with whatever message you want to get out there.

"
5451,16 april 2018,aquarius,"There’s a new moon today in your house of thinking and self-expression which could encourage you to speak up and get your name and ideas out there. But Saturn and Pluto will retrograde next week in your house of secrecy, indicating that you need to only reveal what’s necessary.

"
5452,17 april 2018,aquarius,"You’re entering a thoughtful time, a period in which you may change your mind about many things. Saturn begins a months long retrograde in the house of the subconscious mind, urging you to do a mental detox! Pluto will retrograde here too within a few days time, exposing all of the times and places where you’re giving away your power.

"
5453,18 april 2018,aquarius,"Seems like everyone wants their ideas and image to go viral these days, but how many people actually succeed? You’re the most likely sign to be seen and heard thanks to a dazzling Sun-Uranus meet up today in your house of communication. Work it!

"
5454,19 april 2018,aquarius,"With so much planetary activity going on in the most emotional and mental part of your chart, you may be feeling more cautious than usual. This is actually a good place to be, as you won’t be likely to make mistakes by jumping in to things too quickly. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have any fun either!

"
5455,20 april 2018,aquarius,"Domestic and family matters come to the fore now that the Sun is in Taurus. Your relationships with your kids, lover and parents may need be revised. Creating a beautiful, comfortable home is also important, whether you’re single or attached. Living in a serene environment—and carrying that peace of mind with you all day—is the goal!

"
5456,21 april 2018,aquarius,"Old habits are hard to break, but break them you must. Wise Saturn is now retrograde in your house of mental health and routines, and Pluto begins to spin backward there tomorrow. Be honest with yourself, dig deep and determine what needs to be changed.

"
5457,22 april 2018,aquarius,"It’s time to purge your psyche of toxic trash, Aquarius. Subterranean Pluto has gone retrograde in your house of dramas, emotions and the past. The next few months could be revolutionary, changing your life and attitude in ways that you simply can’t imagine right now. Seek help if you need it or do your own inner work.

"
5458,23 april 2018,aquarius,"There’s an awful lot of energy right now asking you to focus on your goals, which is a good thing as you may need to readjust your vision. And lucky you, the Moon is in the most creative part of your chart! So take some time to think outside the box. How can you add more pizzazz to your life while you go after your heart’s desire?

"
5459,24 april 2018,aquarius,"Lucky Aquarius! Amorous Venus enters your house of romance today, setting up a three week period in which you could enjoy the attention of a lover (and that includes a new flame!). With next week’s full moon occurring in your house of goals, chances are you’ll be thinking long term when it comes to love.

"
5460,25 april 2018,aquarius,"Keep your mouth shut and just plow ahead today, Aquarius. Stern Saturn in your house of confidentiality recommends the silent treatment. Anything you say could be used against you later on, so don’t give the trolls and naysayers any ammunition.

"
5461,26 april 2018,aquarius,"Sshhh!!! A top secret meeting of Mars and Pluto turns you into either super spy James Bond, psychic John Edward or the Wizard of Oz (“pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!”). Seriously, your ability to get things done behind the scenes is unparalleled today. Dig deep. Solve mysteries. Uncover amazing solutions. Use your imagination, wisdom and intuition.

"
5462,27 april 2018,aquarius,"You’re saying the right things, but do you have the right audience? Make sure that you’re not wasting your time talking to people who aren’t going to get it. This is just as true in your personal life as it is in your professional one. Either hone your message or find a different crowd.

"
5463,28 april 2018,aquarius,"Pushing past our own personal boundaries can be scary sometimes. Fear sets in, along with worries about what will happen next. Will we succeed? Are loved ones going to support us in our quest? Those kinds of thoughts may go through your head today. Fortunately the full moon on Monday will make them go bye-bye.

"
5464,29 april 2018,aquarius,"It’s time to make some major decisions about the direction your life is heading in, Aquarius. Tomorrow’s full moon demands it! Today you might find yourself in quite a reflective mood, assessing what should stay and what needs to go. Your serenity depends upon it.

"
5465,30 april 2018,aquarius,"The annual full moon in your ambition and success sector is a winner! If you’re looking to make more money, know that inspirational Neptune is in a terrific angle to the moon. So is Mars, and they’re both in houses that govern intuition and logical thought too. Use your gut to come up with ideas for scoring more dinero.

"
5466,1 may 2018,aquarius,"The full moon yesterday set up a two-week period in which you can make amazing progress toward all of your major goals. The problem is that your thinking may not be clear due to wonky Uranus acting up in your house of mental activity. You also run the risk of blurting out your ideas to people who shouldn’t know about them. Slow down….and shut up!

"
5467,2 may 2018,aquarius,"You may decide to keep people at arm’s length today as petty behavior could erupt among friends or lovers. Likewise, you need to make sure that you’re not acting snarky or jealous. Tomorrow is a smart time to study your thoughts and ask yourself if you’re being the best person you can be. Also, are your friends true blue?

"
5468,3 may 2018,aquarius,"Your dream state could be especially active these days so pay close attention to what flows in! Once red hots Mars moves into your sign on the 16th you can start acting on gut hunches.

"
5469,4 may 2018,aquarius,"It’s a great day for balancing both the right and left side of your brain. Logic and emotions can work hand in hand instead of doing battle, so take this positive energy and run with it.

"
5470,5 may 2018,aquarius,"There will be a lot of activity going on in your subconscious mind this weekend. Don’t be surprised if your dream state becomes more active, or gut hunches keep popping up. Pay attention to these valuable nuggets of wisdom.

"
5471,6 may 2018,aquarius,"Who says that stability can’t be sexy? It can be, thanks to a yummy Sun-Neptune connection. Torrid romances might make for great books and movies, but not so much in real life.

"
5472,7 may 2018,aquarius,"It will be easy to get swept away today….too  easy. Murky Neptune and Venus are stuck in a fantasy-fueled opium den of delusion. Therefore, don’t kid yourself about anyone or anything. Clarity should return by Friday.

"
5473,8 may 2018,aquarius,"From your chart it appears that you desperately need some “me” time. Family members, pets and lovers may also be crying out for more attention. The problem is that your job responsibilities or other worries may be wearing you down….all the more reason to take good care of yourself and the ones you love.

"
5474,9 may 2018,aquarius,"Get out of my way! Your determination rises thanks to a potent Moon-Saturn aspect. Other people may not notice your new attitude at first, but that’s OK. They’ll figure it out soon enough.

"
5475,10 may 2018,aquarius,"Keep your wits about you where money is concerned. It’s not that smarmy snake oil salesmen are going to try to rip you off. It’s more like unrealistic thinking on your part about where money is going to come from or how expensive things will be. Tomorrow is a better day for budgeting.

"
5476,11 may 2018,aquarius,"Feeling emo? It’s not surprising considering that the Sun and Pluto are active in the most personal, stability-centered parts of your chart. But don’t feel guilty about sharing what’s going on in your heart and your mind. This is one of the best days all year to open up.

"
5477,12 may 2018,aquarius,"Your intuition could be way off base today, so don’t say or do anything based on what your gut is telling you. Likewise your mind could be dreaming up worst case scenarios that have nothing to do with reality. Keep it real.

"
5478,13 may 2018,aquarius,"Get on top of family squabbles and housing matters over the next three weeks. Practical, smooth-talking Mercury is now in your domestic sector, and there will be a new moon here on Tuesday as well. You may have to get a little pushy but do what it takes to straighten things out.

"
5479,14 may 2018,aquarius,"The sudden desire to expand your mind could hit you out of the blue today, Aquarius. This could involve signing up for a class, studying a new philosophy or networking with people who have a bigger view of the world. It’s all good, and you may be surprised at what you discover.

"
5480,15 may 2018,aquarius,"Home is where the heart is, and over the next eight years your domestic life will get a complete makeover. Uranus, planet of rapid change, is now in your home and family sector until 2026. Relocating, having kids, helping your parents, buying your first place, developing greater inward contentment—all of these are possible.

"
5481,16 may 2018,aquarius,"Feeling comfortable in your own skin is what it’s all about, thanks to Uranus entering your house of family, home and security. A new moon has just taken place here too, opening up a six month period in which you’re going to demand more quality time with the ones you love. Career matters will just have to wait. While you’re at it, make sure to devote some much needed time and attention to your own self care.

"
5482,17 may 2018,aquarius,"Mars is in your house, making you feisty as all get out. And you won’t take kindly to anyone who gets in your face and tries to push their agenda. A Mars-Uranus square could make this happen, so keep your cool. The weekend is a good time to set boundaries, which may simply mean quietly pulling away from malcontents.

"
5483,18 may 2018,aquarius,"Your ability to find serenity and contentment skyrockets with an amazing Mercury-Saturn trine—no woo-woo stuff involved! Nope, this is all about being logical and real. Calmly figure out what’s throwing you off balance and resolve to fix it.

"
5484,19 may 2018,aquarius,"Teamwork will count for a lot over the next few weeks, now that diplomatic Venus is in your house of getting things done. Stop being the go-to person. Quit thinking that you’re the only one who’s smart enough to do the task. You might be, but isn’t it getting tiresome to be the dependable one?

"
5485,20 may 2018,aquarius,"In the mood for love? You should be now that the Sun is in your house of romance. But you won’t be in an airy-fairy place. On the contrary! Practicality rules and you are going to want a lover who is a team player. There’s a strong physical vibe going on right now so you and your amour should be engaged in sports– both inside and outside the bedroom.

"
5486,21 may 2018,aquarius,"Are you an open book? Sometimes it’s smart to be that way, other times it’s not…which is something that ancient astrologers were keenly aware of. Today is a good time to think about just how much information you put out there about yourself. If in doubt, don’t say it.

"
5487,22 may 2018,aquarius,"If you’ve been considering a side hustle (or you’ve already got one going) today is a good time for taking things to the next level. Home based businesses are especially strong for Aquarians these days, and this includes a day job that enables you to work out of the house a few days a week.

"
5488,23 may 2018,aquarius,"Wishful thinking isn’t going to get you anywhere, Aquarius. You may have some interesting day dreams going on, but a well structured life is built on a strong foundation. Build that first, then go after the extras.

"
5489,24 may 2018,aquarius,"You’ve got charisma in spades, so work it, Aquarius! Now’s the perfect time to show off your image, ideas and talent. Don’t worry about what others think; with next week’s full moon occurring in your house of networking, the time is ripe for impressing other people. 

"
5490,25 may 2018,aquarius,"Balancing logic and creativity are a snap thanks to an unusual Jupiter-Neptune trine. The best part is that you can harness this energy to make more money, always a blessing. They say that fortune favors the bold, but with this aspect it also favors those who can think out of the box.

"
5491,26 may 2018,aquarius,"Keep your personal business to yourself, Aquarius. Romantic matters, family issues and housing decisions don’t need to be discussed with everyone out there. Your own personal wisdom is strong—don’t be afraid to tap into it.

"
5492,27 may 2018,aquarius,"It’s the weekend and you may want to play, but your chart suggests that you need to get caught up on some grunt work. You can justify procrastinating in all sorts of ways, but in the end the chores will still be there. So why not get it over and done with now?

"
5493,28 may 2018,aquarius,"Your sign is known for its friendly spirit, and today’s full moon falls in your house of networking and meeting new people! No matter how much you love your tribe, the cosmos is telling you to shake things up a bit. Seek out people who enjoy the same hobbies or sports that you do and start sharing experiences with them too.

"
5494,29 may 2018,aquarius,"Aligning yourself with people who share your values and dreams becomes easier with today’s full moon in the most friendly part of your chart! It’s also a great time to plan some networking events and parties, or to attend some interesting soirees. Your life could use a reboot: find people with a sense of adventure.

"
5495,30 may 2018,aquarius,"Just because someone is a friend or treated colleague doesn’t mean that they need to hear all the details about your life. Nor do you need to go in with them on their latest escapade. Pull away if you need to and wait for this to pass.

"
5496,31 may 2018,aquarius,"It should be easier to get to the bottom of what’s bothering you as a cathartic Saturn-Moon aspect is in the heavens. Your relationships with other people are a big focus these days, and wise Saturn will help you smooth things over.

"
5497,2 june 2018,aquarius,"Give yourself a break, Aquarius! According to your chart you’ve been pushing yourself too hard. With gentle Venus in the house of health care, it’s time for some overdue pampering. True, you probably should eat better and exercise, but this weekend it’s all about taking things easy.

"
5498,3 june 2018,aquarius,"Anyone who thinks they can talk their way around you is in for a big surprise! You’re the one with the gift of gab, creative expression and outright flirting. So work it, because the cosmos is dousing you with magnetism.

"
5499,4 june 2018,aquarius,"Love and family matters can often be confusing, but today your vision is 20/20 when it comes to these topics. A highly practical Sun-Mercury aspect is just the ticket for seeing what’s really going on. Wait until Tuesday the 16th to start laying down some new rules.

"
5500,5 june 2018,aquarius,"Aquarians are famous for being team players, but that goes out the window today with a stinky Venus-Pluto opposition. Every cell in your body may rebel against going along with the crowd or cooperating in some way. Whether you can afford to do this or not is a other story!

"
5501,6 june 2018,aquarius,"Creative people like to brag about how they love to break the rules. But sometimes you can tap into your talents much better if you follow a certain discipline, something that the cosmos is telling you right now. First figure out how to do things the right way—then  break the rules.

"
5502,7 june 2018,aquarius,"Spending on swag and entertainment may sound like a good idea, but the cosmos warns against it. Do you really need a $15 martini or a $1000 It Bag? Hold off on spending for now. More spending days lie ahead; save for now.

"
5503,8 june 2018,aquarius,"Feeling like a social butterfly? You should be with the Moon in your house of partying! But don’t feel too free and easy, telling everyone your private business. Subterranean Pluto warns that you could spill too much intel.

"
5504,9 june 2018,aquarius,"Your sign is so open and free that you don’t stoop to passive-aggressive games. But others do, and you need to protect yourself from their machinations. Steer clear of anyone who gives you a funny vibe.

"
5505,10 june 2018,aquarius,"It’s a good day to get your house in order, Aquarius, so spend some time decluttering. Once energetic Mercury enters the most productive part of your chart on Tuesday, you’ll be even more determined to live a more streamlined life. The less mess, the less stress….and the more serenity you’ll enjoy.

"
5506,11 june 2018,aquarius,"Nervous much? From your chart it appears that you’re worried about what others think of you, especially bosses, parents, key clients or people in positions of authority. But this is just your imagination. They actually have a high opinion of you, so stop being so paranoid!

"
5507,12 june 2018,aquarius,"Your productivity goes through the roof now that Mercury is in your house of getting things done! Over the next few weeks you should be actively searching for hacks and better systems that will streamline your life, both at home and at work. This is also an awesome time to get in shape by creating new diet and fitness habits….and sticking with them.

"
5508,13 june 2018,aquarius,"Tonight’s new moon has a double dose of good luck, Aquarius! It occurs in your house of romance (finding new love, enhancing an existing relationship). And at the same time, amorous Venus glides into your house of commitment. Can you say “I do”? The next few months are fabulous for matters of the heart.

"
5509,14 june 2018,aquarius,"A loved one may act out today, catching you off guard. Unpredictable Uranus is in a snit and making people somewhat defensive and argumentative. Fortunately, peacemaker Venus is in the most diplomatic part of your chart, so you should be able to sail through this tempest in a teapot.

"
5510,15 june 2018,aquarius,"What people say and what they mean may be two different things today, Aquarius. It’s not that they’re trying to deceive you; they actually think that their ideas are on point. But they may not have thought things through well enough, something that your razor sharp intuition will pick up on.

"
5511,16 june 2018,aquarius,"Getting your financial life in order is on the cosmos’ agenda for your sign, and from the looks of it you need to develop better habits. Start going through your statements now, and while you’re at it consider new ways to earn more. A side hustle could be the way to go.

"
5512,17 june 2018,aquarius,"There is no room in your life for bad habits and inefficient systems and people. The planets are asking you to clean up your own act, and then take a look at other people in your world who are creating too much chaos. Pull it together now–or deal with the drama and stress later.

"
5513,18 june 2018,aquarius,"Over the next few months it’s critical to be on top of your finances, now that murky Neptune is retrograde in your house of income and budgeting. Start be developing better saving habits, then start considering new ways of earning more.

"
5514,19 june 2018,aquarius,"Get outta my way! That’s the Aquarius battle cry as practical Mercury puts you in a mood to get things done. There’s no room in your life for slackers or inefficient systems. You can make a lot of progress, so create a short list of things (or people!) who are holding you back.

"
5515,20 june 2018,aquarius,"Getting a handle on your health and fitness is a snap with today’s Mercury-Neptune connection. Mercury is all about doing things the smart way, and glamorous Neptune is in the wellness sector. Creating better habits (and sticking to them) is a real possibility, so even if you fell off the wagon before, you can get back on it.

"
5516,21 june 2018,aquarius,"Just how good are your habits and systems, Aquarius? If they need improvement you now have the chance to take care of things. That’s because the Sun just entered your house of efficiency, the place where we clean up our acts—at the office, at home and also with our bodies! That’s right, getting fit will be the name of the game over the next 4 weeks. Home gyms are favored in your chart, so consider one.

"
5517,22 june 2018,aquarius,"Family members may be surprisingly cooperative over the next few days, so now’s a good time to rope them in to getting things done around the house! It’s also an auspicious moment for settling battles. With next week’s full moon arriving in your house of closure, you’re in the mood for putting things behind you.

"
5518,23 june 2018,aquarius,"Your logical mind is battling your intuition today–which one will win? From the looks of your chart, I’d say to pay closer attention to your gut than your mind. This energy will repeat itself on Wednesday, so be prepared to operate on a vibey level.

"
5519,24 june 2018,aquarius,"Sometimes we have to take a good long look at what we’ve got going on in our lives and assess them. If anything or anyone is simply too much effort or trouble, then it may be time to move on. You can only focus on so many things at a time.

"
5520,25 june 2018,aquarius,"From your chart it appears that you just want some peace and quiet in a relationship, dammit! And a sense of stability wouldn’t hurt either. However, the people around you may not be coming from a chill or diplomatic place. Once Mercury changes signs on Friday you’ll be able to communicate your needs to them.

"
5521,26 june 2018,aquarius,"What’s most important to you,  Aquarius? With energetic Mars now retrograding in your sign, it’s time to stop traveling at warp speed and take a breather. The full moon on Thursday is the best time in 2018 for you to do some serious thinking in solitude.

"
5522,27 june 2018,aquarius,"You have certain standards that you don’t want to bend, but don’t make a big deal about it. As a matter of fact you’re better off keeping that information to yourself. If others know where you’re coming from they might try to sway you to their way of thinking.

"
5523,28 june 2018,aquarius,"You may have completely had it with playing by the rules, and tonight’s full moon could make that painfully obvious. But it also appears that you could benefit from creating some better habits and routines. Create your own rules and live by them—you can’t go wrong that way.

"
5524,29 june 2018,aquarius,"You’re currently in a bit of a weird place astrologically speaking: on the one hand, you’re craving solitude, and on the other hand you need to mix with people. Mercury just entered one of the most diplomatic, cooperative parts of your chart. Balance “me” time with “people” time and you’ll be fine.

"
5525,30 june 2018,aquarius,"Feeling like the only logical person in your family? From your chart it sure looks that way! They could be more than ready to push your buttons, so if you want a quiet weekend, pull away from them if possible. Your best bet is to let them figure things out for themselves.

"
5526,1 july 2018,aquarius,"You’re on the right track and you know what you’re doing. So don’t pay attention to people who are trying to tell you otherwise, no matter how well meaning they are. That said, you still need to cooperate, so do your own thing and say little about it.

"
5527,3 july 2018,aquarius,"Your career is picking up steam, thanks to generous Jupiter creating some terrific aspects now and through next week. Practicality and logic count more than crazy ideas, so think creatively yet rationally.

"
5528,4 july 2018,aquarius,"Big plans of yours are going to start to develop momentum next week, so if you’re smart you’ll start recharging your batteries right now. The problem is that you can’t seem to walk away from your responsibilities. Don’t worry, the world won’t collapse if you take a day off.

"
5529,5 july 2018,aquarius,"Impressing higher-ups is a snap thanks to a positive Sun-Jupiter aspect. Also, if you’re planning on moving forward with a big plan start doing the grunt work on it now. Things will take pff rapidly due to next week’s solar eclipse.

"
5530,6 july 2018,aquarius,"Assertive Mars is in your sign, possible making you fierce and independent—perhaps too much so for other people. Be careful to not offend people whose help you may need in the future.

"
5531,7 july 2018,aquarius,"Need to hide from your family today? That could be the case with erratic Uranus acting up in your domestic sector. Of course, if someone needs your help you should be there for them. But otherwise, steer clear of known divas and malcontents. With so much activity in your goals sector you really need to look out for number one.

"
5532,8 july 2018,aquarius,"Everyone knows that Aquarians are true team players. The problem, of course, is not everyone else wants to be part of a team! Fortunately a potent Neptune aspect today helps you rally people around. You may need to create new roles for people and change the rules of the game a bit, but everything should work out well.

"
5533,9 july 2018,aquarius,"Ready to score some serious dinero? In astrology, there are two planets that govern profitability. One is Venus, which enters your net worth sector today. The other is Jupiter, which goes direct in your ambition sector tomorrow. This is one of the best times all year to start earning more, so start hustling.

"
5534,10 july 2018,aquarius,"Your life is about to take a quantum leap forward, Aquarius. Jupiter, which has been retrograde in your house of goals, finally resumes direct motion. This is wonderful news for those of you whose plans have been stalled. But even more energy arrives on Friday, when a solar eclipse occurs in your house of efficiency and getting things done. Hope you’re well rested!

"

"
5538,14 july 2018,aquarius,"Your most hidden dreams and desires get pushed to center front stage today. Things that you thought would never happen, or ideas that you thought were fantasies may actually have the chance to manifest. Yesterday’s solar eclipse has put you in a practical frame of mind, to start taking action on some of your deepest desires.

"
5539,15 july 2018,aquarius,"Got a lot of emotions building up inside of you? Then today’s a smart time to let them out. Spontaneous Uranus is active in your house of contentment and security. Holding things in won’t serve anyone, especially you.

"
5540,16 july 2018,aquarius,"Psychologists say that there is a difference between happiness and contentment. Happiness is a state that comes from external things coming your way. Contentment, on the other hand, is an internal feeling that travels with you no matter what is going on in your life. Today is the perfect time to examine just what makes you happy and what you need to be truly content.

"
5541,17 july 2018,aquarius,"Stop beating yourself up, Aquarius! From your chart it appears that you’re being self-critical about the things that you say and how you present yourself. This passes quickly. By the time the weekend rolls around, the Moon will be in a much better place to make you feel authoritative again.

"
5544,20 july 2018,aquarius,"It’s time to push yourself past previous boundaries, and with brilliant Neptune in action, you should go for it! Currently you have a number of planets in a traditional mood, but the time is ripe for breaking with tradition.

"
5545,21 july 2018,aquarius,"With a lunar eclipse occurring in one week’s time in your sign, you should be wrapping up initiatives that are important to you.

But the upcoming lunar eclipse in Aquarius this Friday is lighting a fire under you to have things done your way.

"
5547,23 july 2018,aquarius,"How you spend your time and energy is important, Aquarius. So is who you spend it with. Don’t waste your precious life and emotions on people or situations that don’t fill you with joy. This Friday’s eclipse is the perfect time to close out things from the past.

"
5548,24 july 2018,aquarius,"A fool and their money are soon parted, Aquarius. That’s an old saying but it certainly applies to you today. Luxe-loving Venus and deceptive Neptune are at war today in financial houses. Don’t succumb to the allure of putting everything on plastic. Save your money for a rainy day.

"
5549,25 july 2018,aquarius,"Ignoring problems won’t make them go away, Aquarius. You may suddenly realize today that you have to take action on some of these issues. Your personal serenity and comfort depend upon it.

"
5550,26 july 2018,aquarius,"Are you surrounded by the right kind of people, Aquarius? That’s the question that the cosmos asks of you as Mercury begins to retrograde in Leo. Friday’s lunar eclipse occurs in your sign, making you all the more aware of your own needs. It’s one thing to be diplomatic and cooperative; it’s another to give up who you are for other people.
 

"
5551,27 july 2018,aquarius,"Go ahead and take a bow, Aquarius! Today’s lunar eclipse occurs in your sign. Something that is very important to you may come to a successful conclusion, either over the next few days or over the next few months. Patience matters right now.

"
5556,1 august 2018,aquarius,"People could push your buttons today, and chances are you won’t be too happy about it.With aggressive Mars in your sign, you could lash out against anyone who goes up against you. This is especially true if you perceive that your security is being threatened. But is it really? By Saturday you’ll be feeling a heck of a lot better.

"
5557,2 august 2018,aquarius,"This is a good day to show decision-makers that you have what it takes, Aquarius. You are able to juggle a lot at one time, something that has been noticed. Your ability to multitask could result in a new position and higher pay.

"
5561,6 august 2018,aquarius,"First the good news: Venus is now in the most freethinking, optimistic part of your chart. You are ready for some new adventures, which could include travel, study or entrepreneurship. Now for the less exciting part: people around you may feel like clipping your wings. Are you going to allow them to do that? Hell, no!

"
5562,7 august 2018,aquarius,"Over the past few months you may have felt confined by the expectations of people in your world. This is especially true of family members and a lover. Now that independent Uranus is spinning backwards in your domestic sector, you will be feeling less rebellious. But this doesn’t mean that you’re going to give in to the demands of others! You’ll just be less annoyed about it.

"
5563,9 august 2018,aquarius,"Just how much independence do you need… and how much comfort? That’s the question today as Venus is pitted against Saturn. If you’re smart, you’ll find a good balance between the two.

"
5564,10 august 2018,aquarius,"You need to do a lot of thinking about the people you are partnering with. This is true in your personal life as well as your business one. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse occurs in your house of long-term relationships. You need team players, not someone who is going to boss you around.

This retrograde period ends on the 27th, so you have about two weeks to do some important work.

"
5567,13 august 2018,aquarius,"Just because something glitters doesn’t mean that it’s made of gold! This holds true of people, job offers and anything else that may catch your fancy today. If something or someone appeals to you, wait twenty-four hours before you make your move.

A positive Venus aspect today indicates that you can move mountains without breaking a sweat. Consider how you can simplify things and take a much easier road than killing yourself all the time.

"

"
5578,24 august 2018,aquarius,"Your intuition should be working overtime, thanks to the Moon and Mars blasting through the house of your subconscious mind.

There could be an “aha” moment when everything becomes crystal clear. And with wise Saturn in your house of healing, now’s the time to let this stuff go.
 

"
5580,26 august 2018,aquarius,"Ready to cash in? The full moon in Pisces could bring a new job offer, promotion or revenue stream your way. But it’s imperative that you carefully vet any promises made, such as bonuses or commission dollars. If you’re self-employed double check your projections.

"
5583,29 august 2018,aquarius,"Need to gain greater control of a situation? Then the best way to pull that off is by pulling back. Work behind the scenes. Say little. Don’t show all of your cards. And don’t let anyone tell you that this is sneaky; this is cosmos-approved smart strategy.

"
5584,30 august 2018,aquarius,"Trying to talk sense to people probably will go nowhere due to a Moon-Venus opposition. And so will trying to explain the bigger picture or a grand vision. You’re better off keeping your opinions to yourself and let others figure things out on their own.

"
5585,31 august 2018,aquarius,"A solution to a personal problem may appear from out of the blue, and if you’re smart, you’ll run with it. This is especially true of family matters or a situation within a love relationship. You may need to bend a little bit, but the end result will be worth it.

"
5591,6 september 2018,aquarius,"You have been going through a period of deep inner healing, Aquarius. Subterranean Pluto an mature Saturn have both been retrograde in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. As a result you may have been releasing a lot of mental junk that you no longer need. The good news is that Saturn goes direct today, and any good habits and thought patterns that you created should stick.

"
5592,7 september 2018,aquarius,"Your prospects are improving on the two fronts that people tend to care about the most: love and money! Shrewd Mercury will help you uncover some wise investments or business deals. Independent Uranus will let you express yourself freely in matters of the heart, or to find someone new.

"
5600,18 september 2018,aquarius,"Don’t fall prey to somebody else’s tantrums or guilt trips, Aquarius. With assertive Mars in your sign, you may be tempted to blast them with both barrels.

The only problem you’ll have to face is figuring out which juicy idea (or person!) to pursue first. Once you get going , it’s possible that fears or concerns will pop up.

Tonight’s full moon occurs in the part of your chart that deals with the way you think and express yourself. Networking with other people, brainstorming and promoting are all very strong right now.

"
5614,2 october 2018,aquarius,"They say that knowledge is power. And I would have to agree that that is a true statement. But the smart Aquarius keeps their knowledge to themselves today. A Mercury-Pluto square indicates that people will either be unwilling to listen to your wisdom, or they may steal your ideas and run with them.

5732,4 april 2018,pisces,"Egos could spiral out of control, especially within a group or team. Trying to talk sense to people could be useless, so don’t waste your time. You’re not their therapist or whipping boy/girl.

"
5733,5 april 2018,pisces,"As our circumstances change in life, so do our values. Why continue to go through your days with a set of values or dreams that no longer suits who you’ve become? From your chart it appears that you may decide to simplify by cutting back on commitments and connections.

"
5734,6 april 2018,pisces,"What really motivates you, Pisces? You might be surprised what your true desires are, if you dig deep enough. What other people think about your ideas is meaningless. Become obsessed with your dreams if that’s what it takes.

"
5735,7 april 2018,pisces,"Being a team player is important over the next few weeks, but that doesn’t mean that you have to sell out at the same time. Stick to your principles, speak your mind and honor the ideas that others espouse.

"
5736,8 april 2018,pisces,"Get rid of people who don’t support your dreams and surround yourself with people who do. Life is too short to kowtow to selfish people or to worry about keeping them happy.

"
5737,9 april 2018,pisces,"Be careful about the people with whom you entrust confidential information, Pisces. Not everyone is on the up and up. It could also be that someone’s throwing shade, so keep your ear to the ground.

"
5738,10 april 2018,pisces,"Give ’em an inch and they’ll take a mile! Unless you want everyone dumping their duties and problems on you, you’ll need to set some boundaries. Don’t feel guilty about it either; it’s not your job in life to be their enabler.

"
5739,11 april 2018,pisces,"Men are from Mars and women are from Venus, so they say, but today those two planets are in a fabulous angle. Which means that you could meet a new flame, get on the same page with a lover or enjoy a fabulous night out on the town.

"
5740,12 april 2018,pisces,"Awww!!! Feeling all warm and mushy? Could be with a sweet Venus-Neptune aspect! Hell, even if you woke up today feeling as mean as a snake, it’s time to spit out the venom. Stop taking life so seriously and treat yourself well instead.

"
5742,14 april 2018,pisces,"No man or woman is an island and from your chart it appears that you should be expanding your contact list. Make an effort to meet new people in both your personal and professional life. This will become even easier after the Sun enters Taurus on the 20th.

"
5743,15 april 2018,pisces,"Show me the money! Mercury has been retrograde in your income sector but stations direct today. Things usually take a few days to pick up speed once a planet goes direct, but a new moon tomorrow in this sector means that momentum will develop quickly. Get ready to see more green.

"
5744,16 april 2018,pisces,"The cosmos provides each sign with one new moon every year in their income zone, and yours is today. Over the next few months you can make some big changes in your career or business, pulling in more cash and saving it. But before you get started, it would be wise to do some thinking about your core values. Align them with your career plans if you want to be happy. Money isn’t everything!

"
5745,17 april 2018,pisces,"Finding people who will be by your side over the long run is important right now, Pisces. Wise old Saturn retrogrades in your house of friends, pointing out the ties that should be cut and introducing you to some interesting new people. Saturn is all about success over the long term, so the decisions you make carry weight.

"
5746,18 april 2018,pisces,"Mercury is now direct in your income zone, and today you could hit upon an absolutely amazing idea for making more money. It could happen fast and the idea might at first seem ludicrous. But use some logic and get to work on it, as this has legs.

"
5747,19 april 2018,pisces,"People around you seem to be in need, Pisces. They need attention or wisdom or maybe just a shoulder to cry on. Give them what you can, as it will be appreciated deeply. Not to mention it’s good karma!

"
5748,20 april 2018,pisces,"A lively, social time opens up thanks to the Sun entering Taurus, your house of self-expression! This is the best time all year to meet new people and party will your pals. It’s also perfect for putting your thoughts and words out there: your resume, thesis, marketing or sales campaign, manuscript, blog or podcast. Other people may be unreliable, though, so expect delays.

"
5749,21 april 2018,pisces,"FOMO and other little pangs of jealousy could erupt today, either at your end or on the part of a friend or lover. Jealousy is a completely useless emotion, only creating unhappiness within the person experiencing it.

Put yourself in places where you will be seen.

"
5751,23 april 2018,pisces,"The dynamics of a group may need to be adjusted, whether it’s within your family, friends or a team at the office.

"
5752,24 april 2018,pisces,"The comforts of home will be calling your name now that Venus is in your house of nesting. But a full moon is coming in your house of long distance travel, too! Who says that you can’t do both?

"
5753,25 april 2018,pisces,"People may not be thinking rationally, which could create turmoil within a group’s dynamics. Trying to talk sense to them won’t work, so don’t bother. Not today, anyhow. Tomorrow is a much better day to get everyone back in agreement, although you may need to be cracking the whip!

"
5754,26 april 2018,pisces,"Remember that old corny saying, “there is no ‘I’ in the word “team’”? Keep it in mind over the next few days, as you run the risk of being way too pushy in group efforts. This may not be a bad thing if you need to whip a team into shape. But otherwise you might make enemies if you come on too strong.

"
5755,27 april 2018,pisces,"Sometimes it gets pretty boring and conservative doing everything by the book, but hey, it’s often the smartest way to go. And today is one of those days.

"
5757,29 april 2018,pisces,"The planets are encouraging you to take more chances in life, and that includes making new connections. But don’t be too quick to join forces with someone just because they show up in your environment. Make sure that these people think the way you do, like the same kinds of activities and know how to have a good time! If you’re the shy type, seek out friends who will pull you out of your shell.

"
5758,30 april 2018,pisces,"If your gut has been telling you to take a chance, there’s a good reason! Tonight’s full moon in your optimistic, free wheeling house of adventure is spurring you to break out of an old routine.

"
5759,1 may 2018,pisces,"The full moon in Scorpio yesterday is lighting a fire under you to bust out of an old groove and take some chances. But Uranus is freaking out from your house of stability and income. The message is this: don’t take any chances that could put your financial situation at risk. Finding new friends, making yourself over, and studying different philosophies or religions are all non-risky chances to take!

"
5760,2 may 2018,pisces,"Family members and close connections could get a little pushy today, and you may simply not have the energy to deal with it.

"
5763,5 may 2018,pisces,"Your sign is not known for kissing up, but a little flattery could get you everywhere. From your chart it appears that you could connect with movers and shakers, people who can help you travel faster on your journey. Find them, introduce yourself and develop relationships with them.

"
5764,6 may 2018,pisces,"People often accuse your sign of being indirect or downright flaky, but they don’t really get you, do they? Today is perfect for getting your point across without being demanding. Actually, you can be downright slick!

"
5765,7 may 2018,pisces,"The flatterers and connivers will be out in force, so keep your hand on your wallet and your ego in check. Otherwise you’ll be easy prey for those who are only looking out for their own selfish agendas.

"
5766,8 may 2018,pisces,"Be a straight shooter today, Pisces. Don’t leave any doubt in someone’s mind what you’re thinking or planning to do.

"
5767,9 may 2018,pisces,"A stellar Moon-Saturn aspect is helpful for meeting new people who could make a big difference in your life. This entire year is well aspected for expanding your contact list, but there are special days when it’s even easier. Today is one of them. Enjoy!

"
5768,10 may 2018,pisces,"People often accuse your sign of being too day dreamy, but what the hell do they know? A luscious lunar aspect gives you permission to dream big. Tomorrow you might want to share your ideas with others, as Pluto is in an excellent spot from your house of friends and teamwork.

"
5769,11 may 2018,pisces,"Start surrounding yourself with movers and shakers, Pisces. The company you keep will be ultra-important over the next eight years. Today a stellar Sun-Pluto aspect can introduce you to people who can open up some pretty interesting doors.

"
5770,12 may 2018,pisces,"Avoid group think today, as the tribe could lead you astray. It’s wiser to march to the beat of your own drum, Pisces. With shrewd Mercury in a logical place, you’ll know what’s right and what is wrong.

Brilliant Uranus is now in your house of self-expression, making your sign the one to listen to. Between now and 2026 you can start a blog, write a screenplay (and see it turned into a movie), become a teacher, socialize like crazy, develop your artistic talents or hit the public speaking circuit. Don’t hold back!

"
5774,16 may 2018,pisces,"Now that bold Uranus is in the most outspoken part of your chart, chances are you’ll want to go loud and proud. And a new moon is only adding fuel to this fire. But Mars enters your hush-hush house of confidentiality tomorrow, warning that you keep some things to yourself.

5775,17 may 2018,pisces,"Ouch! Don’t speak your mind today as the backlash could be intense. Yes, you’re entitled to your opinions and yes, you may be smarter than others. But revealing too much could end up harming you. Sometimes silence is the best way to operate.

"
5776,18 may 2018,pisces,"It’s time to tell your tribe what’s on your mind, Pisces. This could be your family, friends, a department at work or some other team that you’re part of.

"
5779,21 may 2018,pisces,"There are always smarter ways to do things and there is always someone out there who knows how to do it.

"
5782,24 may 2018,pisces,"This is one of the best days all year to find serenity, Pisces. The other eleven signs think that you have this down pat, but the reality is that you struggle with fears and negative emotions just like everyone else. Find a modality that works for you: journaling, therapy, mindfulness, sports, hobbies—whatever gets you centered and feeling at ease.

"
5783,25 may 2018,pisces,"Yowza! What an amazing day to take what seems (to others) to be a crazy-ass idea, and to do something amazing with it! With profitable Jupiter in the sector that deals with entrepreneurship, the news media and global reach, you shouldn’t hesitate to boldly head off in a new direction. Let people say that you’re nuts; you’ll end up having the last laugh.

"
5784,26 may 2018,pisces,"Gotta love it when the weekend is here and the planets are telling you to get out there and socialize.

"
5785,27 may 2018,pisces,"Wishful thinking might take over, especially when it comes to your personal relationships. Make sure that you’re not putting someone on a pedestal or trusting them too much.

"
5788,30 may 2018,pisces,"The full moon just fell in your house of ambition…so why are you sitting there, afraid to make a fresh move? Blame it on a Moon-Neptune aspect that is undermining your confidence. One of the smartest things that you can do is talk to a trusted mentor or friend.

"
5789,31 may 2018,pisces,"Your idea as to what’s important is changing, Pisces. Values that may have seemed so important just a short time ago are now up for review. Feeling comfortable in your own skin and within your relationships is what it’s all about right now.

And if you feel as though you don’t have the answers, you are blessed with a calm wisdom that and confidence that people will look up to. It’s time to help others who need some direction.

"
5791,2 june 2018,pisces,"They say that “if you can dream it, you can do it”—but is that really true? From your chart it certainly looks that way! A winning trine between Venus and Neptune provides you with tons of creative inspiration. Don’t worry right now if your ideas seem crazy. You’ll have time to vet them.

"
5792,3 june 2018,pisces,"You’re a vibey soul and today’s cosmic energy is going to increase your mental mojo. Mars and the Moon are hard at work, stirring up your psyche. Pay close attention to gut hunches, seemingly crazy ideas (they may not be!) and your dreams too.

"
5793,4 june 2018,pisces,"No one can push our buttons like family and loved ones, right? But you’re nobody’s fool, not with a shrewd meet-up of the Sun and Mercury in the domestic part of your chart. Call people out on their behavior. They may put up resistance, but too bad. When you’re right, you’re right!

"
5794,5 june 2018,pisces,"Finger pointing could be all around you as a Pluto-Venus opposition stirs up drama and jealousy. Do you really want to be a part of this scene? If not, hibernate over the next 48 hours until the pissy people calm down.

"
5795,6 june 2018,pisces,"Family and loved ones working your nerves? That could be the case with a strenuous Mercury-Neptune aspect. If you can, pull away from their dramas for the next few days.

"
5796,7 june 2018,pisces,"You could be feeling quite sensitive due to today’s Sun-Neptune square. But are the things you’re worrying about really true? When the Moon enters the most intuitive part of your chart tomorrow, you’ll be able to see things more clearly.

"
5797,8 june 2018,pisces,"Keep your opinions to yourself this weekend, Pisces. With the Moon in the most perceptive part of your chart you could pick up a lot of hidden clues, but that doesn’t mean that you should voice what you’re thinking.

"
5800,11 june 2018,pisces,"Same old, same old! The planets are urging you to shake up your routine, and one of the best ways to do so is to take a trip out of town.

"
5801,12 june 2018,pisces,"Which is ruling your world—your heart or your head? That’s going to be the big question over the next few weeks, Pisces. Today logical Mercury glides into your house of romance, and tomorrow touchy-feely Venus enters your house of practicality. Fortunately this won’t be a raging battle but a gentle tug-of-war.

"
5802,13 june 2018,pisces,"Getting your life in order is what you should be thinking about these days, Pisces. The new moon takes place in your domestic sector, encouraging you to beautify and organize your home. Venus enters your efficiency sector too, adding to the Martha Stewart vibe.

"
5803,14 june 2018,pisces,"Avoid control freaks today as they will be in the mood for trying to boss everyone around. This could be at the office or within your personal life, so head for cover. Over the weekend a friend or lover could be acting this way: ignore them, as next Tuesday brings happier energy.

"
5804,15 june 2018,pisces,"Don’t feel as though you have to play by other peoples’ rules, Pisces. Others may be trying to force their opinions or values on you, which will only make you rebel. When your ruler, Neptune, goes retrograde next week you’ll have the chance to consider what’s truly important to you.

"
5805,16 june 2018,pisces,"Enjoying life more is the name of the game with the Sun getting ready to enter the most fun-filled part of your chart.

"
5806,17 june 2018,pisces,"Your ruler, Neptune, is about to go retrograde, which means that now is a good time to get clear on anything that has been troubling you. If you can’t get a handle on things quickly, don’t worry. Once the Sun enters Cancer on Thursday creative solutions will appear.

"
5808,19 june 2018,pisces,"Ready to take a chance in love? The cosmos sure is! Lucky Jupiter (in your house of adventure) is winking at Mercury (in the romance zone). Go ahead….do it! Tell someone that you love them. Ask that person out. Try a new type. Schedule a romantic vacation with your amour. Life’s too short to do things the old, comfortable way.

"
5809,20 june 2018,pisces,"Neptune has just retrograded in your sign, making you question all of the areas of your life. Today the watery planet forms a helpful aspect with intelligent Mercury in your house of romance. Consider what you need to make your love life happier, steamier and more fun. It takes two to tango, of course, but are you tangoing with the right person?

"
5810,21 june 2018,pisces,"Dramatic scenes might ensue now that the Sun is in the most flamboyant part of your chart. Love could become a lot friskier and enjoyable too, as long as you don’t let jealousy and other useless emotions run the show. The next four weeks are also super for creative types, so put in some time at the studio.

"
5811,22 june 2018,pisces,"What a wonderful day (and weekend) to be spontaneous! Lively Uranus, planet of the unpredictable, is in one heck of a good mood.

"
5812,23 june 2018,pisces,"Pleasing everyone could be a difficult task this weekend…so why bother? The people who truly appreciate you won’t go against you, but others might. That’s OK! The full moon next week falls in your house of friends, so if anyone is too much of a problem, just say adios.

"
5814,25 june 2018,pisces,"Nitpicky much? Either you or someone else could be hell bent on finding fault or focusing on stuff that doesn’t matter. With Mars about to retrograde in your house of the subconscious mind, you’ll be able to take a good long look at whoever is doing this and figure out why it’s going on. If you’re the culprit, it’s time for some inner work.

"
5815,26 june 2018,pisces,"Your subconscious mind is now in overdrive, thanks to Mars going retrograde in this part of your chart. But that doesn’t mean that your intuition is on target. On the contrary…you may be dreaming up scenarios that are completely off base. Think before you speak or act.

"
5816,27 june 2018,pisces,"The entire free world doesn’t need to know what you’re up to, so keep some things to yourself. Otherwise friends or colleagues could start meddling way too much in your affairs. It may also be time to meet some new people, so be open to folks who are more worldly and wise.

"
5817,28 june 2018,pisces,"Some kind of group activity could come to a successful finale thanks to tonights full moon in Capricorn.

Don’t let them spoil the success of whatever it is you’re working on.

"

"
5819,30 june 2018,pisces,"Someone may try to upset your carefully laid out plans, but don’t give them that opportunity. Perhaps they disagree with your approach. Or maybe they fear that you’ll succeed. Either way, keep calm and carry on.

"
5820,1 july 2018,pisces,"It’s always helpful when people share the same dreams and values as you, and from your chart it appears that greater cooperation is on the way. This is true in both your personal and professional lives, so extend the olive branch and expect others to do the same.

"
5821,3 july 2018,pisces,"So what’s your point? Don’t be afraid of speaking your mind today, even if you think that your ideas may be a little “out there”. Some of your crazy notions might actually be quite workable, so give them the time and attention they deserve.

"

"
5824,6 july 2018,pisces,"You may need to set some boundaries with someone who’s pushing it, Pisces. The issue is that this person may be acting behind the scenes or in a passive-aggressive way. Confronting them probably won’t work, but you can figure out a more subtle way for dealing with their nonsense.

"
5825,7 july 2018,pisces,"Both your mind and your mouth could be quite active today, Pisces! This means that you need to think before you speak. That said, you can have a great time chatting with friends and socializing. This is the perfect weekend to be spontaneous, which also includes going on a quick getaway.

"
5826,8 july 2018,pisces,"If you’ve got it, flaunt it, Pisces! A stellar Neptune aspect ramps up your charisma. This is also wonderful day to switch up your look, such as changing your hairstyle or trying a new fashion look. Once Jupiter goes direct on Tuesday you are going to be in the public eye a lot more,  so you might as well look devastating in the process.

"
5827,9 july 2018,pisces,"It’s a close relationship has been stuck, it’s about to develop momentum. That’s because Venus enters your house of committed relationships today. This includes professional as well as personal unions. Over the next three weeks, you can resolve problems from the past and move on to a much more liberated and optimistic place.

"
5828,10 july 2018,pisces,"People who think that you are the dreamy, quiet type are in for big surprise, Pisces. Jupiter resumes direct motion in your house of adventure today, opening doors to some exciting new possibilities! And then on Friday there is a solar eclipse in your house of creativity, drama and fun. There’s going to be no holding you back. Expect people to be sitting on the job on the sidelines with their jaws hanging open.

"
5829,11 july 2018,pisces,"Can we talk? The lines of communication open wide as spontaneous Uranus is in the mood for conversation. You can especially make progress in some of your closest connections. Don’t be afraid to verbalize some of your deepest thoughts.

"
5830,12 july 2018,pisces,"First, the good news. Tomorrow’s a solar eclipse occurs in your house of romance and fun! Now for the disclaimer. Pluto is in a stinky mood from the other side of the heavens. Friends, colleagues or mentors may not be on board with some of the fun ideas that you have in mind. It’s one thing to take advice from these people; it’s another to let them control your life.

"
5831,13 july 2018,pisces,"Sweet! A sizzling solar eclipse kicks open doors in your romance department. More fun, flirting and creativity lie ahead over the next six months. But it’s imperative that you do your own thing. Friends, colleagues and mentors may have a problem with some of the ideas that are popping in your brain. Remember, it’s your life and you deserve to live it your way.

"
5832,14 july 2018,pisces,"A spirit of greater cooperation fills the air with a helpful Venus aspect. Now is the time to open up and let people know exactly what you’re thinking. Long term plans depend on it.

"
5833,15 july 2018,pisces,"You’re in quite an outspoken mood these days, Pisces. In the week ahead there are good days for speaking out, and days that aren’t so great. Fortunately, today is auspicious for speaking your mind. To your surprise people may be very interested in what you have to say, and willing to work with you.

"
5834,17 july 2018,pisces,"It’s not your karma and life to stay stuck in a job that you can’t stand, or to earn less than what you deserve. When the Sun enters Leo on Sunday, a four week period opens in which you can make changes to your employment status. A new gig may seem like a lateral move at first, but it actually holds promise.

"
5835,18 july 2018,pisces,"You may already be feeling the effects of the lunar eclipse that is arriving on July 27th. It falls in your house of closure, and today is a smart time to make an assessment of things and people in your life that need to go. You’re going to be quite practical about this, not worrying about the fallout.

"
5836,19 july 2018,pisces,"You’re in the mood to take some risks, but do you really need to tell everybody about it? It’s smarter to ponder your next move without broadcasting your ideas to everyone. Next week’s lunar eclipse will be a great moment to silently go after your dreams.

"
5837,20 july 2018,pisces,"You may be cautious by nature, but now you’re ready to test some of your more outrageous ideas. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you to hold back. When the Sun enters Leo on Sunday, your practical side will kick in…and you’ll know exactly what to do next.

"
5838,21 july 2018,pisces,"It’s time to bust out of a romantic rut, Pisces. If you’re single and looking, you should be hunting for someone who is a break from the previous types. If you’re unhappily attached, it’s time to head for the door! And if you’re happily involved with someone, you should still be looking for ways to shake things up in the romance department.

"
5839,22 july 2018,pisces,"Snap to it! Get your sorry ass off the sofa and start getting organized. The Sun is now in Leo, your sixth house of efficiency. It’s time to pull your life together both at home and at the office. Mercury is scheduled to retrograde in this sector on Thursday, pointing out the areas that you need to address first.

"
5840,23 july 2018,pisces,"You know what you want and how to get it… or do you? Some mixed vibes coming from the cosmos could confuse you about the direction you’re heading in. It seems to be a problem of too much choice. Create a short list and go from there.

"
5841,24 july 2018,pisces,"You want to get along with other people, truly you do. But a Venus-Neptune opposition is going to make that damn difficult today! The problem is that people will not be direct, possibly resorting to passive aggressive tactics. With the Sun in the most practical part of your chart you need to demand clarity.

"
5842,25 july 2018,pisces,"You may need to be the voice of reason today, as other people seem hell bent on wallowing in chaos. The situation may be getting a little old, but if you don’t take command things could go right off the rails. The full moon on Friday is a good time to separate yourself from all of this drama.

"
5843,26 july 2018,pisces,"Your habits and routines appear to need a complete overhaul, Pisces. Intelligent Mercury goes retrograde today in your house of efficiency.

With Friday’s lunar eclipse in your house of closure, you’ll be able to completely switch over to a new way of doing things.

"
5844,27 july 2018,pisces,"It’s time to get your act together, Pisces. A no-nonsense lunar eclipse is taking place in your house of closure. From your chart, it appears that you need much better habits and systems. You also need to close out chronic health problems. If you’re willing to put in the grunt work, you can make amazing headway over the next six months.

"
5845,28 july 2018,pisces,"This is an excellent weekend for hanging out with both friends and a lover, Pisces. A happy Venus Pluto aspect is just the ticket for socializing with the people who mean the most to you. You may learn things about each other that you never knew before, deepening your bonds.

"
5846,29 july 2018,pisces,"From your chart it appears that your energy levels are down, Pisces. With intelligent Mercury in your house of wellness, you should be researching healthy diet choices and exercise regimens. It’s time to get rid of bad habits that are holding you back from living a vivacious, happy existence.

"
5847,30 july 2018,pisces,"People tend to under estimate your tolerance for taking risk. You are a far more daring person than many people realize, and today is the perfect time to act on some of your wildest dreams. The recent lunar eclipse told you to close out things in your life that are holding you back. Do that and then stepped into a brand-new tomorrow!

"
5848,31 july 2018,pisces,"You may not be in the mood for following the rules today and that’s okay. Your ruler, Neptune is inspiring you to do something a little bit different. Not off the wall; just something that takes you past your comfort zone.

"
5849,1 august 2018,pisces,"Your intuition and logical mind will be at battle today….which is why you shouldn’t make any major decisions! Unreasonable fears could also get the better of you. Wait until Saturday, when things calm down and clarity returns.

"
5850,2 august 2018,pisces,"Start freeing up more time for the more exciting things of life. You simply have to stop working so hard! You need a break, and the only way it’s going to happen is that if you make the decision to cut back on work hours.

"
5851,3 august 2018,pisces,"Watch what you say to people at the office or in a group setting. With the Sun in the most practical part of your chart, you are coming from an intelligent place. But that doesn’t mean that others want to hear your opinions. Let them figure things out for themselves.

"
5852,4 august 2018,pisces,"With unpredictable Uranus acting up in your house of communication, you could say or do just about anything! Whether that’s a good thing or not is another issue. But it’s high time that you expressed yourself. Don’t hold back.

"
5853,5 august 2018,pisces,"You need to stop getting caught up in details, and do some more of a “group think” kind of a thing. Right now some of the people around you have some pretty interesting thoughts. They’re willing to share them, and if you’re smart you will be listening. You can learn a lot from other people.

"
5854,6 august 2018,pisces,"Romantic Venus has just entered your house of sex and intimacy, setting the stage for a few steamy weeks ahead. But with so much planetary energy in the practical part of your chart, your head won’t be lost in the clouds. Singles, you’ll be looking for a team player, the kind of person who knows how to give as well as take.

"
5855,7 august 2018,pisces,"If you find that you’re pulling away from people, you can blame it on the planet Uranus. Today it goes retrograde in your house of socializing. This doesn’t mean that you’re going to become a recluse. Rather, you may decide to work independently and do your own thing.

"
5856,9 august 2018,pisces,"Come out of your shell, Pisces! Venus could be stirring up your emotions, perhaps eroding your self esteem. The best remedy for this is to socialize with people who put a smile on your face. It’s also a good time to make some new connections.

"
5857,10 august 2018,pisces,"People around you may have some big ideas, but do they have the common sense to accomplish them? Make sure that you don’t get pulled into someone else’s crazy ass scheme. Tomorrow solar eclipse occurs in your house of efficiency, turning you into a dynamo. You don’t want to get stuck doing the grunt work that is someone else’s responsibility.

"
5858,11 august 2018,pisces,"It’s time to get down to brass tacks, Pisces. With Jupiter cruising through your optimistic house of big plans and adventures, no doubt you’re ready to take on some exciting new challenges. But today’s solar eclipse falls in the most practical, detail-oriented part of your chart. It’s time to get a handle on the small stuff, as unglamorous as that may sound. Do that and you’ll be ready to take on the world.

"
5859,12 august 2018,pisces,"Friendships and team endeavors are up for revision right now. That’s because red hot Mars is retrograding through the sector that governs them. Are you surrounded by people who support you, and who make you feel appreciated and alive? Or are they weighing you down like an anchor? If it’s the latter, it’s time to make some changes.

"
5860,13 august 2018,pisces,"Misty Neptune is your ruler, which can be a good thing as well as a bad thing! It’s good when it stirs up your intuition and creativity. But it can be difficult when it makes you want to resist other people, which is what is happening today. Wait until tomorrow, a much better time for communicating and getting along with others.

"
5861,14 august 2018,pisces,"Focus on the good in others today, even if it’s tough to do! Nitpicking about others’ faults doesn’t help you and it doesn’t help them. The recent solar eclipse fell in your house of teamwork and getting things done; it will be a heck of a lot easier if you give people credit for their good side.

"
5862,15 august 2018,pisces,"This is no time to think like the rest of the crowd. The problem is, people around you may want you to do things their way. Avoid this if you can. By Friday, the Moon will be in the most freethinking part of your chart, and you’ll be able to strike out on your own.

"
5863,16 august 2018,pisces,"Your ideas and opinions may be brilliant and right on point, but that doesn’t mean that others will agree with them. As a matter of fact, someone could react quite erratically to what you have to say. Let this little storm pass. You don’t have to explain yourself to anyone.

"
5864,17 august 2018,pisces,"Getting motivated today becomes a lot easier thanks to abundant Jupiter in action! If there is something that has been on your bucket list for a long time, now’s the moment to go after it. The good news is that Mercury goes direct in the most practical part of your chart on Sunday. This will help you pursue your dreams in a realistic way.

"
5865,18 august 2018,pisces,"A healthy body is a sexy body, and it’s time to tone up yours. With romantic Venus in your house of libido, and Mercury in the house of fitness, it’s all about glowing….with good health and, uh, the kind of glow you get from a boudoir workout.

"
5866,19 august 2018,pisces,"Screw ups and dramas at the office should start to go bye-bye. Mercury has been retrograde in this part of your chart, but thank heavens it goes direct today. Even if you’re the only person on the job who has their act together, that will be good enough for you!

"
5868,21 august 2018,pisces,"Today’s cosmic energy is excellent for forging long-term connections with people: friends, a new mentor, people involved in charities or volunteer groups, or business associates. You may be used to going it alone, but over the next four weeks you are encouraged to team up with other people. Besides, you never know whom you might meet!

"
5869,22 august 2018,pisces,"You’re in a position to meet new people who have depth, Pisces. From your chart it appears that you need to be around people who bring a lot to the table, who have your back. Don’t shy away from making new connections.

"
5870,23 august 2018,pisces,"There’s a full moon arriving in your sign this Sunday, and it’s putting your needs front and center. Interesting timing considering that the Sun enters Virgo today, focusing on your most serious relationships. The trick will be about how to balance the two. Don’t make any fast decisions; wait at least two weeks before making any major decisions.

"
5871,24 august 2018,pisces,"It’s a great weekend for partying with your friends thanks to a Moon-Mars merger. It’s also an auspicious time for meeting new people, and some of them could be in your life for a long time to come. Get out of your shell and mingle.

"
5872,25 august 2018,pisces,"Getting along with other people becomes a snap thanks to two fabulous trines today. Friends, lovers, business connections, siblings, neighbors—these specific relationships are highlighted by the cosmic activity. Someone could do something spontaneous, or there could be (good) unexpected news coming your way.

"
5873,26 august 2018,pisces,"It’s always a good thing when a full moon takes place in your sign, and that’s what’s happening tonight! Things that you’ve been working on since your birthday may finally come to pass. This is a time for doing things your  way, so remember that. Others may be interested in pushing their own agenda, but don’t give them a chance.

"
5874,27 august 2018,pisces,"From your chart it appears that you need to meet new people and circulate more, and red hot Mars is in the perfect position to help you do that. No matter how independent you’ve been feeling it’s time to expand your contact list.

"
5875,28 august 2018,pisces,"Keep things on point and don’t go off on tangents. No matter how grand an idea may sound, nothing’s going to happen unless the details are taken care of. Remain practical and get the grunt work done.

"
5876,29 august 2018,pisces,"It’s important right now to be a team player, even if you don’t feel like it! The recent full moon fell in your sign, making you more motivated to pursue your own agenda. But if you come off as being too self-involved, people will get turned off. Play nice and do your own thing behind the scenes.

"
5877,30 august 2018,pisces,"It could be easy to be lulled into a false sense of security today, or even complacency. The world is changing rapidly though, and you need to change with the times. Find a balance between tradition and doing things in a futuristic way.

"
5878,31 august 2018,pisces,"Toss out your daily to-do list. Forget about your routine. A sparkling Moon-Uranus aspect tells you to do something totally spontaneous and fun. If you can get away this weekend on a quick trip, even better.

"
5879,1 september 2018,pisces,"The trolls and the naysayers could be out there, but who cares? Why should you pay any attention to people who don’t know what they’re talking about? Stick to the people who keep things real.

"
5880,2 september 2018,pisces,"Feeling comfortable in your own skin is possible, Pisces. A happy lunar aspect indicates that you should do some inner work, the kind that feeds your soul. Mindfulness meditation might work, or studying Zen Buddhism. The key is to make it a habit.

"
5881,3 september 2018,pisces,"Romantic relationships get a boost from a happy Venus-Mercury aspect that encourages more cooperation. It’s time to balance logic and passion in a union. Too much of either is not a good thing!

"
5882,4 september 2018,pisces,"Team efforts and friendships can go off the rails today. Someone may want to take the group in a different direction, but this is not a good idea. There is a time for the innovation and creativity, and a time to stick to the original plan. Right now the latter is the most important.

"
5883,5 september 2018,pisces,"You’re entering into a new phase in which communicating and cooperating with others will be of the utmost importance. Mercury has just entered your house of diplomacy. Naturally this can benefit a romantic partnership, but you could also end up being the voice of reason at work and among friends.

"
5884,6 september 2018,pisces,"Great minds think alike, and you need to surround yourself by people who know how to think differently! You also need to be surrounded by people who share your interests and know how to have fun. Fortunately for you, serious Saturn has gone direct in your house of networking. Now you can meet a fresh new crop of friends, lovers and partners in crime.

"
5885,7 september 2018,pisces,"Lively Mercury is in one helluva good mood. This little planet is determined to bring new people into your orbit, and to solidify your existing relationships as well. Be flexible today and over the weekend as things could unfold spontaneously.

"
5886,8 september 2018,pisces,"You may need more freedom than you’d care to admit, Pisces. People may be tugging at you, trying to pull you into their worlds, but right now you want to be your own person. And there’s nothing wrong with that! Be polite and diplomatic about it, but maintain boundaries too.

"
5887,10 september 2018,pisces,"You have a “one step forward, two steps back” kind of energy going on. Yesterday, vivacious Venus entered your house of adventure. But today Mars zips into your house of seclusion, rest and reflection. The smart Pisces takes chances, but only after considering all of the angles first.

"
5888,11 september 2018,pisces,"You may have had differences of opinion with people in the past. But that all changes today, thanks to some wonderful aspects that are designed to bring you together. Teamwork increases, along with optimism. You may have to be the person who spearheads this, but take charge. It will be worth it.

"
5889,13 september 2018,pisces,"What is sense and what is nonsense? Separating one from the other could be a chore. Your logical mind says one thing, and your intuitive brain says another. Don’t make any major decisions today; give things 24 hours so that you can ponder them.

"
5890,14 september 2018,pisces,"You might feel as though you’re stuck in the middle of people who can’t seem to agree. Make sure that you don’t become the dumping ground for their issues. And be careful about taking sides too. This could backfire. Be diplomatic and wait until next Tuesday, when the cosmic energy improves.

"
5891,15 september 2018,pisces,"“Plays well with others.” Remember that comment from your report card? Well, that’s the message that the cosmos has for you today: do your best to work with others. You could form some exciting new partnerships or friendships. It’s a good time to consider lending your energy to a charity or volunteer group. Going it alone isn’t advised right now!

"
5892,16 september 2018,pisces,"If life has been a little dull of late… and that includes your romance… it’s time to jazz things up! Happy go lucky Jupiter is in a good mood, encouraging you to take some chances and live a little. Life is too short to do the same old thing all the time, or to be with people who aren’t visionary.

"
5893,17 september 2018,pisces,"It’s time to cut through the myriad of choices available to you and focus on one or two things that count. This doesn’t mean that you can’t pursue other juicy opportunities. But you won’t get anything accomplished if you’re scattering your energy.

"
5894,18 september 2018,pisces,"You might want to climb a mountain and head to the nearest yogi meditation retreat today! If that’s not possible, shut off your phone and don’t look at your email. That’s because a Mars-Uranus clash could bring out the malcontents in droves today. Unless you want them pooping all over you, avoid them.

"
5895,19 september 2018,pisces,"Is it true that opposites attract? In my opinion, opposites may attract but they don’t necessarily stay together. A happy Moon-Sun aspect today helps you get on the same wavelength with others. This is true in love, in business and with your friendships.

"
5896,20 september 2018,pisces,"Diplomacy counts! Do your best to let people know that you’re willing to be a team player. This is true within your family, your friends and at the office. But this doesn’t mean that you should be walked on. Maintain your dignity and extend the olive branch at the same time

"
5897,21 september 2018,pisces,"It’s time to block out the outside world and focus on what really counts. This could mean your romantic relationship. Maybe it’s your career or your health. Mercury has entered a reflective part of your chart, and the Sun arrives tomorrow. The next four weeks are excellent for getting clear about what is important to you.

"
5898,22 september 2018,pisces,"As the Sun moves into Libra, your focus will turn into two major areas in life: your level of intimacy with a lover and your level of wealth! Yup, ancient astrologers placed these in the same sector. The next weeks are crucial for creating more cash flow, the kind you bank–serious  coin. They’re also well respected for improving your love life, especially in the bedroom.

"
5899,23 september 2018,pisces,"Why the heck are you listening to other people have to say? Why are you worried about what they think? You should be listening to the wisest person of them all: you. Your subconscious mind, that is. There is plenty of wisdom there if you’re willing to tap into it.

"
5900,24 september 2018,pisces,"You’re on the cusp of making a lot more money, Pisces. If you’re willing to hustle, that is. Tonight’s full moon occurs in your earnings sector, and it could bring something important to a profitable conclusion. You may be better off working solo right now. From your chart, it appears that team members could be difficult, egotistical or unwilling to do their share. Don’t let them slow down your momentum.

"
5901,25 september 2018,pisces,"Give an inch, take a mile? It may seem that way today. The more you let people off the hook, the more they decide to take advantage of you. Either stand your ground, or avoid those people who seem to be working on their own personal agenda.

"
5902,26 september 2018,pisces,"You may need to change course today. Or perhaps you have to change some habits or a routine. Take care of this right away and don’t delay. Some wonderful new things are about to open up, and you need to be at the right place at the right time.

"
5903,27 september 2018,pisces,"You are in an open frame of mind today, able to listen to other peoples’ opinions and honor them. It’s important that you express your feelings and opinions too. Things that you thought were problems may start to disappear, thanks to your compassion and consideration.

"
5904,28 september 2018,pisces,"There’s nothing wrong with lofty ideas. But if you want them to take flight, you have to do the requisite planning. From your chart, it appears that your head is in the clouds…and you’re not thinking about what it’s going to take to get things done. Start planning now.

"
5905,29 september 2018,pisces,"It’s time to pay attention to your nearest and dearest, Pisces. Your life can’t be about work all the time, or getting errands done. The people who are closest to you need you, and you need them. Don’t forget that.

"
5906,30 september 2018,pisces,"Anyone who thinks that you’re a sensitive type needs to pay attention, Pisces. Yes, you have feelings just like the rest of us. But you’re also shrewd and logical, something that they may realize today.

"
5907,1 october 2018,pisces,"Trying to fit in with the crowd will backfire today, so don’t even try. You are your own person with your own ideas and dreams. Gaining permission from others to live authentically is not necessary. Wednesday is the perfect time to let your freak flag fly!

"
5908,2 october 2018,pisces,"You know what they say: it takes teamwork to make the dream work. Problem is, teamwork will be in short supply today. Egotistical people may try to take over, or refuse to do their share. Wait until Monday’s new Moon to try to get the situation back on track.

"
5909,3 october 2018,pisces,"You should be feeling daring, optimistic and ready for change…..and there’s nothing wrong with that! So go ahead, take a chance. Put yourself out there. Adventure is calling your name.

"
5910,4 october 2018,pisces,"Make sure that you can deliver what you promise, Pisces. A Moon-Uranus square could prompt you to say things that could be hard to honor later on. Remaining practical and conservative is the smartest thing you can do today.

"
5911,5 october 2018,pisces,"Audacious plans may need to be revised over the next three weeks. Venus has just started spinning backward in your house of travel, education, entrepreneurship and anything that’s big and bold. But this won’t last long; it will be over by the 31st. In the meantime, do your homework on these projects.

"
5912,6 october 2018,pisces,"It won’t be easy to figure out what motives people have this weekend. There will be a lot of opinionated people in your life over the next week, which could make things more complicated. So take your time and don’t make any big decisions.

"
5913,7 october 2018,pisces,"It’s time for an emotional cleansing, Pisces. Tomorrow’s new Moon occurs in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. We all have past traumas and emotions that are holding us back. Dump yours and get ready to move on.

"
5914,8 october 2018,pisces,"There is a new Moon in your house of deep emotion, so why is it so hard to get the words out? It’s because the two most obstinate planets in the solar system, Mars and Uranus, are in wonky positions. That’s okay. You have six months to express yourself. This is an excellent time to do some much needed inner work.

"
5915,9 october 2018,pisces,"Taking intelligent chances is the name of the game now that Mercury is in Scorpio. Over the next three weeks, you can consider new ways of doing things. Don’t dive in to quickly, though. Consider your options, and then get ready to launch on the 23rd.

"
5916,11 october 2018,pisces,"Now that Mercury is in your house of breaking the rules, it’s time to do just that! But this isn’t about being a lone rebel. You should be teaming up with others who know how to think differently, who want to shake things up in a good way.

"
5917,12 october 2018,pisces,"The more the merrier! The cosmos is telling you to get out of the house or the office and boogie down. Actually, next week is looking pretty social too, so get the party started now….and keep it going.

"
5918,13 october 2018,pisces,"You may not feel like doing much this weekend, and that’s OK. You need a break. And the Moon enters into your house of friends and partying, all the more reason to have a good time!

"
5919,14 october 2018,pisces,"If you need to ask a trusted friend for help or advice, now’s the time to do so. People are going to show their true colors this week. Find the ones you can count on.

"
5920,15 october 2018,pisces,"Honey, you are so ready for adventure. A glistening Mercury-Venus conjunction is pushing you to try some new things (which includes people!). Planets in your networking sector are telling you to find partners in crime (in a manner of speaking). It’s time to do a “Thelma and Louise”.

"
5921,16 october 2018,pisces,"You’re known by the company you keep, and the cosmos is telling you to make some changes. This doesn’t mean that you should dump the tribe. But you should consider joining up with new people, the kind that are excited about life and want to savor every moment of it.

"
5922,17 october 2018,pisces,"You’re in a highly intuitive state these days, so use that to your advantage! But even psychics have blind spots. So don’t assume that you’re going to have a 100% success rate. Use some logic too.

"
5923,18 october 2018,pisces,"Your mind could stir up all kinds of dramas today, many of which aren’t based on reality. This is especially true if you’re on the verge of making a big change. Quit worrying and take the plunge!

"
5924,19 october 2018,pisces,"Anyone who thinks that a Pisces isn’t bold and daring ought to take a look at you now! A Neptune-Mercury aspect is bringing out your flamboyant, risk-taking side. There could be dream stealers or trolls in your midst, though. Are you going to pay any attention to them? Hell, no!

"

Some people think they’re a waste of time, while others believe that it’s helpful to have a clear picture about where you’re going.

They’re on a mission to see that you live a truly authentic life. And when Mercury enters your house of goals on Wednesday, it’s all systems go.

"
5935,30 october 2018,pisces,"You could find yourself in the middle of someone else’s drama. The question is: do you really want to be involved? You may mean well, but this situation may not be worth it. Besides, your values may be quite different than those of the other person. Be of assistance but not too much!

"
5936,31 october 2018,pisces,"It seems that you have a lot of thinking to do when it comes to your future path. Mercury enters your house of success and dream achievement today, but at the same time Venus retrogrades, making you question what to do next. Wait until November 15th before committing to anything or anyone.

"

"
5938,2 november 2018,pisces,"You won’t be in the mood today for taking advice from other people. After all, do they really know what’s best for you? A potent Sun-Neptune aspect on Tuesday is better for soliciting advice from people who really know what’s going on.

"
5939,3 november 2018,pisces,"Be true to yourself, Pisces. If you do that then life will fall into place. But if you try to mold yourself into someone that you’re not, especially to please others, you’ll never find contentment.

"
5940,4 november 2018,pisces,"Plans and dreams that have been stuck start to develop momentum this week. This is in part due to your passion.  If you believe in something enough, and apply your passion to it, you will be an unstoppable force.

"
5955,20 november 2018,pisces,"Big conservative with money today. Don’t spend cash that you don’t have, running up credit card debt. Unpredictable Uranus is active in your money sector, and it’s important to remain conservative as a result.

"
5956,21 november 2018,pisces,"Believe it or not, you serve as a role model to other people. Your talent and calm demeanor serve as an example to others who like to emulate you. Don’t be surprised if others ask if they can learn your tricks!

"
5957,22 november 2018,pisces,"The cosmos is serving up some mixed messages today, Pisces.

"
5964,30 november 2018,pisces,"Don’t be so emo! The cosmos is telling you to think with both your head and your heart. If you rely purely on emotions, you’ll end up going all over the place. Chill out already.

"
5965,2 december 2018,pisces,"Life is too short to keep doing things the same old way, Pisces! Now that charismatic Venus is in the most adventurous part of your chart,it’s time to show the world that you’re an original. So have fun letting your freak flag fly.

"
5966,3 december 2018,pisces,"This could be a confusing week, one in which you can’t figure out which direction to head in. That’s because aggressive Mars and murky Neptune are traveling close together in your sign. Don’t make any major decisions until after this weekend’s new moon.

"
5967,5 december 2018,pisces,"People could be getting all over your case with demands and criticism. The question is: do they know what they’re talking about? Be honest with yourself. If their remarks have merit, maybe you need to make some changes.

"
5968,6 december 2018,pisces,"Options are starting to become available to you, and if you’re smart, you’ll take them! The planets are lining up to introduce you to new people and circumstances. Keep an open mind.

"
5969,7 december 2018,pisces,"A game changing new moon occurs in your house of goals and ambition. The reason it’s so highly charged is that Mars and Neptune are both in your sign, making you reexamine your assumptions. Old ideas and plans could get tossed as you do a 180 and choose brand new ones.

5970,8 december 2018,pisces,"A little voice is telling you that there’s more to life than what you currently are experiencing. Pay attention to it, because it could take you somewhere.

"
5971,9 december 2018,pisces,"Chiron, the wounded healer, is active in your sign today. It’s telling you just forget about what society wants. Or what your family wants. Or what your friends want. It’s all about you, living an authentic life.

"
5972,10 december 2018,pisces,"Today’s a good day to speak up, the matter how “out there” your ideas may be. People need to hear the truth and they also need to be exposed to more visionary concepts. You are just the person to point these out to them.

"
5973,11 december 2018,pisces,"Big dreams often cost money. If you’re trying to figure out how to finance one, then the cosmos has your back. Tomorrow shrewd little Mercury enters your house of success, helping you to put the pieces together.

"
5974,12 december 2018,pisces,"Is the sky the limit? It sure looks that way from your chart. With the two most generous planets and the solar system, Jupiter and Venus, in your house of optimism you should be flying high. It’s time to align yourself with people who feel the same way as you. Trolls and whiners have no place in your life!

"
5975,13 december 2018,pisces,"There could be some power plays at home or at work, but you have what it takes to deal with them. Stay diplomatic and keep things logical instead of emotional.

"
5976,14 december 2018,pisces,"I pity the person who gets in your way today. With aggressive Mars barreling through your sign, you won’t be in the mood for dealing with fools. Tell them to get out of your way before you run them over.

Between now and late January you could meet some real winners, people who will change your life for the better.

"
5979,18 december 2018,pisces,"The Sun will only be spending a few more days in your house of ambition, so think now about what you’d like to manifest in 2019. A brilliant Uranus aspect today is especially favorable for coming up with money making ideas.

"
5980,19 december 2018,pisces,"From your chart it appears that you have to start enjoying life more, Pisces! So wrap up all of the holiday nonsense and your work at the office. Once the weekend rolls around, it’s time to treat yourself to nights out on the town, some swag and a little lovin’, too.

"
5981,20 december 2018,pisces,"The year may be winding down, but you’re not. If anything you’re gaining momentum. Surprise-a-minute Uranus is active, driving you to tackle whatever is in front of you. But once Saturday’s full moon arrives, it’s party time.

"
5982,21 december 2018,pisces,"Yeah, baby!! The Sun enters your house of partying with friends today. Then the full moon tomorrow occurs in your house of romance. Is this going to be a highly social holiday season? Uh-huh. Hope you’re well rested.

"
5983,22 december 2018,pisces,"Where is that mistletoe? Find it, stat! There’s a full moon coming in your house of romance. And since full moons tend to bring things to a close, just about anything happen: an engagement, finding The One, conceiving a baby, or creating a deeper bond with your lover. Gotta love it.

"
5984,23 december 2018,pisces,"What are you waiting for? Some kind of message from the heavens telling you that it’s okay to be who you want to be? The perfect moment? Please. The perfect moment is right here, right now. Get going.

"
5985,24 december 2018,pisces,"Don’t let anyone push you into a corner and do anything that doesn’t feel right. While you may not want to confront anyone today, you can certainly speak up on Thursday, when assertive Mars has your back.

"
5986,25 december 2018,pisces,"Christmas is in the air, and the moon is in Leo! Leo is your house of cooperation and teamwork, so hopefully your loved ones will get the message that you’re not the family’s maid. Besides, from your chart it looks like you all need to have a lot more fun. Schedule some quality time on Thursday and Friday.

"
5987,26 december 2018,pisces,"A sudden urge to purge may hit you today. So, grab a garbage bag (or two–or ten) and start tossing things out. Don ye old rubber gloves and start cleaning. This is a good time to let 2018 go, literally and figuratively.

"
5988,27 december 2018,pisces,"Don’t be afraid to take a few risks. With ambitious Mars in your sign, chances are that you’re thinking about doing things differently. And with the Moon in the most creative part of your chart, you can dream up some pretty interesting scenarios.

"
5989,28 december 2018,pisces,"Some excellent planetary aspects today and into next week are suitable for doing some much needed inner work. You don’t need to stay stuck in the same old self image, or the same boring set of circumstances. But in order for change to happen, first you have to change your way of thinking.

"
5990,29 december 2018,pisces,"Red hot Mars will be in your sign for only a few more days. This means that you need to push yourself hard, maybe harder than you’re used to. You’ve only tapped into 50% of what you’re capable of.

"
5991,30 december 2018,pisces,"Chances are you’re craving more stability in life, Pisces. A Moon-Uranus aspect today will make that abundantly clear. No problem! Once Mars enters your house of security and ritual tomorrow, you’ll have weeks to develop a strong foundation.

"
5992,31 december 2018,pisces,"2018 is finally coming to an end, and the past few weeks could have been transformational. That’s because red hot Mars was transiting your sign, making you consider your self-image and plans. It moves on today to your house of money: making more and saving it. You do  have to watch out for overspending when Mars is here. That said, you can make a lot of progress when it comes to pulling in more dinero.

"
5993,1 january 2017,aries,"2017 begins with your subconscious mind in a highly active state, thanks to motivator Mars and intuitive Neptune in fine form. Today’s a day to dream–about what you’d like to manifest in the brand new year ahead. Don’t dismiss thoughts as fantasies or impossible either; with rational Saturn in your house of the big picture, your daydreams may be more achievable than you realize.

"
5994,2 january 2017,aries,"Relationships can start to pick up steam now that Uranus has resumed direct motion. But in order for you to really connect with someone else you need to figure out your own emotions first. Is it time to be an open book and let the other person know exactly what’s on you mind? Or is is wiser to hold back and keep some things to yourself? With the passionate Moon entering your house of secretiveness today, you may opt for discretion.

"
5995,3 january 2017,aries,"Who can you trust? Over the next four weeks the cosmos will be asking you that question, courtesy of hosting Venus in your vibey, intuitive twelfth house. This can be an auspicious time for “cleaning house”, in a manner of speaking. Even if everyone in your world is true blue you still have the opportunity to do some inner work. Ridding yourself of negative thoughts and becoming more mindful is a great way to start the new year.

"
5996,4 january 2017,aries,"Thinking about taking some classes in 2017? Expanding your mind via travel and study? If that’s the case, now’s the time to plan. Mercury retrogrades into your ninth house of broadening your horizons. Attend a lecture or personal growth workshop, learn a new skill, take a chance by becoming an entrepreneur or pen the novel that’s been rattling around in your brain for so long. Carpe diem, baby!

"
5997,5 january 2017,aries,"As erratic Uranus grows ever closer to opposing benevolent Jupiter in the sky, you may feel as though your needs and plans are in direct conflict with someone close, such as your lover or a business partner. This feeling could be amplified today as the emotional Moon is actively stirring the pot. But count to ten and breathe. You’re about to step into quite a powerful situation on Saturday, which could be career related or simply a strong sense that everything is going to start going your way.

"
5998,6 january 2017,aries,"You’ve never been one to hold back, Aries, being known as one of the risk takers of the zodiac. The other sign that’s famous for adventure is Sagittarius. Well, with the Moon in your sign sending smoke signals to Mercury in Sag, it’s time to plan an escapade or two. Listen, Mercury is  retrograde, so today’s a good day just for thinking about your plans. When it resumes direct motion on Sunday, swing into action.

"
5999,7 january 2017,aries,"Haven’t gotten your 2017 resolutions off the ground yet? No problem! A super-charged meeting today between the Sun and Pluto sets the stage for a major strategy session. These are the two most authoritative orbs in the solar system, and they meet in your tenth house of achievement, goals and success. The decision that you make today can be life changing. And with Mercury going direct tomorrow in your house of optimism and busting past limits, it’s nothing but blue skies ahead. Go for it.

"
6000,8 january 2017,aries,"Confusion and concern start to dissipate as Mercury finally goes direct. In your case Aries, financial conundrums should straighten out, such as a medical bill that’s been in dispute, or waiting for a court award check to show up at your lawyer’s office. Matters that deal with commission checks, royalties, child support, inheritances and joint business ventures will smooth over, which will bring a sigh of relief. Been hit with unexpected expenses? That should start to abate too. When Mercury enters Capricorn on Thursday a far more relaxed vibe sweeps in.

"
6001,9 january 2017,aries,"Just the facts, ma’am! That’s your motto o’ the day, Aries, as a tense Moon-Neptune square could completely screw up your ability to intuit what’s going on around you. Keep it real as your emotions could be all over the place, making you the perfect victim for someone else’s not-so-pleasant agenda. Don’t fall for flattery, guilt trips, head games or anything else that has a whiff of BS clinging to it.

"
6002,10 january 2017,aries,"Take a deep breath and count to ten. Someone may be on the warpath today, and with erratic Uranus acting up in your sign, you might overreact. Seems like the other person is trying to gain control of a situation—or even you—and your temper could rise. Let this tempest in a teapot pass by and wait for calmer waters.

"
6003,11 january 2017,aries,"Great day for behind the scenes planning and activity. With energetic Mars in the most confidential part of your chart forming a terrific aspect to Pluto, this is a good time to examine the weak spots in your life (we all have them!). Maybe it’s your finances, or bad eating habits that negatively affect your vitality and physique. Perhaps you’re carrying too much stress and resentment in your waking moments. Stuck in a job you don’t like? This is one of the best times all year to start snooping alternative choices. Carpe diem.

"
6004,12 january 2017,aries,"Domestic bliss? The full moon in Cancer shines its light on housing matters, family issues, your relationship and overall state of contentment. You’re definitely interested in seeing that your life is more serene, but do other people around you share the same idea? A difficult Grand Cross in the heavens could make peace look like a pipe dream right now. Fortunately, chatty Mercury enters your authoritative tenth house today. You may need to put people on notice that you’re not going to deal with drama on a regular basis.

"
6005,14 january 2017,aries,"Sometimes living a more romantic and creative lifestyle is just a matter of an attitude adjustment. Sure, we’d all love a windfall of cash, but the cosmos suggests that a more authentic lifestyle can come just as easily from taking a different viewpoint. How can you get in touch with your inner writer, poet, lover, painter, grande dame or heart throb today?

"
6006,15 january 2017,aries,"Stick to the tried and true today and during the first half of the week: familiar habits, routines and circumstances. This doesn’t mean that you have to put up with them forever if you’re not thrilled with them, but right now is not the best time to change. Quietly figure out what you’d like to switch up, then hit the ground running when Mars enters Aries on the 28th.

"
6007,16 january 2017,aries,"Developing a balance between getting your tasks done and resting up could be a bit tricky these days! But it’s necessary as your life is about to get a lot busier. Try to wrap up some of your bigger plans now, before the Sun enters Aquarius on Thursday. Then you’ll have more down time to chill and have fun with friends.

"
6008,17 january 2017,aries,"It’s essential to know what’s going on in a business situation, as planets in the most ambitious part of your chart are active. Some interesting opportunities could come your way over the next two weeks, and the better informed you are, the easier it will be to make a smart decision.

"
6009,18 january 2017,aries,"“Plays well with others.” Remember that from back in the day on your report card? Well, that’s the way to describe Aries folks over the next four weeks. What’s going to count more than anything, ram, is that you make the effort to cooperate with the people in your orbit, in both your personal life and in business. Don’t worry, your intuition is in fine form, helping guide you along the way. The key is to play nice, even if you’re pushing forward your own agenda—which you will!

"
6010,19 january 2017,aries,"The Sun moves into Aquarius, your eleventh house of pursuing big dreams and large scale projects. But a tense Mars-Saturn aspect warns against taking on too many things at one time. It seems that some inner work needs to be done, too, before you leap headlong into the future. Maintaining serenity is just as important as getting things crossed off your to-do list.

"
6011,20 january 2017,aries,"How deep is your contact list? Over the next four weeks you should aim to make it deeper, now that the Sun is in Aquarius, your house of networking. Making new connections is the way to grow your business, find a new gig and get introduced to a new flame. Aquarius is also your house of technology, so now’s the time to develop a website, app, social media campaign or a post that will go viral.

"
6012,21 january 2017,aries,"Demand more. You heard me. Especially when it comes to love! The moon is in sexy, intimate Scorpio for the weekend, the perfect place for getting closer to your amour or a new soulmate. La Luna sends a sparkling vibe to Chiron, the wounded healer, telling you that you don’t have to settle in matters of the heart. Nope, that’s not your karma.

"
6013,22 january 2017,aries,"The cosmos suggests that you focus on “inner work”, getting in touch with the more spiritual side of your nature. You’re definitely the go-go-go type of individual, but even a hard-charging ram needs to slow down once in awhile to gain perspective. Seeking the wisdom of philosophies that you haven’t been exposed to before could help open your mind to a different way of thinking–and therefore, living.

"
6014,23 january 2017,aries,"Passion and commitment! It helps to have both, and with the Moon conjuncting Saturn today, you will. Sign up for a class, go for a degree, learn a new skill or language, start a business, or even fall in love with someone who’s not the usual type. These two orbs meet up in your multiculti ninth house of adventure and personal exploration. Bon voyage.

"
6015,24 january 2017,aries,"Get ready to rumble. With a glorious new moon on Friday in your house of networking, and assertive Mars moving into your sign on Saturday, you should already start feeling the desire to get yourself out there and mingle. In the weeks ahead it’s the people you know that can help you more than what  you know.

"
6093,15 april 2017,aries,"The last month may have been a bit moody and confusing as the planet of self-image, Venus, has been retrograde in your house of reflection and dumping mental baggage. Good news–it switches to direct motion today, helping you get more clear about how to build your esteem. When the Sun enters Taurus next week you’ll feel even stronger.

"
6094,16 april 2017,aries,"A subtle Venus-Mars aspect helps bring sexy back. Stop putting yourself down and comparing yourself to other people. Likewise, don’t let their remarks or opinions discourage you from feeling vibrant and alive. You don’t have to make an announcement to the world that you’re changing; this aspect actually encourages a secretive approach.

"
6095,17 april 2017,aries,"A happy Sun-Saturn aspect boots your confidence and provides you with the motivation to take action on a big plan or idea that’s been rolling around in your head. You may surprise people with your originality and the strength of your convictions, but don’t let that stop you. When you’re on to something you know it!

"
6096,18 april 2017,aries,"If your gut is telling you to get moving with a particular plan of action you should be listening. Start taking action but don’t move too  quickly. Pluto is about to retrograde in your ambition sector, a benefit actually as it will point out the hidden and potential roadblocks to your progress–which includes other people.

"
6097,19 april 2017,aries,"Now that the Sun is in the income sector of your chart you can make headway when it comes to pulling in more dinero. But you won’t get far if you push up against people in positions of authority. Aim for diplomacy (not brown nosing). Also, double check all of your facts and strategies as Mercury retrogrades in Aries on Thursday. If possible, hold off on making big moves until May 3rd when it resumes direct motion.

"
6098,20 april 2017,aries,"Stop the presses! Hit the pause button on your plans, Aries, as Mercury retrogrades in your sign through May 3rd. You’ll need to review everything as Pluto retrogrades also in your ambition sector. But this doesn’t mean that you need to scrap closely cherished ideas and projects. Just go slowly and make sure that you’ve thought things through. Since Pluto govern authority figures, they may be slower than usual to open doors between now and late September.

"
6099,21 april 2017,aries,"Your sign is known for its assertiveness, and now that Mars is in your chatty third house you’ll become even more vocal. The next few weeks are super for socializing and making a good impression, whether you want to meet the neighbors, find a new honey or connect with decision makers who can advance your career. Just watch the tendency to be pushy or way too focused on your own agenda. You can make a lot of headway but other people will be a big part of your success and happiness.

"
6100,22 april 2017,aries,"Get real about romance as love planet Venus is in a tough angle to serious Saturn. Placing someone on a pedestal? Assuming that this is “The One”—after only two dates? Ignoring the problems in an existing relationship? The good news is that Saturn is working hard to create a happy long term bond for you. But you need to maintain a logical viewpoint in order to get there.

"
6101,23 april 2017,aries,"Yum! Today is a sweet time for romance, the kind where you spend quiet time alone. The passionate Moon meets up with romantic Venus in the most secluded part of your chart. Singles, you could meet someone new in a way that’s not the usual (like the bar scene or online dating). Chances are this person will be a soulful type, not flashy or dramatic, but who needs more drama, anyway?

"
6102,24 april 2017,aries,"Got a genius idea in that brain of yours? Then run with it! A smokin’ hot Mercury-Saturn aspect urges you to buckle down and take it from the idea stage to reality. This could be a plan for a new garden bed, a screenplay, a winery tour of the Napa Valley, coding an app or applying to graduate school. There are no limits to what you can pursue, so get moving.

It occurs in your second house, which governs not only the money you earn but the good habits you need to develop in order to make things happen. With disciplinarian Saturn in your house of thinking outside the box, it would be smart to consider different ways of earning a living than the same old-same old. Hmmm…is there an entrepreneurial venture in your future?

"
6105,27 april 2017,aries,"Yesterday’s new moon in your income sector has opened up a six month period of wonderful opportunity. However, you’re not going to be able to do this all on your own—people in positions of authority will be influential in your success. Today a superb Moon-Pluto aspect allows you to make the big ask or the hot presentation. Since Pluto is retrograde, key decision makers may be slower than usual to respond, but that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t showcase your talents.

"
6106,28 april 2017,aries,"Second time is a charm? Luxe Venus enters Aries for the second time this year, blessing your sign with another opportunity to get things right! This is especially true of romance, since Venus is the planet of love. But you can also make headway with personal projects, such as a diet, makeover or pursuing a big dream: going back to university, starting a business, traveling around the world or writing a book. Innovative Uranus is active, putting outrageous new ideas in your head. But what’s wrong with that?

"
6107,29 april 2017,aries,"If you don’t have anything nice to say about someone, don’t say it. Remember that old warning from Mom? It holds true with a stern Moon-Saturn opposition. As a matter of fact, you may want to keep all of your opinions to yourself today, whether they’re about politics, the state of the economy or just about any topic, no matter how innocuous it may seem.  People take offense easily under current planetary aspects.

"
6108,30 april 2017,aries,"Take some time out today to do a little “family planning”. No, this doesn’t mean birth control or timing the arrival of your next baby! This is a financial activity in which you ensure that there’s going to be enough money in the future for buying real estate, paying for college, covering medical bills, helping out an elderly parent and the like. Singles should be paying close attention to their retirement and investment portfolios. Do it now and thank yourself later.

"
6109,1 may 2017,aries,"Don’t cage me in! That may be your battle cry as the Moon squares Uranus. If people close to you start laying on the demands, chances are you’re going to give them a piece of your mind. But they ain’t seen nothing yet. Wait until Wednesday when Mercury goes direct in Aries. Then you’ll be locked and loaded.

"
6110,2 may 2017,aries,"Energetic Mars is tearing through your house of thinking, causing all sorts of bright ideas to bubble to the surface.

Considering that intelligent Mercury resumes direct motion tomorrow in your sign, it’s all systems go.

"
6111,3 may 2017,aries,"Yaasss! Mercury goes direct in Aries, unsnarling the stinky little snafus that may have been stalling your life and making things more difficult than they needed to be. Now’s the time to just focus on your  needs for awhile. Solo endeavors can take off, and with the Sun in your second house of creating routines and stability, you can dive right in and do things right.

"
6112,4 may 2017,aries,"You may need to adjust your expectations of others, Aries. While you’d love to assume that everyone in your circle is on the same page as you (and just as motivated), the planets indicate otherwise. This doesn’t mean that you should let anyone slide or take advantage of you; it simply means that you need to keep an eye on folks and prod them gently. Tomorrow is a better day to lay down the law.

"
6113,5 may 2017,aries,"Your dignity is rising, thanks to the mighty Sun in the part of your chart that allows you to see yourself in a brand new light. And this means that you don’t have to be someone’s doormat, enabler, or go-to gal or guy. Politely but firmly let others know that there’s a new Aries in town, one who values their time and peace of mind.

"
6114,6 may 2017,aries,"Reality check! Moon-Saturn square tells you to snap out of wishful thinking, wherever it may be taking you: your finances, weight, love life, career, you name it. But you’re fortunate, Aries, in that logical Saturn is currently transiting the most daring part of your chart. You can  make things happen, but that’s the key. They’re not going to arrive magically on your door step. Daily action is required.

"
6115,7 may 2017,aries,"Passion is a fabulous thing when focused in the right direction, and today you can do just that. A vibey Moon-Jupiter connection allows you to zero in on the people and things that would make you the most happy. But it may be time to reframe what’s important to you, as inspirational Neptune tells you to take a second look.

"
6116,8 may 2017,aries,"A strong independent streak is building inside, Aries, making you question just how badly you want to remain within a certain union or group. It could be a romance, volunteer organization, job or with acquaintances. Whatever the connection may be, your emotions could be running high—along with your mouth. But that’s fine! Sometimes people need to hear the truth about what you think and feel.

"
6117,9 may 2017,aries,"Someone influential may be able to pull some strings for you thanks to power broker Pluto in a good spot today. It’s also an auspicious time to make presentations to big prospects or potential employers. And with the Sun in your house of earnings, the initiatives that you get started within the next few days could pay off quite nicely.

"
6118,10 may 2017,aries,"Are you in or are you out? The full moon asks you just how comfortable you are in a romantic union. Unhappy? Then you might decide to bolt, especially if you’ve been feeling hemmed in, unable to be your true self within the relationship. A spunky Mercury-Uranus aspect will fire up your desire to go. But if you’re happy in love, then this lunation could spur rapid advancement to a higher level: an engagement, moving in together or having a baby. Singles. a soulmate is on the horizon. Just don’t jump in too quickly.

"
6119,11 may 2017,aries,"You’re in an excellent spot to boost your financial bottom line thanks to yesterday’s full moon in the house of wealth.

It’s also stellar for singles to find a keeper. But don’t push too hard too fast, a possibility with aggressive Mars in your communication sector. Strong (and profitable) business alliances can be formed too, so consider who might be a worthwhile partner or mentor.

"
6121,13 may 2017,aries,"You may need to revise your finances, Aries. Current planetary aspects recommend examining your budget for leaks or waste. Self-employed? Then take a look at your revenue streams. Perhaps you need to toss one and replace it with another that has more potential. This exercise is especially important when it comes to the bigger expenses, such as college for the kids, your retirement or buying a place. Serious Saturn demands that if you want to fund the larger projects that you start saving now.

"
6122,14 may 2017,aries,"Nothing’s going to stop you from saying what’s on your mind, Aries. Your intuition has been operating at full throttle with vibey Neptune in a good angle, and with assertive Mars in your chatty third house you’ll be ready to share your ideas. But this isn’t a negative thing: today’s aspects put you in the perfect spot to express yourself passionately, without drama and to the people closest to you.

"
6123,15 may 2017,aries,"OK, put on your ripped sweatshirts, get into Flashdance  mode and sing along with me: “Take your passion, and make it happen….bein’s believin’, I can have it all, I’m dancing for my life”. Too young to remember that movie? Then you need to watch it, because its message is the same message that the cosmos has for your sign today: find what you’re passionate about and make it your career. Can’t afford to do that? Then figure out a way to do it on the side, to weave it into your daily existence.

"
6124,16 may 2017,aries,"Time to feng shui your life? Your desire to simplify your habits, home and work flow should increase now that Mercury is in Taurus.

There’s no need to beat them over the head with your opinions; as a matter of fact, once the Sun enters Gemini on Saturday people all around you, in your personal and business lives, will become a lot more interested in what you have to say.

"
6126,18 may 2017,aries,"Hosting Venus in your sign is terrific for feeling better about yourself, whether it’s on a physical level or a mental one. Making over your hair, wardrobe, physique and attitude are all highly favored right now. Just remember that self-esteem comes from within though. Don’t hold your dignity and self respect hostage to the opinions of others. If you’re doing inner and outer “work” on yourself, make sure that you’re doing it primarily for you.

"
6127,19 may 2017,aries,"Rebel, rebel! A rare aspect occurs as maverick Uranus, the cosmos’s rule breaker, aligns with Saturn, the strict task master. This is actually a good thing, considering that the ringed planet is in your sector of visionary thinking. This means that you can make sweeping changes without doing anything too foolish. Start with yourself, as Uranus is in Aries. Sometimes if we adjust our attitude the rest of the world catches on that we’ve changed somehow, and they end up treating us better as a result.

"
6128,20 may 2017,aries,"Can we talk? The Sun enters the chattiest part of your chart today, setting up a four-week period in which you can schmooze, flirt, strategize and clink cocktail glasses with your pals. Just be mindful as to what you say and the people with whom you share important information as there are some dicey days ahead, such as the 25th (new moon!) and the 29th. Otherwise you’re in a super place to enjoy strategic work sessions with like-minded people, socialize and express yourself brilliantly through any media: blogging, art, music, writing or videos.

"
6129,21 may 2017,aries,"Lovely lunar aspect helps you open up the lines of communication with loved ones, which doesn’t just mean serious convos. How about calling your friends and scheduling an impromptu brunch, massage or day at the museum? If no one’s available it’s still the perfect day for getting outside and going window shopping or taking a restorative walk in nature.

"
6130,22 may 2017,aries,"Your self esteem gets a big boost as magnetic Venus meets up with the Moon in your sign, Aries! You deserve to feel happy about yourself, and it’s a good time to start showing off the goods, so to speak. Socializing and a little shameless self-promotion are in order but make sure that you don’t go overboard. Not everyone will share your viewpoint or enthusiasm, which is fine–you don’t need their approval.

"
6131,23 may 2017,aries,"In order to earn more you may need to learn more first. Planning an exciting vacation? Do as much homework as you can. The same goes for researching colleges, a new neighborhood to live in, or the insiders’ techniques to starting a blog or business venture. Glossing over details is not a smart move these days, and with go-go-go Mars in your house of thinking, it’s an easy mistake to make. Slow down and allow yourself time to do things the right way.

"
6132,24 may 2017,aries,"Want to see more green in your wallet, more responsibility or kudos for a job well done? Then step up to the plate and get ready to hit the ball out of the park. A lunar aspect is auspicious for impressing higher ups. If you feel as though someone in a position of authority is holding you back, it’s not wise to confront them, nor to kiss up. Find a way around them instead.

"
6133,26 may 2017,aries,"If criticism comes your way from someone, just let it pass. What people often say or do is more about them than it is about you. Fortunately, from your chart it appears that you will bounce back from this quickly, with the attitude of “life is too short to worry about this.” Amen.

"
6134,27 may 2016,aries,"The squeaky wheel gets greased? The recent new moon in your talkative third house tells you to make your voice heard. But this can often be done in subtler ways than speech. The way you write, the manner in which you strategize and your body language are all ways to reach out to the world with your message. Developing a brand or a promotional effort? Then put a lot of effort into graphics, copy writing, smart social media tactics. Take your time with this as stern Saturn warns against rushing.

"
6135,28 may 2017,aries,"Searching for inspiration? Then look no further than your own mind. Influential Neptune is in a good spot, and if you take the time to listen to your inner wisdom, you can’t go wrong. Intelligent Mercury helps you take things from the idea stage to reality.

"
6136,29 may 2017,aries,"What you may perceive as witty banter or stimulating conversation may be viewed by others as opinionated bloviating. Watch what you say today, Aries, as megamouth Mars is off and running in your house of conversation and thinking. It opposes Saturn, and the ringed planet will not  be amused by idle chatter, ranting or oversharing. Take a vow of silence for the day.

"
6137,30 may 2017,aries,"It’s a great day for a fresh start, especially if you’re interested in changing the way you present yourself to the world. This just isn’t the obvious stuff, like hair and makeup and clothing. How about the way you speak, or write? Are you perceived as being an innovative thinker or just another cog in the wheel? Innovative Uranus is firing you up to turn your self-image or personal brand into something sensational.

That’s because vivacious Venus in your sign is spurring you to get off your duff and start taking some intelligent, calculated risks. You may not be able to control what other people are going to do or say, but you certainly have power over your own decisions and activities.

"
6140,1 june 2016,aries,"There’s an old saying: if you can’t win them with words, baffle them with bulls***. And you, Aries, have to have your BS meter up and running today, as you could be at the receiving end of it. A tough square between the Sun and Neptune could create a situation in which you are being forthright and open, yet others around you are not. So you can lay all your cards on the table and show your hand, but the other party may have a trick up their sleeve. Stay on your toes.

"
6141,2 june 2017,aries,"Your ideas have a lot of power these days as the mighty Sun is stoking the most intellectual part of your chart. Whether you want to win over a potential lover, employer or committee, a sparkling Sun-Jupiter aspect will put the right words in your mind—and then into your mouth or on paper. Partnering with others can be the best way to go these days, considering that lucky Jupiter is in your house of collaborations. And yes, that does include love!

"
6142,2 june 2016,aries,"Finally! All the hard work you’ve been doing may start to pay off, thanks to a positive angle between the Moon and the North Node. There is a highly karmic vibe to this, as if the cosmos is getting ready to reward you. But it’s wise to keep on plugging away quietly without calling attention to yourself. Neptune in the most secretive part of your chart is in a good angle, providing you with an extra dollop of inspiration from the shadows.

"
6143,3 june 2017,aries,"Whoa!!! What just happened? That’s what you may be thinking today as erratic Uranus stirs things up. You may decide that you’ve had enough of someone’s shenanigans and tell them to hit the road. Likewise, you could blurt out your hidden admiration (lust, love, whatever) to another. Your emotions could be going all over the map and God only knows what Aries is going to do next. But this could also bring about a life-affirming “Eureka!” moment in which you realize that it’s time to push yourself past previous limiting circumstances.

"
6144,4 june 2017,aries,"Break out the cozy sweat pants and hot tea, the juicy novels and the comfort food. Mars moves into your warm and fuzzy fourth house of domesticity and nostalgia. Cribbing Dorothy Gale’s line, “there’s no place like home”, you may feel more like nesting in your abode rather than going out on the town over the next four weeks. If you do go out you might be heading to the Container Store or Bed, Bath and Beyond in an effort to turn your place into a more stylish and organized home. Talks about moving in with a lover or starting a family could come up, so get ready for changes on the home front.

"
6145,5 june 2017,aries,"Dust off the old BS meter and set it for “high”. Might as well get out the hip waders while you’re at it, it could be deep today. Just make sure that it’s not coming from your end! Be a straight shooter, even if others aren’t. Turn on your Spidey sense and dig deep into what others are saying or doing. Don’t be obvious about it: use your intuition to your advantage.

"
6146,6 june 2017,aries,"Stability. We all crave it, and now it’s time for you to grab on to it and hold it tight. That’s because sweet Venus, planet of love (and profits!), moves into grounded Taurus. Whether you’re searching for guarantees in romance or your career, the next few weeks are excellent for putting your foot down and demanding them. But you won’t have to yell or be aggressive: this is more about being the iron hand in the velvet glove.

"
6147,7 june 2017,aries,"You’re in brainiac mode this week as a full moon takes place Friday in the lofty, philosophical ninth house. This is where we think big, on a conceptual level. It’s as if we’re standing on a mountaintop and can see the sprawling vista of our lives from a unique vantage point. And today intelligent Mercury enters the other  house of thinking, the highly strategic third house. No matter what challenges you’re facing you’re now in an awesome spot to figure out solutions.

"
6148,8 june 2017,aries,"How you relate to others could use a little tweaking, Aries! A more gentle, subdued manner is the best way to communicate with, be it verbally or in writing. Your ability to intuit what people are thinking is excellent, not to mention reading their body language for subtle cues. Pay closer attention to what others say rather than doing all of the talking.

"
6149,9 june 2017,aries,"Big day in the cosmos as a full moon illuminates your forward thinking house of coloring outside the lines! If life has been way too predictable it’s time to shake things up with some changes, which may include a more optimistic attitude. Even though this is known as the house of risk taking, practical Saturn is in a good angle, ensuring that you don’t do anything too stupid. By all means, take a chance—on love, starting your own business, changing your look or traveling around the world. You may be wrapping up a number of other projects, so finish them so that you can move on to some juicier stuff.

"
6150,10 june 2017,aries,"Relief at last! Mighty Jupiter has just resumed direct motion in your relationship sector after a four-month nap. Singles, you may have stayed away from love or found it difficult to make progress within a dating situation. Couples may have been overloaded with work demands and stress, unable to spend quality time together. Fortunately this period is over, and as Jupiter is the planet of abundance and optimism, you can expect matters of the heart to develop momentum.

"
6151,11 june 2017,aries,"You’re in a playful mood, and why not? Spontaneous Uranus is urging you to do something enjoyable today. Indulge in a hobby, take on a new sport, go to a movie or try a new restaurant. Life is short–get out there and enjoy it!

"
6152,12 june 2017,aries,"You know the saying: karma can be a b****. But today it could also be your best friend! You don’t have to settle in love, nor should you. It appears from your chart that the cosmos is ready to bless you with some overdue goodies when it comes to matters of the heart. It could mean conceiving a baby, finding a soulmate or realizing how much someone loves you. I suppose you also might hear that your ex is now living a life of hell with his/her new “love”. Silently wish them well and move on with your fab life!

"
6153,13 june 2017,aries,"A battle could erupt among key players in your life, whether that means people in the office or a loved one. It looks like someone has their bossy pants on and wants to stir up trouble (hopefully that’s not you….but it could be!). Don’t lose your sense of optimism or take things they say to heart. With intelligent Mercury in your thinking sector you should be able to see right through what’s going on.

"
6154,14 june 2017,aries,"Great day for researching or launching an online endeavor: Etsy store, website, social media campaign, coding an app, you name it. Saturn, the planet that builds strength into any situation it’s involved in, is sparkling in your visionary ninth house of going global. Group efforts can also gain momentum, so lead the charge and get everyone thinking about new ways of approaching your end goal.

"
6155,15 june 2017,aries,"Don’t make promises you can’t keep! You may be overly optimistic about what you can deliver, Aries. From your chart it appears that more thought and planning needs to go into something of interest to you. With Neptune about to retrograde, remaining logical is going to be a main priority for you over the next five months.

"
6156,16 june 2017,aries,"Keeping things real is going to be a major focus for you over the next five months, Aries! Dreamy Neptune begins to retrograde in your highly emotional twelfth house, the place where daydreams and fantasies reside. As a result you could indulge in escapist thinking—not a good thing. Also, don’t kid yourself about health issues or habits that aren’t good for you. This can be an incredibly inspirational time, though, if you channel your mind the right way.

"
6157,17 june 2017,aries,"Cleanse your soul of past dramas and hurts. A cathartic Moon-Chiron aspect will work wonders for your psyche, and as Chiron is the wounded healer, it’s time to toss out old mindsets that no longer work for you. There is no dignity in being a martyr, unless you’re Joan of Arc or a biblical figure. Personally, I’d rather not get burned at the stake.

"
6158,18 june 2017,aries,"Great day to call someone close and go out for brunch, head to the beach, have cocktails or trawl some art galleries. Spontaneity rules with unpredictable Uranus in a happy mood. Save your chores for another day.

"
6159,19 june 2017,aries,"Unless you’re absolutely sure about something, don’t say anything. A harsh Mercury-Saturn aspect warns you to be circumspect about statements you make, along with any promises on your part. Signing a legal contract? All the more reason to be careful. Get more background information before you put your signature on paper.

"
6160,20 june 2017,aries,"Sometimes it seems to take forever for wisdom to sink in; other times it can happen in the blink of an eye. A sparkling Mercury-Uranus aspect today allows for a sudden flash of understanding to occur, something that can help you enormously.

No need for drama—calm logic will work just fine, thank you.

"
6162,22 june 2017,aries,"Why are you holding things in? Now that verbal Mercury is in one of the most sensitive and emotional parts of your chart, the time is ripe for letting people know what you’re thinking—and how you feel. Reach out and touch someone.

Singles could find a keeper, someone who’s established financially with a mature attitude. All of this can happen over the next six months…a great way to close out 2017!

"
6165,25 june 2017,aries,"Sometimes it’s better to keep personal information just that–personal. People around you may feel as though they’re entitled to know all of the details of your life, but the more they know the more they can interfere. Unless you want a lot of unsolicited opinions, keep some things to yourself.

"
6166,26 june 2017,aries,"There are times to keep your emotions in check and times when you should be openly expressing them. A helpful Mars-Neptune aspect encourages you to speak up and get everything out there. By the same token, someone close may need to vent, so be a good listener and keep their remarks confidential. Neptune is active in your house of privacy.

"
6167,26 june 2016,aries,"Hitch your wagon upon a star! Think long and hard about whom you could connect with or impress, as the contacts you make right now could carry your career forward for years to come. A powerful Pluto-Jupiter trine could bring them in. This planetary event won’t happen again until 2024 so don’t take it lightly.

"
6168,27 june 2017,aries,"Is martyrdom your thing? How about being a doormat, an enabler or a victim? No, you say? Good. Intelligent Mercury is knocking some sense into your head about just how much nonsense you should be putting up with. Very little, in fact.

"
6169,27 june 2016,aries,"“I’m bringing sexy back.”  That’s your song o’ the day, Aries, as lusty Mars finally moves direct in your house of libido and intimacy! And with Mercury moving into your domestic zone, it’s time for some canoodling at home. You don’t need to head off to a swank hotel or a romantic B & B for amour; just make your pad more posh and luxe. Satin sheets, anyone?

"
6170,28 june 2017,aries,"Need to get something off your chest? Today’s the day to do so with a powerful Mercury/Mars conjunction. They meet in your fourth house, the place where we crave contentment and stability. Resolve matters as best you can with family members or even an ex. This is no time to hope that things will improve on their own. Take ownership of a problem and let people know exactly how you feel.

"
6171,28 june 2016,aries,"The Moon in your sign is stirring you up, telling you that you need to pay attention to making your life more streamlined and stress-free. Sometimes you just have to let go of the “big picture”, the five-year plan, and just worry about today. The better you handle your daily chores and assignments, the easier it will be to achieve the bigger plans.

"
6172,29 june 2017,aries,"Someone may come on strong, therefore undermining your sense of security or feeling of contentment. You may be tempted to defend yourself or try to reason with this person, but you’ll only be wasting your breath. Let it slide. You have such awesome planetary aspects for finding peace and happiness that you can’t let someone else’s problems influence your experience of the day.

"
6173,29 june 2016,aries,"Don’t be surprised if you do a complete 180 today, especially when it comes to your career. On a grand scale, you could decide to chuck it all and run off to join the circus (metaphorically speaking). Or you could simply decide to take your company in a new direction, going online instead of brick and mortar. You could set your cap on a different kind of client or change up the way you do presentations. The good news is that your ideas hold promise.

"
6174,30 june 2017,aries,"Don’t assume that a loved one knows how you feel about them. With the Moon in a passionate, expressive place today, verbalize your feelings. However, this isn’t the right time to push for an answer or for someone to make a decision. Wait until after the 4th of July.

"
6175,30 june 2016,aries,"How much control do you need to give up in order to be happy in a relationship with another human being? Whether it’s work, love or a friendship, today’s planetary aspects will ask you that question. Some people are better at flying solo than others and chafe under restrictions. Others need more reassurance and a strong hand to guide them. With the recent full moon in the most independent part of your chart, chances are you’re craving more freedom.

"
6176,1 july 2017,aries,"Changing the rules of your romance is on the cosmos’s agenda today. Perhaps you need to spend more time with your lover, or household duties need to be divvied up more evenly. Singles, maybe you need to revise your opinion about who the perfect person is. Once charismatic Venus enters Gemini on the 4th it will be far easier to make this happen.

"
6177,1 july 2016,aries,"Despite the fact that the weekend is upon us, the cosmos is getting ready to deliver some goodies to you in the form of better working conditions, higher pay or juicier assignments. You’re going to have to seek them out–they won’t just fall into your lap–but if you’re willing to put in the effort, you’ll get the results. This energy carries out well onto mid-July, and the end game is to provide you with greater security and peace of mind.

"
6178,2 july 2017,aries,"Who’s wearing their bossy pants today? As stubborn Mars opposes subterranean Pluto, someone could have quite the attitude–hopefully not you. It’s also possible that your work load is getting to you, making you feel as though you’ll never be able to spare enough time for your own personal pursuits or your family. This energy will reappear again later in July, so be prepared to work through it.

"
6179,2 july 2016,aries,"Planetary influences indicate that some long overdue changes need to be made in your family or personal relationships, and that now is the time to address them. The good news is that a new moon on Monday in this part of the sky will help you take care of issues and lay them to rest, once and for all.

"
6180,3 july 2017,aries,"Taking care of family matters may be first and foremost in your mind as the Sun and Mars both blaze a path through your domestic fourth house. Today’s a smart time to speak your piece as aspects later in the week could make communication difficult. Someone may be digging in their heels, and chances are it’s not you. With gentle Venus about to enter Gemini your level of diplomacy will only increase.

"
6181,3 july 2016,aries,"You’re more than ready to dump dramas from the past, especially where your family is concerned. Daddy issues, mommy meltdowns, whacked out siblings–it’s time to let it all go, and the helpful trine today between the Sun and Neptune will get things rolling. Tomorrow’s new moon in your domestic sector will get the ball rolling.

"
6182,4 july 2017,aries,"Life should get a lot sweeter and more sociable now that charismatic Venus is in your house of mingling with others. You can use this friendly energy in any way you please: to catch up with old friends, play with your kids, find a new lover (face to face beats online) or schmooze some industry contacts. Venus will be here til the 31st, so get out there and enjoy yourself.

"
6183,4 july 2016,aries,"With two upbeat planets moving through the sky supporting today’s new moon in Cancer, a new chapter opens up that can bring you much joy and contentment. Saturn is in fine angle, promising that if you put effort into your dreams, that you will be able to achieve them. It won’t happen overnight, and you’ll have to work hard, but success can be yours…and the peace of mind that accompanies it.

"
6184,5 july 2017,aries,"Don’t pay attention to what people say–pay attention to what they do. Your intuition is in fine form, enabling you to see past the smoke screens that others may have up. It’s not so much that people are trying to deceive you, but rather they’re being unrealistic or are ill informed.

"
6185,5 july 2016,aries,"If you have to work out an issue with a parent or older relative, Mercury is in your corner. Use your intuition to help guide you through the situation, as it should be strong. You may not have been getting the full story, but with today’s aspects you should be able to get to the bottom of the matter.

"
6186,6 july 2017,aries,"You may need to be the person who takes ownership of a family, love or housing issue, thanks to the Sun in your serenity-driven fourth house. You’re in no mood these days for endless dramas that seem to drag on, and the people in your world need to figure that out. They will, too–at the time of this Saturday’s full moon in Capricorn, which takes place in your house of authority.

"
6187,7 july 2017,aries,"People could have advice for you, and if that’s the case you would be wise to take heed. Some of it may be just what you need to hear right now. Your intuition is strong, thanks to vibey Neptune in the house of the subconscious mind, but it certainly won’t hurt to get another opinion.

"
6188,7 july 2016,aries,"Who’s the boss? Two oppositions and a square today pit your sense of contentment and security against people around you who seem to want to run the show. Be careful that you don’t erupt in anger or frustration, as unpredictable Uranus could push your buttons. And the reality is that you may have to deal with a supervisor (not a power-hungry wannabe) who is critical and on edge. Let it slide, because things improve on Friday.

"
6189,8 july 2017,aries,"The full moon in Capricorn raises your profile and lends you prestige, Aries. And why not? You’ve been working hard and you deserve it. This lunation could bring a project to a successful finale, and be a turning point for fulfilling new ambitions that pop into your head.

"
6190,8 july 2016,aries,"Something could happen today that will make you feel more contented about your work environment. Perhaps the office diva gets canned, or the boss gives you better technological tools to work with. A client could praise your work or your resume could land on just the right desk. Whatever it is, you’re moving into a period of greater security. But it won’t happen all by itself—you will be actively engaged in this process.

"
6191,9 july 2017,aries,"Family responsibilities may be weighing on you, and frustration may be mounting as you try to balance work and personal demands. Truth be told, this vibe will continue as the month goes on, reoccurring on the 17th and the 20th. Work your way through it, Aries, because relief (and fun!) arrives on the 20th when Mars roars into frisky, life-affirming Leo.

"
6192,9 july 2016,aries,"Feeling fine! An optimistic Moon-Jupiter angle bodes well for an improvement in vitality and fitness. With so many planets in your domestic fourth house, cocooning at home is what the doctor orders, along with eating healthier foods and working out. Tearing around the neighborhood on errands and putting in late hours at the job have to be scaled back.

"
6193,10 july 2017,aries,"Touchy! The slightest remark could set you off with a Sun-Pluto opposition. Chances are you’ve been working hard, too hard, and you need some down time. That said, if someone is coming on too strong with an inappropriate remark you may need to set them in their place.

"
6194,10 july 2016,aries,"With the Sun in Cancer and aligning with Jupiter in Virgo, this is a great time to make progress around the house and garden. While beautifying your surroundings makes for a more enjoyable environment, don’t overlook the peace of mind that comes from having organized drawers and closets!

"
6195,11 july 2017,aries,"Getting other people to support your ideas gets easier today thanks to a happy Moon-Jupiter trine. Better yet is that they may decide to get on board with you, so you’ll be able to move forward with a partner rather than going it all alone.

"
6196,11 july 2016,aries,"Wrap up any home or family related dramas or disputes, as communicative Mercury is getting ready to move on to another part of your chart. Whether it’s a problem with a parent, kid, contractor, roommate, real estate agent or landlord, try to settle it now. This issue could reappear on Saturday. Who needs the agita?

"
6197,12 july 2017,aries,"Slow down a bit today and give more thought to where you’re heading. The recent full moon was in your g0-go-go house of ambition, but rushing in without enough intel could screw things up. You also need time for your creative juices to start flowing, which they will, thanks to Mercury in your house of talent.

"
6198,12 july 2016,aries,"Summer is here and the living is easy! That’s your motto over the next five weeks, Aries, as planets start gliding into Leo, the sign of fun, frolic and luxury. Fortunately for you, love planet Venus goes there today, stirring up your desire to dazzle, laugh and mingle. Single rams could find new love and committed ones could enter into a flirty new phase. Oh, and by the way—the stork could visit too! Plan accordingly.

"
6199,13 july 2017,aries,"Need inspiration? Then go within, Aries, as a dynamic Moon-Neptune meeting stirs up your creative juices. It can also stir up your passion and, uh, other  juices so if you’re feeling amorous….get a room!

"
6200,13 july 2016,aries,"We’re all communicating, whether we realize it or not. The way we dress, speak and carry ourselves speaks volumes. Even the most casual conversations reveal who we are. Well, expressive Mercury enters the most creative part of your chart today, urging you to present yourself in a more innovative manner. Whether it’s term papers, business reports, your blog or your wardrobe, start jazzing things up a little bit.

"
6201,14 july 2017,aries,"Where is this relationship going? It’s time for one of those talks and optimistic Jupiter has your back. Naturally this kind of chat can occur in a romance, but today’s cosmic energy is also auspicious for asking the same question in a business alliance.

"
6202,14 july 2016,aries,"Deep emotions could bubble to the surface as spontaneous Uranus and aggressive Mars meet in the heavens. You have a choice: get angry over past hurts and dramas, or release them. The angle between these two orbs suggests that you reframe your thinking, taking on a different viewpoint. Sometimes that’s all it takes.

"
6203,15 july 2017,aries,"Your intuition will be spot on today, so don’t be afraid to use it. With Mars lighting up your house of family and close relationships, your inner wisdom can help you figure out what’s going on in the mind of a relative, roommate or lover.

"
6204,15 july 2016,aries,"Long-term plans get a boost today from a Moon-Saturn meetup. While La Luna provides you with the passion to put into your dreams, Saturn makes sure that you don’t cross over into Lala Land with crazy schemes that won’t pan out.

"
6205,16 july 2017,aries,"Playing nice with everyone, just to keep the peace, won’t be in the cosmic picture today, Aries! As the Moon forms a tight angle with rebellious Uranus, you’re going to be interested in taking care of #1. Nothing wrong with that! It’s about time.

"
6206,16 july 2016,aries,"Temper, temper! Combustable Uranus flares up in your self-esteem sector, making you sensitive to the words and antics of others. No problem though. A confident Mercury-Venus meetup will allow you to vent in a constructive manner, especially where kids or a lover are involved. Count to ten, breathe, then calmly state your position.

"
6207,17 july 2017,aries,"Touchy! Watch your temper (and your words) as you appear to be a bit thin skinned today. The slightest provocation from someone could set you off, so count to ten and chill out. Tomorrow is a better time for communication.

"
6208,17 july 2016,aries,"Intense emotions could bubble to the surface, but this is beneficial. A happy trine between Mars and Chiron, the wounded healer, is encouraging you to get to the root of unease, face fears and acknowledge your true feelings. Tuesday’s full moon in the most take-charge part of your chart will help you step into your own power.

"
6209,18 july 2017,aries,"Great day to get your point across, especially if you need the cooperation of others. Venus is not only the planet of love but the planet of profits, and it’s winking at optimistic Jupiter across the heavens. You can score big in both romance and business.

"
6210,18 july 2016,aries,"Since most of us spend the majority of our waking hours working for a living, what we do—and how much we enjoy it—is of paramount importance. A Pluto-Moon convo will find you thinking long and hard about your level of contentment. If you’re working at a soul-sucking job, or you’re unemployed, tomorrow’s full moon in your ambition sector sets the stage for change. Relatively happy? Then you can make incredible progress in the six months ahead.

"
6211,19 july 2017,aries,"Need to seal a deal? Whether you’re applying for a mortgage, asking someone out on a date or showing your art portfolio to a gallery owner, today’s cosmic energy rocks for putting together a long-term, happy arrangement.

"
6212,19 july 2016,aries,"Got ambition? If so, tonight’s full moon will out a smile on your face. It falls in your house of success and kudos and is wonderfully supported by Saturn. The ringed planet’s presence indicates that whatever you work on now will have ramifications for years to come, so choose wisely. Whether you change companies, take on a new leadership position or go the entrepreneurial route, you’ll come out a winner.

"
6213,20 july 2017,aries,"Purrrrr, pussy cat! Lusty Mars enters Leo, your fifth house of romance and enjoying the sweeter things in life. Singles can find new love and coupled up Aries can savor some juicier date nights (and boudoir activities). The Sun is just about to join Mars, so between these two you should really enjoy the month ahead.

"
6214,20 july 2016,aries,"You’re the envy of the zodiac, Aries, with romantic Venus in the house of love! And the Sun heads into the same spot on Friday. If you’ve been looking for love in all the wrong places, or your current relationship is lackluster, today’s powerful Venus-Saturn trine is all about finding love that lasts, with an exciting edge to it. Security in romance does not have to mean “boring”–keep that in mind.

"
6215,21 july 2017,aries,"What you want and what others around you are hoping for may be two different things today. Feeling pressured into playing along with someone else’s agenda could bring out a rebellious streak. But before you flip out, ask yourself if there is any merit to what others are up to.

"
6216,21 july 2016,aries,"The best way to get things done right now is through team effort. Agree with another mom to babysit your kids while you run errands, join a marathon training group, bring in consultants or mentors at the office. Not only will you become more efficient, you’ll free up time for fun–a bonus, considering that the Sun enters frisky Leo tomorrow!

"
6217,22 july 2017,aries,"A fabulous new chapter is about to open in romance, thanks to the fiery Sun gliding into Leo today. Over the next four weeks you can enjoy the company of not only a lover but your kids too, as they are part of this sector. But don’t forget to take care of #1 with some well-earned pampering, a Leo specialty.

"
6218,22 july 2016,aries,"Sweet! The Sun enters your house of love, down time and creativity. It joins Mercury and Venus, which are already trying to bring more romance and inspiration your way. With dreamy Neptune in your mysterious twelfth house, chances are you’re day dreaming about the kind of love and life you want to enjoy. Take those dreams and run with them.

"
6219,23 july 2017,aries,"Just how happy do you want to be? The new moon in Leo, your house of romance and enjoying life, can  kick open up a wonderful phase. But Uranus is acting up in your house of self. What’s the matter–do you think you don’t deserve the good things in life? Guess again!

"
6220,23 july 2016,aries,"Hey there, mind reader. A powerful Moon-Neptune conjunction helps you suss out what’s going on in the head of a lover or child. This has a positive vibe around it that lasts into the week ahead. Wednesday is particularly good for communicating with someone close to you.

"
6221,24 july 2017,aries,"Reaching an agreement about long term dreams or goals could be difficult today. Likewise, you may discover that someone in your personal or business world doesn’t share the same values. Thursday and Friday are much better days to get on the same page–if that’s a possibility.

"
6222,24 july 2016,aries,"Your passion for life should be apparent today, thanks to the Moon entering Aries. It forms a glorious angle with the Sun, telling you to schedule in more quality time for love, hobbies, sports, and attending cultural events.

Fortunately, smart little Mercury has your back for the next five weeks. Use its energy to streamline, simplify and then chill out.

"
6224,25 july 2016,aries,"Ouch! Watch what you say to a person in a place of authority, as a tough Moon-Pluto square could make you say something you’ll regret. This holds true not only for verbal statements, but anything you put in writing. This is not the day to troll, rant or tell the cop who just pulled you over that you’re paying his salary. If you need to talk to the boss, wait until tomorrow or Wednesday.

"
6225,26 july 2017,aries,"Go for it! A powerful meet up of the Sun and Mars tells you to let your freak flag fly. Ask someone out on a date, dye your hair red, sign up for art classes, flirt outrageously and go window shopping for a brand new look. Super day for finding new love, rekindling an existing romance or conceiving a baby!

"
6226,26 july 2016,aries,"Recent events may have found you in “should I stay or should I go” mode when it comes to your career. Today, the Moon forms a benevolent angle with mutable Pluto, stirring up thoughts about your financial security and income level. If you want to see change, it can happen.

"
6227,27 july 2017,aries,"It’s time to get real about a relationship issue, and now that the Moon is in your house of serious alliances you can. There’s a fine line between living purely on passion and maintaining a practical viewpoint. Make sure that you’re listening to your head as much as your heart.

"
6228,27 july 2016,aries,"A bold Uranus-Mercury trine is going to encourage you to speak up in matters of the heart. Singles, you may be ready to take a chance again in love. Hiding in the shadows never helped anyone, Aries! Seek out the happiness you crave and deserve.

"
6229,28 july 2017,aries,"Pessimism about other people starts to melt away, and a more hopeful and happy attitude takes its place. Maybe it’s because you’re starting to realize that true happiness comes from within, and doesn’t have to be held hostage by outside events and others.

"
6230,28 july 2016,aries,"Stop, start, stop, start.  A wonky mix of planetary angles is creating this effect, forcing you to question which step to take next. The Moon in Taurus pleads for security, yet Uranus in your sign is saying, “Go for it!” And intelligent Mercury is squaring Mars in the moody part of your chart. This vibe will continue for a few days, so hold off on making any major decisions.

"
6231,29 july 2017,aries,"Cue the Rolling Stones: “You can’t always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you may get just what you need!” That’s the message from the cosmos as you may initially feel like obstacles are in your path. But by tomorrow you could be pleasantly surprised by what happens next.

"
6232,29 july 2016,aries,"Who are you, really? That question will be on your mind over the next five months as Uranus retrogrades in your house of self-image. Uranus is the maverick of the solar system, challenging the status quo and pushing the proverbial envelope. The key is to discover who you really are and to bring this new and improved version of yourself to the world without burning bridges and going over the top.

"

"
6234,30 july 2016,aries,"It’s time to clean house, literally and metaphorically. Intelligent Mercury buzzes into your house of efficiency and de-stressing for the next few weeks. Bring order to your home and work place by clearing out files, desks and closets. Knock out tasks that have been on your to-do list forever. And since your body is a temple, you need to keep that structure clean too: vitamins, plenty of water, nutritious foods and deep restful sleep are on the agenda.

"
6235,31 july 2017,aries,"Expressing your inner truth becomes far easier now that gentle Venus is in Cancer. Your sense of confidence and contentment will rise as you express yourself more deeply to loved ones. Romance can blossom too under this aspect, as well as domestic matters.

"
6236,31 july 2016,aries,"If someone tries to throw their weight around you won’t be in the mood for putting up with it! A Moon-Pluto opposition could possibly threaten your sense of security, emotional or otherwise. But don’t become emotional. Your intuition is in rare form today–use it to figure out what’s going on in the other person’s head.

"
6237,1 august 2017,aries,"Feeling more relaxed about your life is quite possible thanks to some positive lunar energy, and this is a good thing. You’ll be more likely to take an educated risk or a chance on something that has appealed to you without breaking the bank or doing something foolish.

"
6238,1 august 2016,aries,"Get off the fence! Two fabulous trines in your love sector tell you to put a ring on it or to make more serious plans. Singles, get off your duff and head to where people congregate, and I’m not talking about a watering hole. Museums, concerts, outdoor plays, street fairs, the beach, the park–these are your best places for bumping into a new flame.

"
6239,2 august 2017,aries,"Long term plans get a healthy boost as passion meets practicality. Use the first three weeks of August to develop momentum, and then get ready for the brakes to come off on the 25th when Saturn resumes direct motion.

"
6240,2 august 2016,aries,"Ready to shine in the spotlight? With the new moon in your house of recognition, and energetic Mars moving into blue-skies-ahead Sag, all eyes will be on you! Give ’em  something to  talk about, Aries. It’s time to bust out of an old self-image that just doesn’t fit you anymore.

"
6241,3 august 2017,aries,"Watch the attitude there, skippy! Erratic Uranus begins a five-month retrograde in your house of self–which could make you a wee bit pushy (or dare I say arrogant?). You also need to carefully think through personal initiatives during this time period; don’t leap in too quickly without doing your homework.

"
6242,3 august 2016,aries,"Slow down there, skippy! A strong Uranus-Moon angle is firing you up to after some pretty sweet dreams and passions. With planets in frisky, fun Leo, you’re feeling adventurous and ready to take a gamble. But you need to consider the details, the small stuff, the routines and habits you’ll need in order to get the results you want. Patience.

"
6243,4 august 2017,aries,"Don’t let a lover or family member use guilt or strong arm tactics in order to get you to do things their way. It’s time to rewrite those old, tired scripts that your family unit has been reciting anyway. When Mercury retrogrades on the 12th, you’ll be so done  with this kind of nonsense.

"
6244,4 august 2016,aries,"Buh-bye, inertia! With the Moon buzzing past Venus and Mercury in the most efficient part of your chart, your desire to tackle projects is on the rise. The next six weeks are awesome for pulling your life together, whether that means balancing the checkbook, getting on a diet (and sticking with it), or completely revamping how you handle your work flow. Just don’t rush it this week. Plan before you act.

"
6245,5 august 2017,aries,"A little creative thinking may be necessary in order to work through problems that have been of concern. Handling people and issues the same old way as before will only get you the same results. Fortunately with inspirational Neptune active in your intuition sector, you should be able to hit upon a smart solution.

"
6246,5 august 2016,aries,"An interesting period in your work life opens up as Venus enters your house of office environment and co-workers. While you’ll be able to outwardly get along with them and act the part of a team player, your intuition will be actively picking up on who’s not. You may even see signs of dissension among the group in the week ahead as they may not be able to agree on projects. No worries, however. Your ability to impress higher-ups is strong.

"
6247,6 august 2017,aries,"You may find yourself in a situation in which you need to lay down the law with someone, whether you really want to do it or not! And it could be someone close, so remain diplomatic as you set new boundaries. It’s also possible that the other person is overly optimistic with their expectations, which you need to address.

"
6248,6 august 2016,aries,"Can’t see the forest for the trees? Or maybe all you can focus on is the clearing ahead so that you can get the heck out of the forest. A friction-filled standoff between planets in Virgo and others in Sagittarius is creating a situation in which you’re mentally boggled down. It’s details versus the big picture, today’s needs versus those of the future. Take a deep breath and count to ten. Clarity starts to return early in the week.

"
6249,7 august 2017,aries,"Making new connections is in the stars as tonight’s lunar eclipse occurs in your networking sector. A group endeavor that you’ve been working on may come to a successful close, and now some fresh opportunities could come your way.

"
6250,7 august 2016,aries,"With Venus and Mercury in your efficient sixth house, duty is calling your name. Problem is, you may be getting so anxious to get things done that frustration is building. Neptune is making you wonder if your plans and goals will be reached. Have no fear–this will pass. When Saturn goes direct on Saturday, your ability to move forward with stress-free confidence will rise.

"
6251,8 august 2017,aries,"Yesterday’s lunar eclipse fell in your house of networking, and today a rather sudden connection could be made–a positive one! Keep your mind open to meeting different kinds of people, as Mars could bring more fun, creative types into your world.

"
6252,8 august 2016,aries,"A sparking angle between the Moon and Chiron enables you to get to the root of things that have been troubling you, Aries. Whether you decide to sort them out on your own or share them with a close confidante is up to you. It appears that your little brain has been hashing the same things over and over again in recent weeks. That could be due to Saturn’s retrograde spin in your ninth house of expansion, but good news: the ringed planet goes direct this Saturday.

"
6253,9 august 2017,aries,"Taking a creative risk, especially in your career, is often what leads to big breakthroughs. And today the time is right to consider how to be more assertive and ground-breaking with your ideas. Better yet, showcase your talents to the boss or the marketplace; you may be more successful than you expect.

"
6254,9 august 2016,aries,"A happy angle between the Moon and Venus sheds light on a situation that you have been trying to resolve (or take action on) for some time now. Both your gut and your head will be active, so take guidance from both. Your deep feelings and strong emotions can help guide you down a logical path.

"
6255,10 august 2017,aries,"Working together as a team becomes a heck of a lot easier thanks to six  orbs in the solar system all forming helpful aspects. This is true within the family unit, at work or with a lover. By all means reach out to others and make things happen–before Mercury retrogrades on Saturday!

"
6256,10 august 2016,aries,"The next few days are some of the best in a long while to present your ideas to higher-ups. Intelligent Mercury is pointing out ways in which you can do the job smarter, better and more efficiently. Plan meetings and client presentations to showcase your brainstorms. The 17th also rocks for doing the same.

"
6257,11 august 2017,aries,"Sshhh! Keep things to yourself at the office, especially if you’re job hunting. Loose lips will sink your ship. The same goes for office gossip–avoid it. What’s the reason for the concern? Mercury retrogrades tomorrow in your workplace sector, and a tough Neptune opposition indicates that there could be hidden trolls in your midst.

"
6258,11 august 2016,aries,"You need to do a little more digging, Aries, when it comes to analyzing an idea you’ve been considering. With intelligent Mercury in your efficiency sector, you will be able to come up with a practical, workable plan. It may require you to take on some new habits, protocols or technologies, but the outlook for success is high.

"
6259,12 august 2017,aries,"Yum! A super romantic weekend arrives with the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, winking at each other across the heavens. It’s wonderful for some alone time with your amour, a time for discussing your deepest feelings and wishes. Singles are in a good spot to meet someone new, most likely face to face rather than online.

"
6260,12 august 2016,aries,"Aries folks will venture where angels fear to tread, so telling you to take a chance is like waving a red flag at el toro. Nonetheless, the cosmos is  telling you to jazz things up a little bit by taking a risk in the day-to-day stuff. For example, if your standard exercise routine is running, rent a surfboard and catch some waves. Salespeople–try new prospecting methods. Instead of buying the usual produce, head to the farmer’s market and take home some heirloom tomatoes. Live a little!

"
6261,13 august 2017,aries,"Taking risks gets a heck of a lot saner with structured Saturn in a good spot to protect you. Whether it’s in love, business or a personal endeavor that means a lot to you, it’s easier to stick your neck out—and actually see some happy results for your efforts.

"
6262,13 august 2016,aries,"Welcome news: Saturn resumes direct motion in your optimistic ninth house of travel, study, publishing and other high falutin’ plans you’ve got cooked up. Over the past five months there was a “back to the old drawing board” feeling here as stern Saturn wanted to make sure that your future plans are solid. They should be now, and with Mars in the same part of the sky, your desire and ambition should begin to soar.

"
6263,14 august 2017,aries,"Where’s this relationship going? With the Moon and Venus forming a sweet angle in the most security-driven parts of your chart, you could receive answers to that question today. It’s also a good time to create greater financial abundance, which will only add to your overall stability.

"
6264,14 august 2016,aries,"You may be questioning the best way to go about completing or tackling a project. You have the motivation, but something is holding you back–and it’s called Neptune. The watery planet may be casting doubts in your mind as to the best way to go about things. Take your time; a Venus-Pluto trine on Wednesday will clear things up for you.

"
6265,15 august 2017,aries,"Reaching an agreement with someone won’t be easy today with a Venus-Pluto opposition. Trying to force matters won’t work, nor will sitting back and letting someone walk all over you. This energy continues for a few days: wait until Friday to reach an accord.

"
6266,15 august 2016,aries,"Career matters soar this week and today could bring about some interesting changes. The Moon holds a conversation with power broker Pluto, whose job it is to point out the flaws in a situation so that you can fix them. Sometimes this means starting over from scratch; other times you just need to tweak a bit. But your attitude toward your occupation is changing. Is it time for something new?

"
6267,16 august 2017,aries,"What’s the point of hashing over bright ideas in your brain, and not setting them in motion? It’s time to take things from the dream stage to reality. If you’re waiting for the “right moment”, it’s here. It’s now.

"
6268,16 august 2016,aries,"Uranus is known as the planet of genius and innovation, and today it has your back in a big way. It forms an amazing trine, the best angle possible, with the Sun in your house of creativity. Flashes of brilliance could come your way, so pay attention. Whether you pen the next Harry Potter-type series of books, patent the next Spanx, or code a hot app, your grey matter can deliver today.

"
6269,17 august 2017,aries,"Two of the most optimistic planets in the solar system, Venus and Jupiter, are at odds today….but it’s just a temporary blip on the cosmic radar. However, you may temporarily feel misunderstood or thrown off balance somehow. Things improve tomorrow when a lunar aspect helps you realize that you have nothing to worry about.

"
6270,17 august 2016,aries,"Uranus has a job to do: shaking up your self-image. And it will do so today with zest, teaming up with the Sun to help you revamp your attitude and appearance. The upside of this? Your love life can take an unexpected turn for the better. Happy, unexpected twists and turns in romance could happen, so doll yourself up and head out the door.

"
6271,18 august 2017,aries,"Open up and be more vulnerable with the ones you love, Aries. Sometimes we become so busy with our daily responsibilities that we forget (or we’re too tired) to display affection and have a heartfelt talk. Today opens up the floodgates.

"
6272,18 august 2016,aries,"Joining forces with others is the message behind today’s full moon in Aquarius. Whether you’re looking for a new job, trying to arrange play dates for the kids or embarking on a fitness plan, by reaching out and teaming up with likeminded folks you can make a heck of a lot of progress. Oh, and buddies can be quite  instrumental in finding you new love.

"
6273,19 august 2017,aries,"With Monday’s solar eclipse getting ever closer, you may be feeling reticent about changes that you know need to be made. Despite your sign’s independent spirit, taking a risk may seem too dicey right now. That’s OK–by Tuesday your confidence will rebound.

"
6274,19 august 2016,aries,"Climbing the ladder will be an easier task if you network with others. Yesterday’s full moon encouraged you to cast your net far and wide. But a Moon-Venus opposition today recommends that you keep your plans quiet as far as co-workers are concerned. It’s also a smart move to keep brilliant ideas to yourself, and to only share them with decision makers.

"
6275,20 august 2016,aries,"Can’t see the forest for the trees. That describes you today, Aries, as a Moon-Venus opposition clouds your vision. You may be too close to a situation to view it objectively. Your best bet is to focus your attention on something else (preferably pleasurable) and wait til next Wednesday for greater clarity.

"
6276,21 august 2016,aries,"As Mars and Saturn move ever closer to each other in your enterprising ninth house, your energy level should be rising. Big projects or tasks are looking less daunting and a can-do attitude is developing, overcoming inertia. Can it get any better than this? Yes! The Moon in Aries forms a wonderful angle to these two, helping put a nice dose of passion into whatever it is that you’re deciding to undertake.

"
6277,22 august 2016,aries,"Bragging rights! Today’s a good time to let the boss and clients know just how good you really are (with a touch of humility, of course). Although they may already know that, thanks to three beneficial planets hovering in your house of efficiency. With a conjunction between lucky Jupiter and chatty Mercury, you could hear job-related news that puts a smile on your face. And with the Sun entering this part of the sky today too, your productivity will be off the charts.

"
6278,23 august 2016,aries,"An idea or project that you’ve been working on is gaining steam, courtesy of Mars and Saturn meeting in your enterprising house of big visions and possibilities. But you may need to revise a budget or the protocols surrounding it. Get clear on what has to be done, when, and by whom–and how you’re going to pay for it.

"
6279,24 august 2016,aries,"If you’re going to set off on a journey, you’re going to need a good map. That’s the message the stars have for you today as power brokers Mars and Saturn meet up in your freewheeling ninth house of adventure and lofty goals. You can’t just run willy nilly into the sunset; you need a routine and a plan to take you there. Fortunately a positive lunar aspect helps you get in touch with your efficient side.

"
6280,25 august 2016,aries,"Your confidence about how to proceed with a particular plan may flag as doubts get the better of you. You may feel that you don’t have the smarts, the right contacts, or the guts to pull it off. But take heart–this is a temporary event caused by the emotional Moon opposing Saturn. All you need is a fresh perspective to put things in the right frame, and that will come over the weekend.

"
6281,26 august 2016,aries,"Wake up and smell the coffee! A reality check comes your way from the general direction of Mars and Neptune. They’re in a cosmic smackdown today, so take a look at expectations in all areas of your life. Are you kidding yourself about anything? Not sticking to good habits or routines, yet expecting change? Be brutally honest.

"
6282,27 august 2016,aries,"The two most helpful planets in our solar system team up today: Venus and Jupiter. They meet in your house of fitness and vitality. What a wonderful aspect for kicking off a diet and exercise regimen, or to finally get rid of aches and pains that have been bothering you! This also happens to be your sector of efficiency and getting things done, so don’t be surprised if you become highly motivated to ditch the clutter and go feng shui.

"
6283,28 august 2016,aries,"Now that the Moon is transiting one of the most emotional parts of your chart, you might be feeling a bit moody, possible even nostalgic for days gone by. But a positive aspect between Chiron, the wounded healer, and La Luna bodes well for getting past this. Meditation, a walk in  nature, a soothing cup of tea and a good book–do whatever you need to slow down and relax.

"
6284,29 august 2016,aries,"Thinking about going on a diet or kickstarting an exercise program? Make your decision today as glam Venus is getting ready to leave your house of vitality and fitness. Mercury retrogrades in this sector tomorrow, so you may want to review why previous regimens didn’t work. It’s also wise to rid yourself of chronic aches and pains over the next three weeks.

"
6285,30 august 2016,aries,"Collaboration with another talented person could be the key to success, whether it’s in your career, a volunteer organization, or a neighborhood group. Venus’ entry into the partnership house bodes well for working with others. Mercury starts to spin backward, but this gives you the opportunity to go back and polish up past work projects. It’s all about streamlining your life right now, from household chores to office work flow.

"
6286,31 august 2016,aries,"A sudden burst of initiative may catch you by surprise as you decide to get your act together. Take a look at the areas of your life where things are not organized or create confusion, whether it’s a routine, a certain person or a bad habit. Then resolve to take action. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse will light a fire under you to see things through to a successful conclusion.

"
6287,1 september 2016,aries,"Revamp your resume! A juicy solar eclipse in your work zone could bring you a sudden offer of employment you weren’t expecting. Your current employer might have an opening for you that holds more responsibility, so make a short list of your talents and achievements. This is also a great time to get back on the fitness bandwagon and shed those excess summertime burger-and-beer pounds.

"
6288,2 september 2016,aries,"You can make amazing headway today on a work project, maybe even dazzling others with your ideas and productivity. But hold off a bit before going public with it, as it seems that more planning is in order. Watch out for detractors too as murky Neptune gives the stinkeye to your success. It may be wise to wait until the 7th for any big announcements or presentations.

"
6289,3 september 2016,aries,"As the emotional Moon makes tight angles to both happy Jupiter and romantic Venus, this is a wonderful day for matters of the heart. It’s perfect for figuring out how you can spend more time with the people you love, so get practical about the daily grind and see how you can carve out more time for the things that matter.

"
6290,4 september 2016,aries,"With the luckiest planet in our solar system entering your relationship house later this week, both romantic and business alliances are about to take on a new level of commitment. Give some consideration today as to what you’d like to experience in both, and that includes you singles. In particular, the Moon will have you questioning the balance of power. Have you been too quick to give your power away to a partner? Or are you too domineering? It’s time to find balance.

"
6291,5 september 2016,aries,"Sharing is caring. Or is it? A Moon-Uranus opposition today will find you questioning just how much information you want to share with others. You may decide to keep your opinions and feelings to yourself, at least until Wednesday, when the atmosphere changes and you can relax about being candid.

"
6292,6 september 2016,aries,"The path ahead is going to become more clear over the next few days, Aries. A wonderful trine between the illuminating Sun and life-changing Pluto will help you set priorities and develop a plan to attain your goals. With the Moon in one of the vibiest parts of your chart today, you may add “serenity” and “down time” to your bucket list.

"
6293,7 september 2016,aries,"Great day to focus on the future with four benevolent planes smiling at each other across the heavens. Career progress is possible with a strong Sun-Pluto trine, and you may even be considering transferring into a completely new field. Lovers can set things in motion that will have far-reaching consequences in the years ahead. Singles-you’re not left out! Is a work-related romance in the cards?

"
6294,8 september 2016,aries,"Who wants to live their life hiding in a corner? Not you, Aries! With the passionate Moon swinging past energetic Mars and stable Saturn in the most adventurous part of your chart, your motivation to live La Vida Loca will increase. But Neptune may be stirring up doubts as it’s active in the part of your chart that governs the subconscious mind. Let your concerns fly out the window and focus on coloring outside the lines.

"
6295,9 september 2016,aries,"The love train’s a’comin’ to town, Aries! Generous Jupiter powers its way into your seventh house of commitment, a place it hasn’t visited in over a decade. Many of you will find a keeper, get engaged, decide to move in together, or cement an already existing bond. And the best way to further your career (and income) over the years head may well be to enter into some form or business alliance. Two heads are definitely better than one under this aspect, as Jupiter governs profits.

"
6296,10 september 2016,aries,"Got an opinion? You may want to keep it to yourself today, as you might rub someone the wrong way-even if you’re 100% right! A difficult Saturn-Neptune square could create an adversary in your midst, so stay on your toes. Likewise, think twice before revealing big plans or ideas to others unless you trust them implicitly. Neptune is the planet of deception, so keep your cards close to your vest.

"
6297,11 september 2016,aries,"What it is that you truly want out of love is the focus of today’s planetary energy. Regardless as to whether you’re committed or single, a Venus-Pluto square finds you questioning the path ahead. However, this doesn’t spell trouble. It just means that you need to develop a clear focus, and if you have a partner, you need to be on the same page.

"
6298,12 september 2016,aries,"Look before you leap! Impulsive Venus may spur you to desire something: a person, a big purchase, or even a particular course of action. But Pluto is in a tough spot, warning you to take things slow. You need to wrap up things you’ve already started before moving on to the next phase.

"
6299,13 september 2016,aries,"What needs to stay, and what has to go? With a lunar eclipse coming this Friday in your house of closure, start making an inventory. A terse Mars-Sun aspect today may find you chomping at the bit, anxious to make changes, but El Sol advises that you take it slow and pay attention to procedure and details. Rome wasn’t built in a day.

"
6300,14 september 2016,aries,"A sudden burst of motivation could hit you as the Moon makes terrific aspects to spontaneous Uranus and energetic Mars. When the Moon enters Pisces later in the week, your imagination will soar. Use this inspirational vibe to imagine what you’d like to experience—then manifest it.

"
6301,15 september 2016,aries,"You’re a walking radio tower today as the vibey Moon meets up with even vibier Neptune. Good thing, too, as tomorrow’s eclipse will illuminate the most hidden parts of your subconscious mind. Pay close attention to your dreams and any gut hunches you receive. They will be on point, providing you with information that you need to make key decisions.

"
6302,16 september 2016,aries,"Out with the old, in with the new! It’s like New Year’s Eve all over again today as a lunar eclipse takes place in your house of closure. People and situations that are no longer working for you need to be evaluated and perhaps removed from your life. While this can mean making decisions that are difficult, it’s necessary. Mars is in a bit of a tight spot, warning you to not go too fast or too far with changes. That’s the beauty of an eclipse: it sets up a six-month period in which you can initiate bold new plans.

"
6303,17 september 2016,aries,"Yesterday’s eclipse was designed to bust you out of old, worn-out routines and situations, and the action can start today! A bold and energetic trine between Mars and Uranus could be the impetus you need to kick off new initiatives. Mars is in your house of ideas and opinions, so be loud and proud. What if the people around you aren’t ready for this new you? Too bad! You can’t stop a roaring freight train.

"
6304,18 september 2016,aries,"A sudden burst of adrenaline could hit as the passionate Moon connects with energetic and spontaneous Uranus. Charging forward and tackling projects, whether it’s just cleaning out the garage or planning world domination, will be on your mind. A romantic or business partner, however, may not share your zest for getting things done. Roll with it because this could change by tomorrow.

"
6305,19 september 2016,aries,"You’re in the mood for love with a yummy Venus-Mars meetup, but you won’t be settling for just a person with a pulse. The Moon in grounded Taurus signals amorous Neptune, ramping up your desire for a relationship with only the deepest kind of romance and intimacy.

"
6306,20 september 2016,aries,"This will be a week in which you can make big progress with your goals and ambitions. Today and Friday Mercury trines Pluto, giving you plenty of opportunities to strategize. With intelligent Mercury in your house of creating streamlined routines, you’re in a good position to come up with innovative ways to move forward.

"
6307,22 september 2016,aries,"Once lucky Jupiter entered your seventh house of commitment back on the 9th, it opened up a thirteen-month window in which you can meet the love of your life, not to mention taking an existing relationship to a higher level. Well, now it gets even better. The Sun has just joined Jupiter in Libra, making the next four weeks even more  auspicious for romance.

"
6308,23 september 2016,aries,"Don’t be too quick to put your all of your eggs in one basket, specifically in the hands of one person. A Moon-Jupiter square urges you to look out for #1, at least for the next few days. It’s not selfish to ensure that your own needs are being met in a relationship, whether it’s personal or business.

"
6309,24 september 2016,aries,"Sometimes you just have to buckle down and handle the grunt work, and that’s what the cosmos is telling you today. Perhaps you need to get caught up with the pile of papers on your desk at home or the office. Maybe you need to balance the checkbook or empty out the garage. Start tackling things now so that you end up feeling in control of your life, instead of being overwhelmed.

"
6310,25 september 2016,aries,"Got your eye on a hot romantic prospect? Or maybe you’re single without anyone in your crosshairs, stranded in the desert of love. Involved with someone terrific? Or perhaps you’re ready to move on. Aries, regardless of your status, today’s fabulous for making progress in the love department. The frisky Leo Moon winks at the Sun and Jupiter in the commitment zone. Make things happen.

"
6311,26 september 2016,aries,"Amazing day for partnering up with someone courtesy of the annual Sun-Jupiter conjunction! In business, you could join forces with someone whose input could help you think more creatively. In love, it’s time to find a keeper or to advance an already serious relationship. Considering that the Moon in passionate Leo forms a terrific angle with long-term Saturn, whatever transpires has longevity–and fun!–written all over it.

"
6312,27 september 2016,aries,"Your ambitions get a huge boost as assertive Mars barrels into your tenth house of achievement and success for the first time in two years. Pluto just went direct in this sector yesterday, helping you step into a more confident and powerful place. But you may decide in the weeks ahead to go it alone rather than to team up with someone else. If you do want to travel down a path with someone, be discerning–make sure they’re worth it.

"
6313,29 september 2016,aries,"Inspiration to get fit and healthy may strike out of the blue today, which is always a good thing. The Moon makes a helpful aspect to spontaneous Uranus, indicating that even if you’re already on a diet or exercise regimen that it may need to be tweaked. Keep your mind open to new options.

"
6314,30 september 2016,aries,"A romantic weekend for all signs lies ahead with the two most amorous planets, Venus and Neptune, forming a perfect angle for love. But your sign especially benefits today from a sweet meeting of the Moon and lucky Jupiter in your commitment sector. Singles, keep your eyes peeled. Attached rams should plan a lovely date night. Just make sure, however, that you’re not wearing rose-colored glasses when it comes to love.

"
6315,1 october 2016,aries,"A new chapter can open up in a romantic relationship, thanks to today’s new moon in your partnership sector. The same holds true for business alliances, so if you’ve been considering retaining an expert to represent your interests (such as a booking agent or an accountant), or entering into a standard partnership, now’s the time. A hush-hush trine between Venus and Jupiter suggests that you keep plans quiet, at least for now: your engagement, pregnancy, or business deal.

"
6316,2 october 2016,aries,"La Luna enters Scorpio today, focusing your mind on earthly desires: sex, intimacy, and financial abundance, to name a few goodies. With yesterday’s new moon in your commitment sector, no doubt you’ll be thinking not just about having a partner but one who can add a lot of spice to your life! Teaming up with a savvy business expert is also in the stars, someone who can add to your bottom line.

"
6317,3 october 2016,aries,"With the two most domineering planets in the solar system, Pluto and Mars, both in your house of authority and ambition, you are a force to be reckoned with these days. But strong-arming people into doing things your way is not the best MO, nor is trying to do everything on your own. The best strategy right now is to work with others, giving them a voice as well as some responsibilities.

"
6318,4 october 2016,aries,"Potent day in the cosmos with the Sun and Saturn forming a sextile, a positive aspect. Saturn is the planet of thinking long term and happens to be in the house of thinking big, so this makes for an interesting placement. Partnerships of all kinds are the focus, whether they’re business or romantic. Some Aries will get engaged today, decide to move in together, find the right one, or take a relationship to a higher level. Others will hold conversations with potential business partners or experts, such as booking agents or accountants, to help further their careers.

"
6319,5 october 2016,aries,"Duty calls as errands, family responsibilities and the daily grind at the office don’t seem to diminish. But a cheerful Moon-Jupiter connection reminds you that there’s more to life than just mucking through your days. If you don’t start taking more downtime for yourself and your loved ones, the stress will mount–and so will your discontent. Schedule in some free time.

"
6320,6 october 2016,aries,"Partnership progress can get stymied today as Mars squares Jupiter. Both of these are go-go-go planets, and they’re trying to achieve progress when it comes to romance and business alliances. But today they’re stuck in the mud. One of you may be ready to move forward and the other is not. This drama will continue into next week, so patience will be a virtue.

"
6321,7 october 2016,aries,"Chatty Mercury enters your house of serious partnerships, which certainly is helpful! Other planets in that house are forming tense angles to others, creating friction with bosses, decision makers and business connections. In addition, your relationship with a loved one could be a bit strained right now. Mercury’s appearance is a blessing as it will help you communicate your needs, ideas and feelings to others. Don’t use your words to strong arm people, however, a possibility under current aspects.

"
6322,8 october 2016,aries,"Inspiration can strike at any moment as the Moon in your ambitious tenth house sextiles Neptune. Right now is the best time in over two years to pursue big goals, thanks to Mars and Pluto in your success zone. The Moon joins them over the weekend, making this an auspicious time to plan. Neptune is known as the muse of artists and scientists but all Aries can work with this positive energy to achieve results.

"
6323,9 october 2016,aries,"Someone’s feeling feisty! The Moon’s passage past Mars and Pluto this weekend is encouraging you to take control of your life, relationships and circumstances. But resistance on your part may crop up, whether it’s based on fear, procrastination or being too worried about what other people think. Next week’s full moon in Aries will demand that you step into your power.

Singles, you could meet someone with long term potential in the weeks ahead. All Aries benefit from next week’s full moon in your sign, which puts your desires in the spotlight.

"
6326,12 october 2016,aries,"Do you want the same things as others who are in your intimate circle? It’s important to communicate with a lover or business partner right now. Just watch the tendency to become dictatorial, a possibility with aggressive Mars in your house of authority. The full moon on the 16th is in your sign, so no doubt you’re looking out for #1. Which is OK as long as you can share common ground with someone close.

"
6327,13 october 2016,aries,"Hell, yeah! You’ve got ambition—loads of it—thanks to megawatt Mats and power broker Pluto in your house of goals and success. But not everyone around you is as fired up as you are, something to keep in mind. You run the risk of annoying a romantic partner or business alliance with your let’s-get-moving attitude. Just focus on blazing your own path without expecting others to go along for the ride.

"
6328,14 october 2016,aries,"You’re craving stability when it comes to life’s biggest issues, and serious Saturn wants to deliver it. This is an excellent day for talking things over with someone who can help make things happen. With erratic Uranus active in Aries, chances are you’re feeling restless, maybe even anxious. Don’t let anxiety get in the way of making smart long term decisions.

6329,15 october 2016,aries,"My way or the highway? You could be feeling mighty feisty as a number of planets are placing the emphasis on your needs. You might even be surprised at how determined you suddenly are to protect your interests. With tomorrow’s full moon in your sign, things are going to reach critical mass.

"
6330,16 october 2016,aries,"What about me? That may be the question on your lips as a full moon in Aries stirs up your own wishes. Lately the planets have been testing you, with people in your circle placing demands on your time and attention. Now it’s time to focus on what you want. With erratic Uranus near the Moon, even you might be surprised at how strongly you react to situations that have been going on for far too long. This isn’t about getting angry, but instead about making changes. Your attention may fall first on close relationships, such as romantic or business alliances, as the Sun opposes Uranus. Does this mean Splitsville? Maybe. But it could also herald a new chapter in which you start putting your own needs at the same level as others’.

"
6331,17 october 2016,aries,"Oh, yeah. A smokin’ hot trine between the Moon and Pluto can work wonders when it comes to transforming your career prospects. Actually, any major goal of yours can get a facelift today as Pluto urges you to rethink what it is you’d like to accomplish. Some ambitions may be tossed entirely to be replaced by better ones; others may just need a minor tweak. When Venus enters Sagittarius tomorrow it’s nothing but green lights ahead.

"
6332,18 october 2016,aries,"Sometimes taking a risk can feel uncomfortable or even downright scary. But now that Venus is in your house of living outside the box, it should be much easier to put yourself out there on a limb. Dating, job hunting, applying to school, starting a business, trying a new sport or hobby, traveling to an exotic destination–dare to dream and to then go for it.

"
6333,19 october 2016,aries,"This is one of the most powerful days of the year to discuss future plans with someone: where a romance is heading, your career, or a business venture. A rare meeting between Mars and Pluto in your dynamic tenth house of authority helps put you in the driver’s seat. Not only that, influential people may go out of their way in the days ahead to help you: putting in a good word, acting as a mentor, or introducing you to a more forward thinking group of folks. But you have to let them know that you’re interested, so don’t be shy!

"
6334,20 october 2016,aries,"Did any issues come up with someone close at the full moon this past Sunday? If so, they may be back for discussion again, and truth be told things could get tense. With erratic Uranus acting up in your house of self-esteem and goals, you may feel confined by what you perceive to be limitations from others. To top it off Venus is encouraging you to be independent and go after passion projects that mean a lot to you. Try to work things out, but don’t forget to take care of yourself while you’re at it.

"
6335,21 october 2016,aries,"Insecurity about your job or business could arise with a Moon-Mars-Pluto opposition. The bottom line is that Mars and Pluto are hell bent on seeing to it that you achieve higher levels of success. So why the fear and worry? It could be that you’re considering entering a new industry, changing jobs or switching up your income earning strategies. That’s nothing to fear, though—it’s to be commended.

"
6336,22 october 2016,aries,"Woo-hoo! The Sun enters Scorpio, your sexy eighth house of libido and intimacy. Over the next four weeks you can get a lot closer to another person, not only physically but emotionally. Singles, a new hottie may be close at hand—just make sure that if you want more than a quick canoodle, find out what makes this person tick. This is also a great month for analyzing your finances, paying down debt and finding a second source of income. Entrepreneurs, you may discover that others want to be a part of your venture by forming a partnership or simply providing venture capital.

"
6337,23 october 2016,aries,"The planets are suggesting that Aries lovers get to know their partner better through quality time discussions. Today’s a good day to get started with a Jupiter-Neptune aspect, and things will get even better in the weeks ahead. That’s because candid Mercury enters your house of bonding and intimacy tomorrow for a three-week stay. If you have something special you want to discuss with a lover, this Thursday is stellar. Mark your calendar.

"
6338,24 october 2016,aries,"Ggrrrrr, tiger! Mercury sashays into your house of libido and intimacy for a three-week stay. It’s not only a heavenly time for boudoir activities but it’s also excellent for holding deep conversations with the one you love. Singles, you’ll be more charismatic than ever, so strut your stuff! A new moon in this part of the sky on the 30th helps inaugurate fresh changes.

"
6339,25 october 2016,aries,"Snap out of it! A tense angle between the two planets of love, Venus and Neptune, indicates that you need to get real about romance. Operating on pure emotion isn’t going to fly. If you’ve been fantasizing about a person or relationship, start being rational. If you’ve been using guilt or passive-aggressive tactics to get your way, try to a more direct approach. That’s the best way to clear up your mind and make progress.

"
6340,26 october 2016,aries,"Ready to take a chance in love? Or maybe you’re already involved and want to put some more spice into your romance. Then go for it! A sparkling aspect between love planet Venus and optimistic Jupiter urges you to open up your heart and plan more quality time.

6341,27 october 2016,aries,"Great day for sext. A yummy Sun-Mercury meet up is perfect for flirting, winking, sexting and whispering words of admiration, love or lust! These two celestial orbs are in your house of intimacy and bonding. What a perfect time to let someone know how you feel! Singles, you’re not left out of this discussion. Make it your business to ooze charisma over the next few days.

"
6342,28 october 2016,aries,"You may be open to a romantic adventure under today’s planetary aspects. Take a chance on a different kind of lover, someone who’s not the usual type. Book a trip to someplace exotic, a place that the two of you haven’t visited before. Singles could meet a new love while in transit. Abundant Jupiter tells you to take a risk, as it will open your heart.

"
6343,29 october 2016,aries,"If you’ve been sticking to the same old routine, doing things the usual way without considering fresher options, the cosmos may give you a kick in the pants today. But this is a positive event as it will help you get out of an unproductive rut. Instead, your eyes will be opened to new habits and methods that will prove to be a lot more courageous and adventuresome, without being risky. Live a little!

"
6344,30 october 2016,aries,"A sparkling new moon sets the stage for more romance and intimacy in the months ahead! It falls in your house of deep emotional and physical bonding, so don’t be surprised if your desire for sex and soulful talks increases dramatically. Vibey Neptune is in a terrific angle from your hush-hush sector indicating that you may be in the mood for more private time alone with an amour. Likewise, you could be harboring a crush on someone–or an admirer could be crushing on you.

"
6345,31 october 2016,aries,"Someone may be determined this week to show you who’s the boss. Whether they really are or not is another story! Keep a cool head about you, as erratic Uranus may prompt you to lash out against their nonsense. This is a classic Emperor’s New Clothes  kind of situation. Let them make a fool of themselves while you smile serenely.

"
6346,1 november 2016,aries,"Peace at last? A helpful Sun-Neptune trine helps you get to the bottom of emotional issues that have been weighing you down. Whether they’re unpleasant childhood memories, mistrust and grudges from an old romantic relationship or bad habits, you can make enormous headway today. Identifying what’s troubling you is the first step and the Sun will illuminate the way.

"
6347,2 november 2016,aries,"Take a risk or hold back? That’s the big question as the emotional Moon swings through your house of experimentation. Yes, you want serenity and comfort, but another voice in your head urges you to take some chances. From your planetary outlook it appears that you’ll opt for being a little adventurous. Things will become more clear by Saturday.

"
6348,3 november 2016,aries,"People in positions of power may be considering you for a particular job or assignment, and it’s in your best interest to show them that you have the chops to handle it. That shouldn’t be a problem with eloquent, fast thinking Mercury in your house of financial strength. Whatever you initiate now could pay off handsomely in the future. Keep at it and plan major presentations for Monday.

"
6349,4 november 2016,aries,"People in positions of authority may be difficult to read. They could also be downright difficult. But keep your tongue—and your emotions—in check, as an outburst or argument won’t help matters. Wait until Monday when a positive Sun-Pluto aspect makes it far easier to communicate.

"
6350,5 november 2016,aries,"Life is beautiful! Well, it should be anyway, especially for your sign. That’s because Uranus forms a glorious aspect with lovely Venus in the most optimistic and adventurous part of your chart. Don’t be surprised if you experience an “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore” moment. Spontaneous Uranus could induce you (very quickly I might add) to get out of a rut and start living life your way. if your life isn’t beautiful, then it’s up to you to change things.

"
6351,6 november 2016,aries,"Spontaneity can work for you or against you, and with erratic Uranus stirring up the pot, you need to make wise decisions. With Mars getting ready to move into the house of long-held dreams on Wednesday you may already be chomping at the bit. Slow down there, ram, and give things time to develop and manifest.

"
6352,7 november 2016,aries,"Should you go things alone or be a member of a team? Conflicting planetary aspects urge you to showcase your personal talents to decision makers yet play nice with others. Once Mars enters Aquarius on Wednesday you could be drawn into group projects, but things could get competitive. Be a trooper yet still look out for #1.

"
6353,8 november 2016,aries,"The Moon in the friendliest part of your chart encourages you to reach out to friends, neighbors and business contacts. Over the next five weeks they will play an important role in your life, introducing you to new pals, helping you gain access to clubs or networks you’d like to join, and maybe even assist you in finding a new job—or lover. Don’t be shy! Spontaneous Uranus in your sign will give you the jolt of energy you need to start making those calls. Once you get going, the momentum will build.

"
6354,9 november 2016,aries,"You’ve been working hard lately and the planets are getting ready to give you a much-needed break. Now that gregarious Mars is in your friendship sector, let your hair down and do some socializing. That shouldn’t be too hard, what with all of the holiday get togethers on the way. But you could meet new people who could put you in touch with decision makers, or those who could be mentors to you. Pals could play matchmaker over the next five weeks as well, all the more reason to get out of the house!

"
6355,10 november 2016,aries,"Your intuition is the best source of wisdom today so don’t ignore it. Your sixth sense could be right on target, especially when it comes to matters involving love and money. Start taking control of your future in these areas, demanding security as well as a clear plan for the future. Next week’s full moon will put an end to shaky finances and the words “It’s complicated” when it comes to romance.

"
6356,11 november 2016,aries,"Who needs to wait till New Year’s Eve to start coming up with their 2017 resolutions? Not you, Aries! With magnetic Venus now in the most ambitious part of your chart, spend the next three weeks pondering which passion projects to go after. It’s also a great time to hold serious conversations with a lover about your goals for the long term.

"
6357,12 november 2016,aries,"Be selective! Now that Mercury is in your optimistic house of taking chances, you may be ready to jump head first into quite a few new opportunities. But you run the risk of taking on too much too soon. Choose the best of the bunch and save the others for early 2017.

"
6358,13 november 2016,aries,"With tomorrow’s full moon in your earnings sector, you may be seeing nothing but dollar signs around you. And with profitable Venus now in your ambition sector, you should be able to track down more sources of income. But slow and steady is the way to go. Don’t let impatience overrule common sense.

"
6359,14 november 2016,aries,"Best time all year to score a raise, new job or close a client! A super full moon in Taurus, your income sector, helps make the cash register ring. A Neptune-North Node aspect tells you that it’s not your karma to be broke or struggling with finances! You deserve success, and with Mars in a super angle to the Moon, right now its the people you know (more so than what you know) who can help you move forward.

"
6360,15 november 2016,aries,"The battle between security and independence rages on today, as four celestial orbs are at odds with each other in the heavens. A Moon-Neptune aspect may be making you feel confused or concerned about heading down a particular path, while Mercury and Mars are urging you to go for it! One of the problems may be deciding whose opinion or character you can trust. When Neptune goes direct this weekend clarity will return.

"
6361,16 november 2016,aries,"It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it that counts. Reconsider how you connect with the people closest to you, as you may have been too blunt lately for your own good. This holds true for face to face conversations as well as texts, tweets and other modes of communication. You may be too quick to say what’s on your mind when you really should be holding back a little bit. Give others the opportunity to voice their opinions and be diplomatic in your response.

"
6362,17 november 2016,aries,"Some of the people around you may be difficult to read, and your mind might start dreaming up dramas and scenarios that may or may not be accurate. You still have a way to go on your personal journey when it comes to relating to others, which includes not being a doormat. The key is discernment: the ability to separate when you’re actually being mistreated, and when you’re not. A lot of this comes down to your sense of personal security.

"
6363,18 november 2016,aries,"Trust issues? Don’t be surprised if you’re unsure as to whom you can rely on. With Mercury in the most optimistic part of your chart chances are that you’d like to believe that everyone is on your side. But a Neptune-Mercury square today warns that someone in your environment may be working at cross purposes to you, perhaps even trying to stall a big plan of yours. That’s OK. When the Sun enters Sagittarius next week, you’ll be unstoppable.

"
6364,19 november 2016,aries,"Get ready to make progress! Neptune goes direct, helping you release worn out feelings of low self-esteem. Fears, worries and dramas should recede into the background as you start to feel more empowered. Better yet is that Venus, situated in your house of ambition and success, forms a positive aspect with Neptune, indicating that a career matter can be worked out. So update your resume, get a brag book of your accomplishments going, and prepare to toot your own horn. December will be an awesome month for making progress on all of your goals.

"
6365,20 november 2016,aries,"Inspiration could strike today, so take any ideas that pop into your head seriously. As the Moon is in your house of fun and creativity, you might be inspired to take the kids to the science museum, sign up for a cooking class or take a chance in love. With the Sun entering the most adventurous part of your chart tomorrow, the words “I’m bored” should not be a part of your vocabulary.

"
6366,21 november 2016,aries,"It’s all systems “go” as the mighty Sun rolls into Sagittarius, your enterprising house of personal growth and optimism. You can go after any passion or goal that’s close to your heart, the bigger, the better! That’s because assertive Mars is in your house of long-held dreams. There will be nothing stopping you, Aries.

"
6367,22 november 2016,aries,"Talks between you and someone close can take on an optimistic new tone. You’re in more of an open-minded state, and if you can be flexible when it comes to sharing responsibilities (and opinions), progress can be made. With powerful Pluto in your house of authority, you may have  often felt that you’ve had to beat people over the head in order to be heard. But in the four weeks ahead, subtlety will get you much further.

"
6368,23 november 2016,aries,"It’s time to make a clean break from the past. This doesn’t mean leaving your job, lover or home. But it does mean leaving a life of boredom, playing it safe or not going after the items on your bucket list. You’re not supposed to be buried in a casket with that bucket! The idea is to check those items off the list while your heart is still beating. It is, which means that it’s time to get moving.

"
6369,24 november 2016,aries,"You can only do so much to please others, something that may become apparent today. Someone in your circle may try to act like the boss despite your open and diplomatic approach. While this isn’t worth ruining your day over, you may realize over the weekend that you need to take more of an authoritative approach with the people around you. Otherwise you’ll continue to get run over.

"
6370,25 november 2016,aries,"You’re known as the go-getter sign of the zodiac and current cosmic activity indicates green lights ahead. Over the next week you can initiate changes that will carry forward for decades to come. If you need training, education or the help of a mentor, seek it out. No man or woman is an island.
 

"
6371,26 november 2016,aries,"Sometimes you just need to switch up your perspective in order to see what’s really going on around you. It’s so easy to get caught up in the same old way of viewing life, but this can hamper your personal growth. Today a spectacular Uranus-Mercury trine endows you with out-of-the-box thinking. Pay attention, because Tuesday’s new moon will allow you to take these ideas and run with them.

"
6372,27 november 2016,aries,"You need a time out from working and thinking all the time, and today the cosmos urges you to do just that. Mentally step away from your career and other goals and just chill. You’re too close to the issues at hand to see them clearly. This week inspiration will flow, helping you view things in a different light.

"
6373,28 november 2016,aries,"Of all the signs of the zodiac, you’re the most motivated to bust out of a rut and doing things the same old way, Aries. As Albert Einstein said, “Insanity is doing the same things over and over again and expecting a different result.” With so many planets in your houses of independence, expansion and your deepest held wishes, there’s no place to go but up.

"
6374,29 november 2016,aries,"You may be trying out which direction to head in, considering today’s new moon in the most adventurous part of your chart. But before you decide to head down a particular path, you need to ask yourself a few honest questions. Are you willing to take ownership of a project or the results you achieve? Are you ready to ask for help, perhaps partnering with someone? With Uranus acting up in your sign, you may feel like being a lone wolf, but Jupiter advises aligning yourself with others who have similar aims. Strike a balance between being independent and a team player.

"
6375,30 november 2016,aries,"Yesterday’s new moon was all about starting new initiatives in all areas of your life, but today you may be confused about where and how to begin. The problem doesn’t seem to be a lack of bright ideas, but doubts and fears that you can pull them off. The smartest thing you can do right now is to seek help in areas where you feel unsure. Sign up for a class, find a mentor, listen to pod casts, read a how-to book. The internet is loaded with free resources; take advantage of them.

"
6376,1 december 2016,aries,"Networking is the name of the game in the weeks ahead. A powerful, positive aspect today encourages you to get out and meet as many people as possible. Go through your contact list and reach out to folks who will put in good words for you, introduce you to a future spouse or will stimulate your brain. When love planet Venus enters this part of the sky on the 7th, friends can be your ticket to finding new love—which includes a platonic pal who’d like to be more!

"
6377,2 december 2016,aries,"If you’re looking for a new job, positioning yourself for a raise or working on new services to add to your business, now’s the time to get cracking. Intelligent Mercury, the shrewd planet of negotiation, moves into your career house today for several weeks. Problem is, it’s scheduled to go retrograde on the 19th and you know what that means. Besides, with the holidays coming right after that it will be hard to find decision makers anyway. Make your mark now.

"
6378,3 december 2016,aries,"Chances are that you’re thinking about life with a much more elevated view thanks to Mars helping you see the big picture. Sometimes we get so caught up in the petty details of our days that we’re blinded to other, more exciting possibilities. Today Mars links up with Saturn in yet another part of your chart that is expansive, so all systems are go! The decisions that you make in the near future can carry forward for decades, so choose wisely.

"
6379,4 december 2016,aries,"Friends or acquaintances can be extraordinarily lucky for you in the weeks ahead. With a happy Moon-Mars connection today, reach out to pals and make plans. Better yet, put yourself in places where you could meet new faces: your church, a mommy meet up group, singles mixers, seminars, trade shows. Your contacts could be the key to opening new doors in love, business and just plain fun.

"
6380,5 december 2016,aries,"Cue Frank Sinatra, circa 1969: “I did it my way!”  Yup, that old standard applies to you, Aries, as the planets are encouraging you to break from the (rat) pack and do your own thing. This doesn’t mean that you should ignore the advice or wisdom of others. On the contrary, you could learn a lot from friends and mentors. But your path in this lifetime is yours alone to travel.

"
6381,6 december 2016,aries,"Go with the flow, as planetary influences tell you that you’ll need to work with a team rather than against them. You may be surprised to discover that you actually enjoy it! That’s because Mars is in your house of camaraderie, encouraging you to consider the ideas and the company of other people. When Venus enters this part of the sky tomorrow, getting along with people, no matter how difficult they may have been in the past, should get easier.

"
6382,7 december 2016,aries,"Get ready to rub elbows and schmooze. Now that Venus is in your house of camaraderie, the people you know (and those whom you haven’t met yet!) can become an even more important part of your life. If you’re working on any kind of group project or volunteer effort, you may be wrapping it up around the time of the full moon on Tuesday. The next week is excellent for networking with people, whether you’re looking for love, a new job or just for fun.

"
6383,8 december 2016,aries,"You may be anxious to take on a leadership role at work or in some kind of group activity, which is a good thing. But before you go much further you should pick the brain of someone who has already traveled down this path. You’re not suffering from a lack of bright ideas with the Sun and Saturn in your house of innovation. But why reinvent the wheel? If someone can offer you wisdom, take it.

"
6384,9 december 2016,aries,"A powerful Sun-Saturn meet up on Saturday can help you initiate a big idea that has been rolling around in your mind. But first you need to nail down some of the specifics, and your best bet today is to reach out to someone who can provide you with advice. You may want to team up on this venture with someone else as two heads are better than one. Consider collaborations that will take an idea from the planning stages to reality.

"
6385,10 december 2016,aries,"Your head may be in the clouds, but the good news is that your feet are firmly planted on the ground! Today is excellent for taking big dreams from the planning stage to the off-and-running stage. With serious Saturn by your side, you’ll be thinking logically and will have the discipline to see things through. If you need the advice of a mentor or someone who has traveled this path before, seek it. Gaining knowledge is the golden key.

"
6386,11 december 2016,aries,"Your ideas about what you need in your closest personal relationships may be changing, Aries. While you crave security, you’re not willing to be a doormat or play second fiddle. There’s a strong independent streak developing, thanks to maverick Uranus spurring you to look after your own needs and desires. But you don’t have to give up the comfort and companionship of the people around you while you take care of your own personal business.

"
6387,12 december 2016,aries,"It may be time to strike off on a new path you haven’t traveled before, Aries. Don’t be surprised if a restlessness seems to take over. You’re becoming aware that there are more options to life than you may have realized, and some of them look mighty tempting. Tomorrow’s full moon will help you crystallize some of these ideas and let you run with them. Will everyone around you be happy? Maybe, maybe not. But life’s too short to play it safe.

"
6388,13 december 2016,aries,"Got a big idea? Don’t keep it stuck in the recesses of your mind. Today’s full moon in the sector that governs thinking and expression encourages you to go from the ruminating stage to the planning and action stage. It’s also a smart move to brainstorm with other people right now as two heads are better than one (the lunation is in Gemini,  duh!). With Saturn in an excellent position to the Sun, your plans can really go a long distance—as in a worldwide stage. As long as you don’t expect overnight success and you’re willing to put in hard work, let your thoughts take flight.

"
6389,14 december 2016,aries,"Open up the lines of communication with the people in your circle if you want to make progress. With lucky Jupiter in your house of partnering up, you can make faster progress by sharing ideas and responsibilities with others. However, a tough Uranus-Jupiter aspect might make you rebel against sharing and cooperating. Are you involved with the right kind of people? When Uranus goes direct on the 29th, confusion about your friends, lover and business contacts should clear up.

"
6390,15 december 2016,aries,"Getting bossed around? Four planets squaring off against each other in the heavens create a push-pull in which you may feel like Cinderella. This could be at home, at the office or within a romantic relationship. If that’s the case, you’ll have the opportunity to reflect upon the role you play in these circumstances once Mercury retrogrades next Monday. But you won’t be huddled in a corner, licking your wounds! Hell no. When the Sun enters Capricorn next Wednesday, you’ll be stepping into a place of personal power.

"
6391,17 december 2016,aries,"Life is too short to be working all the time and the cosmos suggests that you have some fun this weekend! With the Moon entering Leo, your house of creativity, why don’t you set aside some time to pursue hobbies that may have fallen by the wayside? With structured Saturn in a helpful angle, you might even make this a regular habit. You may also realize that you need  to be involved in an activity that fills you up and puts a smile on your face.

"
6392,18 december 2016,aries,"How to keep everyone happy? Your busy schedule may have you at wit’s end as you don’t have enough hours in the day for friends and loved ones, let alone yourself. With the Moon in fun-loving Leo you’re aching to have a good time and relax. Don’t worry–once Mars enters Pisces tomorrow, you’ll find more time to slow down and recharge your batteries.

"
6393,19 december 2016,aries,"Keep a lid on it! Mars enters the most confidential part of your chart just as Mercury retrogrades in your house of ambition. The message? Plan big, say little. Conduct research behind closed doors. Not everyone needs to know what you have planned next.

"
6394,20 december 2016,aries,"Despite the holiday madness the cosmos is telling you to slow down and go within. Now that Mars is in the part of your chart that governs the subconscious mind, reflect upon the circumstances and people that throw you off balance. Then make the determination to deal with them somehow. Whether that means excising them from you life (or should I say “exorcising”?!), reframing the problem, speaking with a therapist or learning how to become more mindful, you’ll be working with the positive energy on hand.

"
6395,21 december 2016,aries,"The Sun’s move into the most ambitious part of your chart sets the stage for some early resolution planning. The key is to examine where and how previous plans and goals fell apart or got side tracked. With Mercury retrograde in this part of your chart, the smart ram acknowledges past mistakes and delusions, then wraps up unfinished business. Once you’ve done that you can move forward with confidence and momentum.

"
6396,22 december 2016,aries,"Is it all about “me” or is it all about “we”? A strong Moon-Jupiter conjunction has you questioning a serious relationship. Just how much freedom do you want–or need? This goes for business alliances as well as romantic ones. How to maintain a sense of independence within a partnership could be a big question in the near future. With the take-charge Sun now in your house of ambition, chances are you’re going to be looking out more for #1.

"
6397,23 december 2016,aries,"You’re in quite the mysterious mood with the Moon in sultry Scorpio trining Mars. Your intuition could be operating at an extremely high level, not to mention your libido! It’s the perfect day to get in touch with your deepest thoughts and emotions, to soothe your soul and to connect with someone close.

"
6398,24 december 2016,aries,"Maybe the best present Santa is going to bring you is a huge boost in self-esteem! There’s a “hell, yeah, why not?” kind of a vibe going on as rebellious Uranus in your sign is pushing you to take more risks. When Uranus goes direct in your sign on the 29th it will be all systems “go”.

6399,25 december 2016,aries,"Wonderful day for being with people, new faces included. And it’s not because it’s Christmas. Lovely Venus is in your house of networking, forming three sweet angles with other planets. The more the merrier, they say, and that holds true right now. It’s also an excellent day for romance as lucky Jupiter in your commitment zone winks at amorous Venus. Are those wedding bells I’m hearing?
 

"
6400,26 december 2016,aries,"Whose life is it, anyway? A rare opposition between Jupiter and Uranus pits your opinions and dreams against those of people close to you. It may even reach a point where you’re considering moving on from an alliance, be it personal or business. This energy will build as the new moon in your house of ambition and authority arrives on Thursday. You’ll be highly motivated to make big changes in 2017. The question is: who’s going to be with you on your journey?

"
6401,27 december 2016,aries,"That little voice in your head that has been urging you to take more chances is getting louder, Aries. Mars in the house of the subconscious mind is pushing you to live life in a bigger fashion, and with the mighty Sun in your house of ambition, now’s the time to come up with some awesome New Year’s resolutions.

"
6402,28 december 2016,aries,"You’re becoming pretty motivated to get things done, thanks to the high energy Sun in your house of ambition. But don’t try to go it alone. Reach out to people who can help you and that can be a pretty long list: a personal trainer, new housekeeper, booking agent, writing partner, head hunter, doctor, mentor…pick their brains for advice and retain their services if you can afford to do so. When Uranus goes direct tomorrow in your sign, the brakes come off.

"
6403,29 december 2016,aries,"Sweet relief. Uranus ends its retrograde spin in your sign today, ending a five month period of uncertainty and too much juggling. Better yet? The new moon in Capricorn, your house of goal achievement and success. Focus returns and you can apply it to setting those 2017 resolutions.

"
6404,30 december 2016,aries,"Some good things seem to be going on behind the scenes, especially on the work front. Perhaps your name is being mentioned in a favorable way to a decision maker. Or maybe you’re quietly deciding to do something different for a living in 2017. Either way the hush-hush vibe continues into next week, so continue to plot away!

"
6405,31 december 2016,aries,"Ready to plunge in? Planetary aspects recommend taking a risk in love. No, this doesn’t mean dating bad boys or divas. But it does mean being more open to a different kind of lover, or expressing yourself without fear. Being vulnerable is not a weakness; it shows strength of character.

"
6406,1 january 2017,taurus,"Networking with others is the best way to achieve your goals and resolutions for 2017, Taurus! A wonderful Mars-Neptune conjunction encourages you to get out there and mingle. Friends and contacts, both old and new, will be able to help you in so many ways: to find love, more meaningful work, help you contribute to the world via volunteer efforts and simply be an honest source of feedback when you need it. Make it one of your goals to meet as many new people as possible this year!

"
6407,2 january 2017,taurus,"Making new connections and spending fun times with existing friends is on the planets’ agenda for you over the next month, and today is no exception. A positive lunar aspect today could bring about a fortuitous event that involves a close friend, so get on the phone and make plans now. From your chart it appears that an introduction to a new lover could be made, if you’re in the market for love!

"
6408,3 january 2017,taurus,"The hectic pace of the holiday season may start slowing down for you Taurus, now that Venus has just glided into your more relaxed (yet social!) eleventh house. Single bulls may decide to take it easy and release the pressure of finding a new love, at least through the month of January. That being said the possibility of meeting someone is strong; however, you won’t be feeling desperate about it. Coupled up Taureans could invest their time and influence in a volunteer group or a worthy cause. Being around other people is what it’s all about.

"
6409,4 january 2017,taurus,"Devote some time over the next week to reviewing your financial statements and net worth. It’s not because the Tax Man cometh on April 15th. No, Mercury is retrograding today into your house of financial security, urging you to examine your portfolio. Make sure you’re not being over billed for services and that all of the charges on your credit card statements are yours. Better yet, try to negotiate better interest rates on your mortgage and cards. Now’s the time to figure out a plan to pay down debt and save more too.

"
6410,5 january 2017,taurus,"Your emotions could be riding high today, creating a tumultuous situation in which you’re unsure about which way to go. Don’t make any major decisions and wait for the weekend arrive, a much more opportune time for clarity and forward movement. The Sun and Pluto will be meeting in your ninth house of “green lights ahead”, optimism and big picture thinking. Today you’re thinking small. Grab a glass of wine and a book and just chill.

"
6411,6 january 2017,taurus,"Your intuition will be in rare form today, so don’t dismiss what your gut is telling you. And chances are that it will have something to do with a quite personal and emotional matter. You’re about to enter one of the most expansive times in ages, a period in which you could make more progress than you ever dreamed possible. But deal with your demons first. The less baggage you carry, the faster you’ll fly.

"
6412,7 january 2017,taurus,"2017 is not a year for the proud bull to be skulking off to the side of the pasture, watching everyone else have their day in the Sun. Hell, no! And today some major planetary activity is going to light a fire under your butt to get moving. Luckily for you, the Sun and Pluto meet up in one of the most exciting and expansive parts of your chart, the ninth house. This is where you take risks and grow via study, travel and meeting new people with different viewpoints than your own. If there was ever a time to bust out of a rut, this is it!

"
6413,9 january 2017,taurus,"You may have your act together, Taurus, but do the people around you have a clue as to what’s going on? Make sure that everyone knows what their responsibilities are, otherwise you might get stuck doing all of the grunt work. And if someone tries to wrest control of a project or plan in some kind of a head trip, you may have to stand your ground.

"
6414,10 january 2017,taurus,"Say as little as possible today, and keep you eyes open. A tense Uranus-Sun aspect indicates that a frenemy or hidden troll is determined to stir up trouble. Your intuition is strong, but that being said, don’t verbalize your suspicions or annoyance as it could backfire. Sometimes the wisest choice is to say nothing, walk softly and carry a big stick.

"
6415,11 january 2017,taurus,"You’re an idea factory these days Taurus, with transformative and energetic planets blazing trails through the sectors that govern originality, innovation and long range thinking. That’s the good news! The downside is that optimistic Jupiter may be encouraging you to take on too many projects or commitments at once. There simply many not be enough hours in the day. Many self-help gurus say that the smart way to accomplish things is to only take on three goals and work on them until they’re completed, then start in on the rest, a wise piece of advice to consider.

"
6416,12 january 2017,taurus,"You’re ready to close out some projects and goals you’ve been working on so that you can move on to newer ones, and today’s full moon will help you do that. This is an excellent time for taking a class, writing a book, starting a blog, teaching, lecturing and indulging in some shameless self-promotion. Better yet is that quick-witted, intelligent Mercury enters your house of expansive thinking and reaching a wider audience. Just don’t bite off more than you can chew, and make sure that people and services that you’re relying on are staying on top of their end of things.

"
6417,13 january 2017,taurus,"A super romantic Venus-Neptune aspect is a great way to get the weekend rolling. Singles, a friend could make an introduction to a new hottie, and online dating could also be successful (believe it or not). Attached bulls will find it easier to discuss future plans and shared values with someone close, and with Mercury now in your blue-skies-ahead sector, you shouldn’t hold back when it comes to planning.

"
6418,14 january 2017,taurus,"Spend some time this weekend refining your vision about what you’d like to see happen in 2017. Mercury is now in your house of taking in information and thinking outside the box. Then next Thursday the Sun enters Aquarius, your house of achievement. It helps to have the road map drawn up in advance! But don’t forget about love and romance while you’re pondering the future. A sweet aspect in the heavens could bring singles in contact with someone new, while attached bulls should be out mingling with friends and other couples.

"
6419,15 january 2017,taurus,"You only live once, Taurus, but if you do it right once is enough! With magnetic Venus and dynamic Mars both in your house of fun events and new contacts, you need to seize the day. You seem to be wrestling with self-doubt, thinking that you don’t deserve life’s goodies. Hell yeah you do, so go out there and grab them.

"
6420,17 january 2017,taurus,"Some doors seem to be stuck closed while others will swing wide open. Look for the opportunities that you can dive into quickly and don’t fret about the ones you can’t get to right now. The ancients used to say that the cosmos’s delays were not the cosmos’s denials.

"
6421,18 january 2017,taurus,"Your career is just about to take off like a shot, thanks to the mighty Sun blazing into Aquarius on Thursday. To prepare yourself for upcoming advancement, make sure that you’re surrounded by the right kind of people. A productive Mars-Jupiter aspect today will help you work well with team members (even if they’re not cooperative themselves!). Roles may need to be switched up and protocols changed, but it’s necessary for growth. If you’re considering moving on to a new company, networking is a better way to go than just relying on jobs posted on the Internet. It’s now what you know, but who you know.

"
6422,19 january 2017,taurus,"The brakes come off as the Sun barrels into Aquarius, your house of ambition and success. But if you want to move forward you’re going to have to make a decision about the people who may or may not be traveling with you on your journey. Current planetary aspects indicate that not everyone on your “team” is willing to do their share or support your efforts. Is it better to go solo? That’s a decision you’ll be making over the next week, especially around the time of the new moon on the 27th.

"
6423,20 january 2017,taurus,"The mighty bull is scratching the ground, getting ready to charge. That’s because the Sun is now in the most ambitious part of your chart, encouraging you to go after your heart’s desires. The new moon on the 27th is the best time to launch new endeavors. But with megawatt Mars entering your house of secrecy the next day, your best work will be done behind closed doors.

"
6424,21 january 2017,taurus,"Make an effort to work out issues with a lover this weekend as the Moon is in a helpful spot, your house of deeper commitments. A Moon-Chiron trine indicates that it’s time to open up and get clear about long term goals and to make sure that you have the same values. Singles, create a short list of the qualities you want in a mate. Now that the Sun is in your house of ambition and success, you may end up getting just what you want—and need.

"
6425,22 january 2017,taurus,"It’s easy to get into a groove in which we stick with the tried and true, and that includes the people we hang out with. The cosmos recommends that you make an effort to meet some new folks–not that there’s anything wrong with your current pals! But making some fresh connections could help you in big ways, from expanding your mental perspectives to gaining some helpful contacts in love and business. The more the merrier.

"
6426,23 january 2017,taurus,"This entire week is excellent for making long term plans and developing stronger bonds with people, the ones already in your life and the ones you’ve just met. Today is auspicious for having a heart to heart talk with a loved one about what you’d like to see in the future; Tuesday is fine for making new friends and networking; Wednesday helps you connect better with co-workers and group dynamics. It’s all good!

"
6427,24 january 2017,taurus,"It’s wonderful to be surrounded by folks who all seem to enjoy each other’s company and who can work together as a team. Current planetary aspects indicate that the early part of this week is promising for group efforts, whether they’re within the family, your friends or at work. But when the new moon arrives on Friday in the house of your  personal goals and aspirations, these people may suddenly be not as supportive. Just keep your eye on the big picture and soldier on.

"
6428,25 january 2017,taurus,"You may need to learn more to earn more. Transformative Pluto is encouraging you to develop your knowledge base and skill level. But this isn’t just to see more green in your wallet: there’s a happy vibe of curiosity, of learning just for the joy of it. Open up your mind to new philosophies. Read a different kind of a book. Plan a vacation to a far off part of the world that you might not have considered before. Besides, you never know who you might meet along the way.

"
6429,26 january 2017,taurus,"If you want to make progress with your colleagues or a team effort, you’d be wise to coat your words with honey today rather than vinegar. Fortunately smooth-talking Venus is in a good spot to help you. Tomorrow’s new moon falls in your house of ambition, and under current planetary aspects you’re going to need the help of other people, at least for a little while.

"
6430,27 january 2017,taurus,"This is one of the best days in 2017 to kick off new plans, especially if they’re related to your career and making more money. A new moon occurs in your house of goals and success and it’s surrounded by positive aspects. Saturn, the planet of long range planning, is sitting pretty in the financial sector getting ready to show you the money. Abundant Jupiter could bring in new work assignments and better systems for getting things done. Mercury and Pluto are shaking hands in the house that deals with media attention, book deals, or going international. As long as you don’t expect to become a millionaire overnight, you’ll rock it.

"
6431,28 january 2017,taurus,"Remaining discrete is the advice the cosmos sends you as red hot Mars moves into your hush-hush twelfth house. Mars doesn’t necessarily like being contained in such a low key place, but you’d be wise to work quietly behind the scenes over the next few weeks. Yesterday’s new moon fell in your house of career and other ambitious goals. Don’t shout them from the rooftops; slow down, become more reflective, and tie up loose ends.

"
6432,29 january 2017,taurus,"You’re positively visionary! Toss out old ideas and viewpoints and make way for some revolutionary new concepts, Taurus. Your sign is known for sticking to the tried and true, which is excellent when it comes to sticking to good habits and routines. But sometimes you just gotta switch up your way of thinking, and with metamorphic Pluto stirring up your house of thinking outside the box, today’s a good time to open the windows of your mind.

"
6433,30 january 2017,taurus,"Romance is in the air as the passionate Moon and amorous Neptune meet in the heavens. Singles, an introduction from a friend could be just what you need now, although success with online dating is also in the stars. Couples, this is a good day to share your ideas about the future and discuss the next steps. You’re in more of a take charge mood these days, Taurus, so don’t sit back and wait for things to happen.

"
6434,31 january 2017,taurus,"Sometimes you just have to just go with what feels right and push past your fears, and that’s what the cosmos is telling you to do today. Intelligent Mercury is opening up you mind to new ideas—are you open to trying them? A lack of confidence could arise, or a little voice saying “I tried that before and it didn’t work.” Well this time it just might, but you’ll never know unless you try, right?

"
6435,1 february 2017,taurus,"Co-workers or clients could be in a button-pushing mood, Taurus, and you may need to summon up a mountain of patience in order to deal with them. Trouble is, the Moon could make you quite emotional today, or suspicious. Even if someone isn’t in your face you could sense some resistance coming from them. Let this pass and wait until next Monday if you can, when Jupiter goes retrograde in your house of work. You’ll be able to figure out what’s going on with much greater clarity.

"
6436,2 february 2017,taurus,"A more tender touch should be used in personal relationships, especially when it comes to kids or a lover. Sometimes we have to switch up our methods of motivating others, communicating with them and just showing them love, and that’s what the cosmos is telling you to do today. Mars is pushing you to do some helpful inner work that will make life flow so much easier; pay attention!

"
6437,3 february 2017,taurus,"50 Shades of Taurus? Now that amorous Venus is in your house of mystery, secrets and uh, forbidden fruit, you could enjoy quite a libidinous February. Singles, just make sure that you’re not being seduced 100% by someone’s sex appeal if what you’re really looking for is commitment and a soulmate. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with a damn sexy soulmate, so happy hunting.

"
6438,4 february 2017,taurus,"Bill Gates and people of his ilk are often referred to as being “visionaries”, but that title just doesn’t apply to a select few. Your ability to see a much bigger picture skyrockets today with a sparkling Moon-Pluto trine. The Moon is in your house of self, so it all comes down to making the most of what lies within. When intelligent Mercury enters your ambition sector next week, all systems are go.

"
6439,5 february 2017,taurus,"Mixed signals coming from someone close might make you feel unsettled, but this is a temporary blip. Over the next two months you’ll be doing a lot of soul searching now that Venus is in the house of your subconscious mind and emotions. As a result, you’ll have your good days and the more challenging ones, but in the end you’ll emerge a happier, more serene person. Besides, once Mercury enters your house of ambition on Tuesday you’ll become more focused on your own plans and not so engaged in the dramas that other people create.
.

"
6440,6 february 2017,taurus,"The stalwart bull likes to plunge ahead, knocking down obstacles and making progress. But the cosmos is urging you to take a slower pace between now and early June, thanks to Jupiter going retrograde today in your house of work assignments and efficiency. Tighten up policies and procedures, let go of dead wood employees, switch service providers that aren’t responsive to your needs, and consider your own personal work habits. You’ll need to take action ASAP as Mercury enters your house of ambition tomorrow.

"
6441,7 february 2017,taurus,"Reach out to mentors and the powers that be, Taurus. Mercury just entered your achievement sector and you’d be wise to hear the opinions of experts before you make your next move. This isn’t just about career success, although it can mean that. Being a better parent, losing weight, making smart investments, breaking a bad habit–all of these qualify as “achievement”. There is plenty of sound advice out there–seek it.

"
6442,8 february 2017,taurus,"A project could go off the rails today, Taurus, but the good news is that you can get it back on track tomorrow. Whether it’s a diet, home remodeling plan, a client presentation or group effort at the office, it looks like things are moving too fast. Tighten them up, keep your opinions to yourself and don’t lose focus on the end result.

"
6443,9 february 2017,taurus,"A quick “psychic hit” could come your way today, and the news it brings will have to do with your bigger ambitions. Your intuition is your best friend right now, thanks to hosting magnetic Venus and spontaneous Uranus in the house of the subconscious mind. They’re both going to be active over the next three days so pay attention to your gut.

"
6444,10 february 2017,taurus,"Homebody? A new series of eclipses in Leo begins tonight in your domestic sector, stretching all the way into 2019. Let’s put it this way: your family life and residential situation will be dramatically  different within two years’ time. Moving to a new town, getting engaged, starting a family, handling issues with your parents and siblings—all of these will be on the table. The job of an eclipse is to get us out of a rut and they tend to act quickly. The current one is a honey, helping you get organized at home and possibly line up money for a down payment on a house or a security deposit. There are excellent career aspects too, so plan an interview if you’re looking for more cash and responsibility.

"
6445,11 february 2017,taurus,"You have what it takes, Taurus. A super Sun-Jupiter trine will enable you to show off your talents and skills in the workplace over the next week. Schedule job interviews and client presentations. Dive into a new aspect of the business that you haven’t tried before. Tackling new projects should be easier, not to mention profitable in the long run.

"
6446,12 february 2017,taurus,"“I’m a lover, not a fighter.” This may be your mantra today as the emotional Moon opposes Neptune. If people around you want to create drama, whether it’s a pal, spouse or family member, walk away. Let them wallow in their own theatrics. You’ve got better things to do with your time.

"
6447,13 february 2017,taurus,"You may need to switch up your approach when it comes to a project you’re working on, as the cosmos suggests that more creativity is needed. It doesn’t matter whether you’re redecorating your bedroom or working on a client presentation–try a fresh idea, a different way of going about things. You’ll be happy you did as you’ll end up seeing more favorable results right away, especially over the next two weeks.

"
6448,14 february 2017,taurus,"A sweet cooperative vibe pervades this Valentine’s Day, Taurus. With mature Saturn in the sector that governs your most intimate emotions, you should really be on target with your feelings. There’s no room in your life right now for jealousy, resentment or drama in love. If a romance needs to get straightened out then you’re the person to do it, as the Sun is in the most authoritative part of your chart. You’re responsible for your own personal happiness—remember that.

"
6449,15 february 2017,taurus,"Your confidence may rise over a business success. Perhaps you’re going to win that promotion, or a new client is getting ready to sign on the dotted line. Maybe you just feel as though you’re becoming a stronger player. Kudos! But you might want to keep it humble, even subdued, as there could be a hidden troll in your midst. Don’t give away too much, not only today but all the way through the end of next week. Your aspects for success are excellent but confidentiality is key.

"
6450,16 february 2017,taurus,"You’re more than ready to tackle new things thanks to a strong Mercury-Mars meeting. If your life needs more structure you’ll be able to develop it, which includes solid habits and systems for getting things done. But Rome wasn’t built in a day, so don’t try to completely overhaul your life in too short a period of time.

"
6451,17 february 2017,taurus,"Be selective when it comes to choosing people to partner with, whether its on a personal level or a business one. With the Sun about to enter the friendliest part of your chart you may be ready to welcome everyone with open arms. However, some folks are just not a good fit. Your intuition is working in high gear—use it to your advantage.

"
6452,18 february 2017,taurus,"Who’s on Team Taurus? That’s the big question over the next four weeks as the Sun enters your house of networking today. With a solar eclipse occurring here on the 26th, the last one in a series that has been going on since 2015, it may be time for some new faces and connections. Group efforts that have been going on for awhile may now finally come to a successful close.

"
6453,19 february 2017,taurus,"It’s a honey of a day for spiritual clearing. If you’ve been critical of yourself, always seeing the flaws and not the beauty that resides within you, today’s Moon-Venus trine will help you change your viewpoint. Make a vow to be better to yourself–and kinder.

"
6454,20 february 2017,taurus,"This is one of your best weeks in ages to make a good impression on others, thanks to intelligent, eloquent Mercury in your house of ambition. Today it forms a brilliant aspect with Uranus, the planet of genius–and fast results. As a result, if you have an idea or plan that you believe is worthwhile, then you must take action on it. Better yet–showcase it to people who are decision makers.

"
6455,21 february 2017,taurus,"Ready, aim, fire! Get your ducks lined up because a profitable Mercury-Jupiter trine bodes well for taking an idea from the conceptual arena to the planning stage. Plot out what needs to be done, then get moving. Great day to impress a boss with your can-do attitude.

"
6456,22 february 2017,taurus,"Walk softly and carry a big stick. The two most obstinate planets, Mars and Pluto, are squaring off in the heavens, bringing about a power grab on the part of someone you know. Observe, deduce but don’t act. Keep your words and opinions to yourself. This isn’t weakness–it’s actually strength. This battle is not worth fighting, at least not now.

"
6457,23 february 2017,taurus,"Are you on the right path when it comes to your career? Today both your logical side and creative one will be holding a conversation about your future. With Sunday’s lunar eclipse falling in your house of deeply held dreams, you may be on the verge of making a major decision.

"
6458,24 february 2017,taurus,"What you are interested in doing may not mesh with what others have in mind, but that doesn’t mean that you should cave to their wishes. On the contrary! A secretive Venus-Moon aspect today tells you to pursue your own plans without making a big noise about it. But over the next few weeks you would be wise to at least look like a team player.

"
6459,25 february 2017,taurus,"Collaborations pick up steam now that clever Mercury is in your house of team activities. Not only can you make purpose-filled new affiliations, you can also share good times with your friends. A solar eclipse tomorrow in this part of your chart will bring in many new faces, so get ready to join forces with like-minded people.

"
6460,26 february 2017,taurus,"The best way for you to get ahead in life is by joining forces with others. Taurus. A solar eclipse in your house of networking suggests that friends, colleagues, former bosses, and neighbors can bring you what you need: new love, a higher paying job, more friends, and people who share your values. Charitable work and social action are highly favored, so don’t just sit there–call a friend!

"
6461,27 february 2017,taurus,"First, the good news: your intuition is working double overtime, providing you with information that’s valuable. Now for the less-than-stellar news: you may be realizing (thanks to the sixth sense) that someone doesn’t have your back, or that a circumstance just doesn’t fit you anymore. This could turn to anger pretty quickly, so think before you speak or act.

"
6462,28 february 2017,taurus,"Growing pains. You might be feeling them today as metamorphic Pluto encourages you to break out of a rut or your shell, yet gentle Venus is warning “Wait! I’m not ready!” Honey, you can’t stay in the shadows too much longer. Megawatt Mars is about to enter your sign on March 9th, its first visit here in two years. Get your act together, dust yourself off and get ready to be on center stage.

"
6463,1 march 2017,taurus,"Work that contact list! A super Sun-Neptune aspect rocks for making progress with the help of others. Team projects, volunteer groups, industry think tanks—all of these can be your ticket to a brighter and more fulfilled future. Tech ventures are highly favored too, so redesign your website, launch a social media campaign or even consider online dating for finding new love.

"
6464,3 march 2017,taurus,"Out with the old, in with the new. The saying “but we’ve always done it this way” needs to be removed from your brain! A cosmic shakeup is pushing you to think outside the box and consider new options. A luscious Moon-Pluto trine today is perfect for not only making a few tweaks, but a major metamorphosis.

"
6465,4 march 2017,taurus,"Need some down time to lick your wounds? The next four weeks are perfect for cocooning yourself away from the world a bit and indulging in some extreme self-care. This is a healing time when you can overcome grief, resentment and negativity. Forgive, release and move on. You can do this on your own, but a therapist, minister or trusted confidante could also be a big help.

"
6466,5 march 2017,taurus,"Your psychological health is just as important as your physical vitality, and today you can take great strides in cleansing your mind of what ails you. This may entail opening up and spilling your emotions and thoughts to someone, but the end result will be worth it. Meditation, energy work, affirmations, visualization: all of these are tools that will help you.

"
6467,6 march 2017,taurus,"It’s an excellent day to forge a dynamic connection. Join a professional group, socialize, make new friends and consider joining a team of like-minded individuals. This energy will continue all week, so keep your radar up. The contacts you make right now can add to the quality of your life in so many ways.

"
6468,7 march 2017,taurus,"Teamwork is the planets’ focus for you this week, Taurus. But today you may need to tiptoe around others, or keep your opinion to yourself. You have some excellent ideas and insights, but other people may not be ready for them. Wait until Wednesday to share.

"
6469,8 march 2017,taurus,"There is nothing  holding you back, Taurus! Where there’s a will there’s a way, and with the two most optimistic and forward-thinking sectors lit up, you’ll be able to figure out how to get past obstacles. This energy continues into Thursday when….a drumroll, please…Mars enters your sign. Stop feeling sorry for yourself or think you don’t have what it takes. You do. Find a way.

"
6470,9 march 2017,taurus,"Yeah, baby! Mars is now in Taurus, making you the guy or gal to watch. Take this energy and run with it. Ask for the business, ask for the date, showcase your talents, make new friends, lose some weight, speak up, socialize and overall, have some fun. You just have to watch the tendency to become too bull-headed. Remember that your dreams, passions and timelines may not be the same as someone else’s.

"
6471,10 march 2017,taurus,"Invite some friends over for dinner or drinks this weekend, Taurus. The planets are encouraging you to socialize more with people who truly understand and appreciate you. And with Sunday’s full moon falling in your house of romance, plan a sexy rendezvous with your amour. No amour in sight? The full moon could put an end to that situation! Pals could play matchmaker under these aspects—just one more reason to invite them over.

"
6472,11 march 2017,taurus,"Don’t let others talk you out of your dreams, Taurus! Friends and family may mean well but you know in your heart what is best for you. A highly creative and convivial time is about to open up in your life, thanks to Sunday’s full moon in Virgo. You can’t travel to a distant new land if you don’t leave the shore.

"
6473,12 march 2017,taurus,"Sweet! A full moon glows in your house of romance and enjoying life, Taurus. But while you’re busy wining, dining and canoodling, make sure that you’re coming from the same place as your lover. A tense Mercury-Saturn aspect indicates that you can’t gloss over such an important facet of a relationship. Singles, unless you’re looking for a quick fling, take your time when dating someone new. That said, this lunation could bring in a fresh prospect.

"
6474,13 march 2017,taurus,"Sit with your emotions, Taurus. Sift through old baggage and forgive the transgressions of others so that you can heal and move on. Intelligent Mercury enters the house of your subconscious mind today, setting the stage for mental healing. The next few weeks are a good time to begin a meditation practice and take time alone for yourself every day.

"
6475,14 march 2017,taurus,"Snark alert. Stay on your toes at the office, school or in a team activity as it appears that someone will be working their own agenda. The problem is that with a Moon-Jupiter conjunction you may be so optimistic and open-minded that you won’t be able to see it. Of course, if someone openly goes on a power trip, you’ll know it. Be watchful and remain calm.

"
6476,15 march 2017,taurus,"With the recent full moon falling in your house of romance, you may be thinking about what you can do to improve your love life. And with red hot Mars confidently striding through your house of image, one of the best places to start is with your own level of self esteem. It may be time for an emotional makeover, something you can start once the Sun enters Aries on the 20th.

"
6477,16 march 2017,taurus,"Sober Saturn in your house of intimacy demands more maturity and peace in your relationship. That includes you singles who are on the market; no more divas and players! All bulls will be seeking clarity, especially with tomorrow’s tough Sun-Saturn meet up. It’s crucial to be upon the same page as a lover. They need to share your goals and values, otherwise it may be time to move on.

"
6478,17 march 2017,taurus,"Getting a solid grip on your finances is the order of the day with a sobering Sun-Saturn square. The size of your dreams may currently not match the size of your bank account, as disciplinarian Saturn will point out. Does this mean you should give up on cherished ideas? Heck no! But start doing some deep thinking about how you can change the way you’re going about saving, spending, investing and earning money.

"
6479,18 march 2017,taurus,"Secret lover? Hmmm. With Mercury holding a convo with romantic Venus in your hush-hush twelfth house, sexy bulls could be considering an affair! Or maybe a secluded weekend in the boudoir with your Significant Other. Singles, you could be harboring a secret crush…or perhaps someone is crushing on you.

"
6480,19 march 2017,taurus,"From your chart it appears that you have some big decisions to make, some of which are life changing. When the Sun enters Aries tomorrow you’ll be entering a highly reflective phase. But you can get started today with resolutions concerning your net worth as well as your romance, thanks to the Moon touching these areas. There is no need to make a decision now, but at least start ruminating.

"
6481,20 march 2017,taurus,"Craving privacy? Feel the need to unwind, rest and reflect? That’s because the Sun has just entered your twelfth house of healing and closure. The next four weeks can be highly cathartic if you set your mind to it–literally. Learn how to meditate, talk to a therapist or close confidante, keep a dream journal or study Buddhism. Use any modality that helps you get centered and happy again.

"
6482,21 march 2017,taurus,"An inspirational Moon-Pluto connection helps you think on grander terms, and with this mind-expanding vibe could come the desire to learn more. Sign up for a class or seminar. Listen to podcasts or pick up some good books on a topic of interest to you. Just don’t rush the process, expecting to have answers or be an expert in record time. Practice makes perfect here.

"
6483,22 march 2017,taurus,"You may be raring to go with any number of opportunities but the sensible thing to do right now is nothing. That is until you’ve given plenty of thought to which plan or idea is the best one to pursue over the next few weeks. Your intuition is strong today–use it for guidance.

"
6484,23 march 2017,taurus,"You would be wise to keep cutting edge ideas to yourself, as other people around you may be more than happy to either claim them for their own or try to stymie your progress. While you’re at it, keep your opinions to yourself too. A tough Mercury-Pluto aspect indicates that someone may be lurking in the shadows, operating at cross purposes to you. Don’t get them any ammunition to use against you.

"
6485,24 march 2017,taurus,"Don’t kid yourself about what you can accomplish in a given time period, whether it’s a project at home or work. Optimistic Jupiter may have you thinking that you can take on the world. However, rational Mercury is saying otherwise, so get real about commitments and your schedule. You may have to cut certain obligations and activities in order to focus on just a few that are the most important.

"
6486,25 march 2017,taurus,"You’re in a powerfully transitional time right now, Taurus. Sometimes making big decisions or changes is tough, but other times it’s easy. Luckily sweet Venus meets up with the authoritative Sun today, allowing changes to happen without a lot of fear, drama and resistance. Momentum will build over the next three weeks.

"
6487,26 march 2017,taurus,"Intuition alert! Yours will be spot on today with a meeting of two of the most mental planets, Mercury and Uranus, in the house of the subconscious mind. Something might hit you—an idea, an emotion, a suspicion, a glimpse of what lies in the future—and it may come quickly, out of the blue. Don’t dismiss these thoughts; they are gifts from the cosmos.

"
6488,27 march 2017,taurus,"With Mars in your sign you are unstoppable, Taurus. Today the red planet forms a glistening aspect with inspirational Neptune in your house of dreams and wishes. It’s the perfect time to envision the future and what you’d like to experience in the months and years ahead. Tuesday’s new moon is all about releasing parts of your past that are no longer useful or may be holding you back. You can’t voyage to new lands unless you’re willing to leave the shore.

"
6489,28 march 2017,taurus,"Some serious R & R is on the cosmos’s agenda for you, Taurus. If you’ve been putting in long hours at work, or relationships with others have been causing stress, it’s time to relax, regroup and recharge your batteries. The new moon in Aries urges you to cleanse your weary soul of trouble, especially the romantic kind as love planet Venus is in a good angle.

"
6490,29 march 2017,taurus,"Inspiration for building your net worth could arrive today in the form of a gut hunch or a dream. As a result, don’t discount ideas that pop into your head or what appears to be a random remark from someone you know. The good thing is that logical Saturn is in the house of your subconscious mind, so these hunches will be based on fact and not on fantasy.

"
6491,30 march 2017,taurus,"With Mars in Taurus you may be feeling self-assured and extremely motivated, but you have to remember that not everyone else is. Avoid the tendency to push people too hard, too fast when it comes to getting things done, whether it’s at home or at the office. You may also be pushing yourself too hard, so dial things down a notch. Don’t worry—everything will be completed eventually.

"
6492,31 march 2017,taurus,"Woo-hoo! Magnetic Mercury, the planet that helps you speak with eloquence and makes your mind as sharp as a tack, enters Taurus today. Better yet is that it joins Mars, the most assertive planet in the solar system. This is a terrific time to speak up for yourself, plan the next phase of your life, negotiate business deals or a new job, or reinvent your image. But hustle, because Mercury retrogrades here on April 9th.

"
6493,1 april 2017,taurus,"Phew! The last six weeks may have been onerous, courtesy of Venus moving backward through one of the most sensitive parts of your chart. Hopefully you’ve released grudges and resentment, especially the kind directed at old flames. Toss that torch you’ve been carrying and get ready to meet someone new. Coupled up bulls should have worked on their issues as well. Venus moves into your house of values and cherished dreams tomorrow, so plan to make a decision as to what is really important to you.

"
6494,2 april 2017,taurus,"You may need to make amends with a friend, but it will be worth the discomfort. Now that magnetic Venus is retrograding through your house of close contacts, it’s time to reconnect with people you’ve lost touch with–and those with whom there’s been some friction. Once Venus resumes direct motion on the 15th you should be enjoying a far more social scene.

"
6495,3 april 2017,taurus,"You may be in a candid mood, ready to open up and express your opinions and ideas, but the planets warn against being too transparent. Keep some of your cards close to your vest. That said, be a part of a team, chat with your friends and have a discussion with your lover. Just be circumspect with the amount of kind of information you release.

"
6496,4 april 2017,taurus,"Your emotions might get the better of you, so think before you act or talk. Ungrounded fears might be making you concerned about the future. Your heart and head will be sending mixed messages, so this is definitely not a good time to make any major decisions. When logical Saturn begins to retrograde in your house of emotions and deepest thoughts on Thursday you’ll have the time to think things through.

"
6497,5 april 2017,taurus,"Playing nice with family members and friends can be a blessing for all of you. You can make the day of someone who is going through a hard time, and in doing so you’ll end up feeling such a sense of contentment. The best part is that they’ll be there for you when you need it.

"
6498,6 april 2017,taurus,"Romantic liaisons take a serious turn now that mature Saturn is retrograding in your house of intimacy. The next few months are critical for getting to the root of any problems in your relationship. Singles should get clear about what they want from a partner, and all bulls need to let go of drama, jealousy and past wounds. Will your romance survive? Saturn is the planet of the long term, so if your union is strong it should last.

"
6499,7 april 2017,taurus,"If you feel like being a doormat or a work horse, then today’s your day. Others will be glad to dump on you if you allow them to. If, however, you have healthy self-esteem and boundaries, you’ll need to let those qualities show. With so much planetary activity in your efficiency zone you’re looking like a can-do person, which can have its downside. Don’t let others assume that you’re dying to take on more work.

"
6500,8 april 2017,taurus,"The button pushers are out there today and they might have you in their cross hairs, Taurus! Be wary of people who seem to have an axe to grind, want to stir up drama or push you around. The problem is that the more you respond the worse it will get. If you can, just grab a good book and hide away somewhere—or go to a day spa for an extensive set of treatments.

"
6501,9 april 2017,taurus,"Time for some self-reflection! Intelligent Mercury just went retrograde in your sign, forcing you to examine your thoughts, beliefs and plans. While you may feel misunderstood and perhaps even unappreciated in the weeks ahead, you can still make progress. Between now and the 20th focus less on what other think and want and more on what floats your boat.

"
6502,10 april 2017,taurus,"With optimistic Jupiter in your house of productivity this is an excellent time to figure out the most important things that need to be done. But in order to do that you need to drown out the voices of people who are weighing in with their opinions. Only you can create a short list.

"
6503,11 april 2017,taurus,"New life is breathed into work assignments and other plans as a full moon illuminates the heavens. It occurs in your detail-oriented sector of efficiency, giving you the can-do attitude to get things done. Just be aware that you may be flying solo, as others are either unwilling to help or stuck in their own vision of how things should progress. That’s OK–you can make faster progress if their baggage isn’t holding you back.

"
6504,12 april 2017,taurus,"Working well with others isn’t always easy, and indeed the planets are encouraging you to do as much as you can on your own. But it wouldn’t hurt to at least pretend that you’re interested in being a team player, at least for the next few days. When Venus stations direct on Saturday people will become more cooperative.

"
6505,13 april 2017,taurus,"Your desire to take a bold risk is increasing, Taurus, but this may mean making a break from the past. So be it. Today’s a good time to talk over your new ideas with the people closest to you to see if they’re on board. Once Venus resumes direct motion on Saturday it will be even easier to reach an agreement and rally the troops.

"
6506,14 april 2017,taurus,"I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more! That old line is your mantra today as rebellious Uranus pushes you to the breaking point. It could be an unfulfilling job or relationship. The face that you can’t zip your pants anymore due to the gut roll. A person who keeps putting you down. Dependency on cigarettes or another unhealthy substance. The time to change is now, Taurus. What are you waiting for?

"
6507,15 april 2017,taurus,"Yassss. Love planet Venus goes direct after a four-week back spin, easing relationships not only with an amour but also friends and colleagues. Momentum can start to build in team efforts, such as a departmental task at the office or planning a wedding, family reunion or charity event. There will always be friction of some kind in a group activity, but Venus’s direct turn will give you the gift of diplomacy.

"
6508,16 april 2017,taurus,"Romance takes a sexy turn with the two cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, in a sweet angle today. A friend could play matchmaker to you singles, and online dating sites could also produce (gasp!) a winner. Coupled up bulls will find it easier to discuss the big picture with their amour. With the Sun getting ready to enter your sign it’s a great time to think about what you’d like to experience over the next year.

"
6509,17 april 2017,taurus,"Dig deep, Taurus, deep into your emotions. If you need to release any bad mojo today’s the day to do so. A powerful meeting between two no-nonsense orbs, the Sun and Saturn, encourages you to release old mental traumas and let them go. Saturn is the planet of discipline and the long term, so its presence is important for making things stick.

"
6510,18 april 2017,taurus,"You can’t force enthusiasm to just pour out of you if you’re not really feeling it. The good news is that the Sun is about to enter your sign, getting you jazzed up to chase down some exciting dreams. But Pluto retrogrades Thursday in your visionary ninth house, which might make you pause and wonder if you’re on the right track. Don’t let Pluto’s retro turn dampen your optimism. Instead, use it to refine your vision.

"
6511,19 april 2017,taurus,"Happy birthday Taurus! Now that the Sun is crowning you the celestial favorite of the zodiac for the next four weeks you can try your hand at all sorts of new experiences, meet fresh faces and party your little heart out. However, make sure to book some down time for nurturing and pampering yourself. With Mercury about to retrograde in the most secluded part of your chart, it’s the perfect opportunity to practice some extreme self care.

"
6512,20 april 2017,taurus,"A big concept is no better than the sum of its parts, something that you would be wise to remember over the next few months. Pluto retrogrades in your big-picture-thinking sector, urging you to ferret out weaknesses in a plan or project. This little planet demands that shaky foundations be torn down, but the upside is that it will help you rebuild with fortitude. Slow and steady will win out over fast and sloppy.

"
6513,21 april 2017,taurus,"Hope you’re well-rested. Mars enters your income sector, helping you pull on more dinero through your own business, a raise or a brand new job. But when the red planet enters this part of someone’s chart it often demands long hours, more cooperation with co-workers and clients, and sometimes punishing deadlines. Considering that both Mercury and Pluto went retrograde yesterday, you’ll need to resist the urge to blast forward with projects. Take your time and do things right.

"
6514,22 april 2017,taurus,"The size of your wallet may not match the size of your dreams, Taurus. Luxe Venus is aching to spend some cash: not necessarily on extras but big ticket items, like a house, car, boat or even funding your own business. While there’s nothing wrong with pursuing your dreams, serious Saturn is telling you to bank more cash and pay down debt before you go down that path.

"
6515,23 april 2017,taurus,"Friends with benefits? It could happen today, Taurus! Of course whether that’s a smart idea or not is another story. With the Moon and love planet Venus linking up in your friendship sector, anything could happen, such as a pal introducing you to a new hottie. Online dating could also work out, believe it or not. Couples might find that it’s more fun to socialize with friends rather than spending the day with just your amour.

"
6516,24 april 2017,taurus,"Take off the rose colored glasses. Stop placing someone on a pedestal. Drop the resentment and grudges. Stern Saturn tells you to delete the negative and sometimes foolish thoughts that we entertain when it comes to love, whether they’re around a current amour or an ex. The good news is that if you make the effort to do this inner work, the results will stick.

"
6517,25 april 2017,taurus,"Catharsis! A surprising breakthrough can occur which will help you release some of the troublesome bonds of the past. Tomorrow’s new moon falls in your sign, Taurus, and other planets are working hard to empty your mind and soul of toxic trash so that you can move forward with confidence. Create some healthy new habits, such as repeating affirmations in the morning or meditating. Disciplinarian Saturn is in a good spot to help you stick to them and reap the rewards of a clear mind.

"
6518,26 april 2017,taurus,"Your personal new year begins today, thanks to a luscious new moon in your sign, Taurus. Spontaneous Uranus is acting out in a good way, telling you to toss out preconceived notions as to what you’re capable of. There’s a strong healing vibe in the air, so let the past go and charge forward like the stalwart bull that you are. Once Venus changes signs on Friday your imagination and intuition will increase dramatically, so use these skills to help plan the next phase of your life.

"
6519,27 april 2017,taurus,"Hurry up and wait? The new moon in Taurus yesterday kicked off a six-month period in which you can pursue any goal of your choosing, and today you may feel like a kid in a candy shop as you consider the possibilities. A Moon-Pluto trine is helping you think big and bold, but don’t blast forward just yet. An impatient approach will lead to mistakes. Slow down and consider all of your options.

"
6520,28 april 2017,taurus,"Romantic Venus glides into the dreamiest part of your chart, which stirs up fantasies and the desire to bond with another. Which is fine….as long as you’re keeping it real. Besides, the recent new moon occurred in your sign, which puts your needs front and center. Don’t be shy about having expectations from someone you love. Otherwise you’ll end up being a doormat.

"
6521,29 april 2017,taurus,"There’s no place for emotional spending this weekend with a sobering Moon-Saturn aspect. Keep your credit cards in your wallet and avoid car, boat and furniture showrooms. Mars is tearing through your house of money. Unfortunately, it can tear through your savings too. Play it safe instead.

"
6522,30 april 2017,taurus,"With the Sun in your sign it’s all systems go when it comes to achieving personal projects that are important to you. Today is a winner for seeking advice, strategizing, doing research or rubbing elbows with folks who can help you. Don’t rush this process, however. Now that Venus is in your hush-hush house of confidential planning, you need to be circumspect about just how much you share.

"
6523,1 may 2017,taurus,"Your intuition is razor sharp today, thanks to a powerful meeting of intelligent Mercury and vibey Uranus. Indeed, you might end up being amazed at the kind of information your gut provides you with. But no matter how strongly you feel it, or how accurate you think it is, keep it to yourself. This is not the time for venting.

"
6524,2 may 2017,taurus,"Your self-esteem gets a boost thanks to a sweet lunar aspect that is designed to help you release some of the negativity of the past. Considering that Mercury has been retrograde for several weeks in the house of the subconscious mind, you may have been doing some inner work. It moves direct tomorrow, so get ready to face the world with a brand new attitude.

"
6525,4 may 2017,taurus,"The Sun is shining in Taurus Land, putting your dreams on center stage. And what a day it is to dream! A glorious Sun-Neptune trine stirs up your creative juices as you consider all sorts of yummy possibilities for the future, in all areas of your life. Inspirational Neptune opens up the floodgates to the realm of hidden wisdom that exists in the ether. Let it pour in.

"
6526,5 may 2017,taurus,"Reconsider your productivity level. Are you truly getting things done as efficiently as possible, both at home and at work? Is your life relatively stress free because you have good systems in place? If not, it’s time to get real and make some changes. Fortunately they’ll be easier to implement than you might expect as optimistic, abundant Jupiter is in your house of getting things done.

"
6527,6 may 2017,taurus,"Feeling emo? Not surprising with today’s Moon-Saturn square. Saturn demands maturity and logic and happens to be in one of the houses that governs our deepest thoughts and feelings. So while one part of you may feel like going on a crying jag, pitching a fit, acting jealous or demanding answers from someone, the ringed planet tells you to snap out of it. Now.

"
6528,7 may 2017,taurus,"Over the next week you may realize that the “rules” governing a friendship or team effort need to be rewritten. With the Sun in your sign your self-esteem is rising and you’re less willing to put up with people’s nonsense or lack of work ethic. Today’s a good time to diplomatically try to make changes. Otherwise things could get heated by the 11th.

"
6529,8 may 2017,taurus,"Your head and your heart may be at odds today, and from your chart it looks like your logical left brain is going to win this battle. Intelligent Mercury is zipping through the sector of the subconscious mind, pumping up your intuition. As a result you may be able to read between the lines of what people are saying. Wisdom, not emotion, should guide your decisions.

"
6530,9 may 2017,taurus,"You’re in brainiac mode these days, Taurus, what with the Sun in your sign and Mercury in the house of the subconscious mind. Ideas may be popping up left and right and some of them have incredible long term potential, something that might become apparent today. The next few days are excellent for showcasing and promoting your ideas to power brokers, not to mention landing media attention. Don’t hold back.

"
6531,10 may 2017,taurus,"Serious commitments of all kinds are in the spotlight of tonight’s full moon in Scorpio. Mercury and maverick Uranus are meeting up in the heavens too, in the deepest part of your subconscious mind. This means that you may decide to suddenly walk away from a situation that is burdensome or toxic, such as a romance that’s been on the rocks or a business alliance that’s more trouble than it’s worth. The good news is that you’re in quite a visionary place these days so your decisions will be far reaching. This includes the decision to marry, start a family or enter into a business partnership that could end up being quite profitable.

"
6532,11 may 2017,taurus,"Don’t hold back! A super trine, the best angle possible in astrology, occurs today between the Sun and Pluto. Picture these two as strategists who are holding a powwow, determined to bust you out of a rut and kick your sorry butt into an exciting new stratosphere. The best part is that this won’t be a fantasy land full of unicorns and rainbows: it will be the real world, just at a much higher playing field. Pack your bags.

"
6533,12 may 2017,taurus,"Mars is making you more determined than ever to develop better habits, especially when it comes to earning or saving more dinero. And today it forms a magnificent trine with optimistic Jupiter in your efficiency sector. This is the perfect weekend to go through financial statements, balance your checkbook and strategize as to how you can boost your income. Generous Jupiter is in fine form, trying to land you better clients, work assignments, a nicer office environment and perhaps even a new gig. Don’t waste this valuable energy.

"
6534,13 may 2017,taurus,"Which is going to win—your emotions or your logic? They’re at odds today, but at least it’s a minor altercation and not an out-and-out brawl. With the Sun in your sign you are redefining who you are and what you want to do with your life. Different possibilities are bubbling to the surface of your mind—thus the confusion. When Mercury enters your sign next Tuesday things will become more clear.

"
6535,14 may 2017,taurus,"You shouldn’t be doing all the heavy lifting and grunt work, whether it’s at home, at work or within a volunteer organization you’re part of. And you won’t have to, thanks to a sweet aspect in the heavens that is telling you that teamwork is the way to go. “Yeah, right” you may be saying, “You don’t know what my co-workers are like. Or my kids.” Listen, inspirational Neptune is trying to help you, along with optimistic Jupiter. Create rules and consequences at home, stop being the office go-to person, search for hacks that will reduce your time doing chores or speed up your work flow. Megamouth Mercury enters your sign on Tuesday. Speak up!

"
6536,15 may 2017,taurus,"Yikes, get out of Taurus’s way today. They’re not pissed—they’re passionate.  A powerful meet up of the emotional Moon and determined Pluto in the most adventurous part of their chart is making them more than ready to bust out of a rut. It doesn’t matter where that rut may be—love, career, friendships, body image, finances—but they’re gonna move on.

"
6537,16 may 2017,taurus,"No hiding in the shadows for you, Taurus. Today Mercury enters your sign, making you the guy or the gal with the right attitude, magnetism and ideas. Then on Saturday the Sun enters Gemini, kicking off a four-week period in which you can network for any purpose you have in mind: finding new love or a new gig, talking to movers and shakers about an entrepreneurial venture, meeting the neighbors or getting involved in charity work. A busy, social time lies ahead, so get rested now!

"
6538,17 may 2017,taurus,"If you need to rally the troops (your kids, co-workers, team members) today’s the day to start making inspirational speeches. You will actually be able to gain control over a situation and steer it to a successful finale without overtly pressuring people to get things done. This is the “iron hand in the velvet glove” routine so use it to your advantage.

"
6539,19 may 2017,taurus,"If improving your mindset has been difficult to do, along with breaking bad habits and cutting toxic ties, today is a game changer. A rare Saturn-Uranus aspect takes place that can bring an epiphany, a sudden realization that change is possible. Are you going to have to do some inner work? Yes. Might you need the wise counsel of a therapist, friend or minister? Maybe. But the good news is that between now and mid-November these two planets will be in a close, cathartic angle. Take advantage of it, my friend.

"
6540,20 may 2017,taurus,"Cha-ching! The proud bull loves that sound (don’t we all?) but your sign is the most likely to latch on to cash. And fortunately for you, the Sun enters your earnings sector today for a four-week stay. This happens every year in May, but what makes 2017 different is that aggressive Mars is in the same house. This can act as a double edged sword: you can be spending like a drunken sailor on shore leave, or you can be hustling like mad to line up new sources of income while you build up your savings. There will be a new moon in this sector next Thursday, so get ready to launch job hunts, businesses or income streams then.

"
6541,21 may 2017,taurus,"With glamorous Venus in the most hush-hush part of your chart, it’s time to get a makeover going–on the sly. Listen, do all 537 of your Facebook friends need to know about the diet, exercise regimen or “tweaking” at the dermatologists’ office? Hell no! Besides, you should never underestimate how much fun it is to shock people with a brand new look and attitude.

6542,22 may 2017,taurus,"Who said that fantasies were a bad thing? Sometimes the word “fantasy” gets a bad rap as it conjures up images of unicorns and fairies and delusional people who think that their favorite movie star will appear on their doorstep and marry them. But today you can day dream your little heart out, and your ideas may actually have legs. With the new moon later this week in your practical, let’s-get-this-done house, a fantasy could become reality.

"
6543,23 may 2017,taurus,"Pushy, pushy! Aggressive Mars is waving a red flag at you, bull, and you may be way  too interested in getting things done pronto. Like: having that diamond ring slipped on your finger; landing that raise and the corner office; or losing weight and getting fit. Problem is, we all know what happens when we push too hard, too fast—mistakes get made, people around us become alienated, we spend cash we don’t have and maybe even injure our bodies. A Mars-Saturn opposition is responsible for this and it reaches critical mass next week. Slow your roll.

"
6544,24 may 2017,taurus,"Your passion to live a more interesting and fulfilling life is increasing, Taurus. You can make a lot of progress here as long as you keep it real and avoid airy-fairy thinking. Remember that you alone are responsible for creating a certain lifestyle, education, or mindset for yourself. If you place these things in the hands of others, waiting for them to fulfill your plans or agree with them, you might be waiting for a long time.

"
6545,25 may 2017,taurus,"Get ready for doors to open in your career, Taurus. Today’s new moon falls in your income sector, allowing you to track down a better paying gig or more income streams for your business. More responsibility may come your way which will build your self esteem. However, a strenuous Mars-Saturn opposition warns you to play it safe with any newfound cash. Don’t run up debt assuming that the bucks will be endlessly pouring in. Likewise, double check the terms of any employment or financial agreement. For example, if offered a new job that pays on a commission basis, crunch the numbers before you accept. Stern Saturn wants you to save.

"
6546,26 may 2017,taurus,"With love planet Venus in the most hidden part of your chart, you may be harboring hidden fantasies about someone. Likewise, you might be picturing a house with a white picket fence and two kids in the yard on swings. Or, you’re telling yourself that the problems in a union will miraculously work out. Get real, Taurus. Luckily some positive aspects over the weekend will help you understand your feelings better and enable you to work things out.

"
6547,27 may 2017,taurus,"You may be looking for ways to build a nicer nest egg, and if that’s the case you’re in luck. With profitable Venus in your house of intuition and hidden wisdom, the best way to hunt down bigger bucks is to go within. Meditate, keep a dream journal or tuck yourself away someplace quiet and ponder new ways to earn and save more. New millionaires are being minted every minute. Why not you?

"
6548,28 may 2017,taurus,"Family and friends can be the best source for advice and assistance these days, so be sure to reach out to them. While you’re in a practical mindset thanks to smart Mercury in Taurus, the people closest to you can open your mind to possibilities and solutions that you hadn’t considered before.

"
6549,29 may 2017,taurus,"Mars can act like a double edged sword in whatever house it happens to be in, and right now it’s in your house of earning, spending and saving money. You can either spend with abandon, assuming that the money will be there somehow when the credit card bill comes in, or you can become motivated to earn more and invest. A tough opposition from mature Saturn today strongly suggests that you follow the latter path.

"
6550,30 may 2017,taurus,"Some quiet reflection about where you’re headed with your career is advised thanks to Uranus firing up your subconscious mind. A sudden solution could hit you that could put more money in your pocket, or you may make a fast decision to leave your current job or even change careers. Tomorrow is an excellent day for researching and then strategizing your next move.

"
6551,31 may 2017,taurus,"Say what you mean and mean what you say! This is no time to hold back your opinions or bright ideas as a superb Mercury aspect encourages you to share your thoughts. People will be listening and will take note. This holds true for personal as well as professional endeavors.

"
6552,1 june 2017,taurus,"Sometimes we can feel tossed and turned by the circumstances in our lives: the things that other people do, the state of the economy, the political scene, our own health issues and so on. But today a structured, cathartic trine between Venus and Saturn allows you to feel as though you’re becoming the captain of your own ship. Your emotional state doesn’t have to be gyrating from moment to moment due to outside conditions. Take control.

"
6553,1 june 2016,taurus,"Be careful where you place your trust, Taurus! This affects your wallet more so than your heart, but both need to be considered. On the financial side, a Sun-Neptune square indicates that you could be asked to invest or spend money in some kind of group activity. Whether it’s a summer share at a beach house or a buddy’s new startup company, the aspects are not the best. On the romantic side, you may be demanding security and answers about long-term plans, but a lover may not be completely honest. Bide your time.

"
6554,2 june 2017,taurus,"The two most optimistic orbs in the solar system, Jupiter and the Sun, are in an awesome angle in houses that deal with making more money. Don’t be surprised if some new assignments or clients come your way that could pay off nicely down the road. But before you jump right in, ask yourself if you’re in the right line of work to begin with. If your job doesn’t stir your soul, it may be time for a change. Next week’s full moon is in your house of passive income, so you might want to consider starting a business on the side rather than changing occupations right now.

"
6555,2 june 2016,taurus,"The Moon is in your sign, Taurus, and it’s winking at amorous Neptune. Whether you’re single or attached, this is good news. A long cherished dream may come to fruition, whether it’s finding the right one, having baby or falling even deeper in love. It seems that you have waited a long time for this, maybe too long…and the cosmos is saying that it’s payback time.

"
6556,3 june 2017,taurus,"Your subconscious mind might be as active as a steaming volcano today, Taurus, thanks to a meeting of abrupt Uranus and Venus. This is good news if you’ve been trying to rid yourself of fears, depression or negative emotions that have plagued you for a long time. Should I even use the word “enlightenment”? It’s possible, and it will be swift in happening. But you could also stumble upon a secret that someone’s been keeping (good or bad). If someone close has been treating you poorly, you may decide that you’ve had enough and quickly make a break. This is all part of a healing process, so roll with it.

"
6557,3 june 2016,taurus,"It’s a good day to turn off your phone and take a short sabbatical from the human race, Taurus!  A Grand Cross in the heavens creates a kerfuffle among the people closest to you, primarily your pals and lover. No one will be able to agree on a course of action, and you’ll be caught in the middle. To top it off, finances get thrown into the mix. One minute you want to get married, the next minute the prospect of supporting a family frightens you. A buddy wants to borrow $1000, and you don’t want to lend it to him. Your lover wants more of a commitment, and you’re thinking you want more independence. There’s a strong security vibe running through this, which will intensify at the time of Sunday’s new moon.

"
6558,4 june 2017,taurus,"Your ability to get your point across skyrockets now that megamouth Mars is in your chatty third house! This is the place where we express ourselves, so get ready for some shameless self-promotion. (Just don’t get into everyone’s faces while you’re at it, a possibility with this placement.) The next few weeks are awesome too for brainstorming, holding meetings with like-minded people who share your vision, graphic arts projects, writing, producing videos, and sales and marketing. Getting to know the neighbors and clinking cocktail glasses with the tribe is also favored, so get out there and mingle.

"
6559,6 june 2017,taurus,"Damn, I look good! That will be your mantra over the next few weeks now that glam Venus is in your house of self image. And if you’re not happy with your appearance, physique or attitude it’s the perfect time to make a change. But you’ll still turn heads, babe, even if you think that you need to drop a few pounds.

"
6560,7 june 2017,taurus,"As Friday’s full moon approaches in your net worth sector, you should be going over your financial statements, figuring out how to pay down debt and considering new ways to increase your income and return on investments. Helping matters along in a big way is the fact that shrewd little Mercury enters the other money house, the place that allows you to really get into the nitty gritty details. Create a budget, slash expenses, and work on projects that will bring in more clients or promote your brand.

"
6561,8 june 2017,taurus,"Group endeavors seem to need a bit of adjustment, whether it’s at the office, your family unit, the tribe or a volunteer effort you’re involved in. Whether you like it or not, it’s time to step up and be the team’s cheerleader! Someone’s gotta get this group moving and with optimistic Jupiter in your house of efficiency, you’re the natural choice. This doesn’t mean that you should get saddled with all of the work, however. Motivate and then delegate.

"
6562,9 june 2017,taurus,"From your chart it appears that some serious decisions need to be made in love, as today’s full moon in Sagittarius is a turning point. Serious Saturn is close by, indicating that whatever you do will have significant long term consequences. This could be anything from breaking up to getting engaged. There’s an air of secrecy too, as if you deliberately keep the “news” from reaching the public, at least for awhile. With so many planets in practical houses, you’re going to want guarantees from love, not half-baked promises that aren’t very comforting.

"
6563,10 june 2017,taurus,"Phew. Gigantic Jupiter resumes direct motion in the most productive part of your chart, putting an end to overload at the office or at home, systems that aren’t working and people who may have been unreliable. Any confusion on your part as to which direction you should be heading in, especially in your career, should start to dissipate. Your previously frazzled state may have caused you to overlook details or the smartest and easiest ways to get things done. Now that the dust has settled you can approach tasks from a position of greater clarity—and optimism.

"
6564,11 june 2017,taurus,"Adventure is calling your name, but so is duty. You know: laundry, house cleaning, chauffeuring the kids around, catching up with work at the office. Tuesday is a much better day to tackle chores, so why not take the day off and play?

"
6565,12 june 2017,taurus,"The devil is in the details, Taurus! You may be really optimistic and ready to roll with a plan that floats your boat, but the planets recommend that you slow down and consider all of the moving pieces that will make it a success. If you push either the project or the people involved in it too hard, things could fall apart. Tomorrow is a much better day to get things in order.

"
6566,13 june 2017,taurus,"Today the cosmos brings some mixed vibes. You  are in an excellent position to knock out chores both at home and at work. You  can impress clients and land new assignments. You  know how to create and stick to a budget. Problem is, despite your best efforts, other people around you aren’t much interested in cooperating. Screw ‘em. Carpe diem. Do your best without their help.

"
6567,14 june 2017,taurus,"Laser like focus is needed when considering your big plans, but you’re in luck. Mature, logical Saturn is in the house that deals with research and probing, enabling you to get clear about the path ahead. One word of warning, however: Neptune will be retrograding on Friday in your house of teamwork. People will flake out, drop the ball or play games. It may be better to do your own thing for the rest of the year. There is no “I” in the word “team”? Too freakin’ bad.

"
6568,15 june 2017,taurus,"Stern Saturn tells you to take an in-depth look at your financial situation, Taurus. This is no time to take risks with your income, career or spending. If you’re looking for a new job or income stream, the good news is that your intuition is working overtime to help you find one. Go within and seek answers.

"
6569,16 june 2017,taurus,"The bull is known for being brave and fearless, but over the next few months you need to become more discrete. Neptune begins to backspin in your eleventh house of friends and networking, which includes business contacts. Reveal little and make sure that team members aren’t slacking. Since this sector also governs technology, it’s imperative to think before you hit the “send” button! Avoid rants, slanderous e-mails and trolling. It could come back to bite you in the tuckus.

"
6570,17 june 2017,taurus,"If you feel like an old friend is someone you knew in a past life, there may be something to it! The cosmos is telling you to stick to people who are true blue, the folks you can count on no matter what. Sometimes a small, close knit circle is more rewarding than a bevy of acquaintances.

"
6571,18 june 2017,taurus,"Sometimes half the battle is believing in yourself, even if deep down you have doubts about your abilities or future prospects. Uranus, the planet of genius thinking, is in one heck of a good mood today, urging you to take a chance on you.  Slow and steady will win this race so take it one day at a time.

"
6572,19 june 2017,taurus,"Your long term financial future is in the cosmos’s crosshairs today, so get ready to buckle down and analyze your statements and investments. Pay close attention to what your own inner wisdom advises you rather than the opinions of others who may not have a clue. Tomorrow is a good time to seek the advice of experts.

"
6573,20 june 2017,taurus,"Filters, please! Some of the stuff that goes on in your head should remain there, not to be released to the world. You’re entitled to a private life, something that you may forget over the next few weeks as the Sun enters the chattiest part of your chart. So go ahead and mingle with others, but keep some information to yourself.

"
6574,21 june 2017,taurus,"This is one of your best times all year to get together with other people and toss around ideas, shoot the breeze and enjoy their company. Both the Sun AND chatty Mercury enter your house of self-expression today, setting the stage for socializing and brainstorming. If you express yourself through the arts, this is one heck of a time to produce excellent work.

"
6575,22 june 2017,taurus,"No matter what you do for a living, you need to be able to express yourself well. The same goes for being a good parent, friend or lover. The next four weeks are superb for polishing up your communications skills, the written kind and the verbal. Heck, you may even consider teaching or going on the lecture circuit!

"
6576,23 june 2017,taurus,"Getting your point across should be easy today as the Moon conjuncts chatty Mercury. You’re currently in a very expansive mindset, thinking about possibilities that others around you may not be able to see. Give them some time to catch up to your level.

"
6577,24 june 2017,taurus,"While today’s new moon is falling in your house of local activities—meeting the neighbors, going to parties, signing up for an adult ed class—a happy Venus-Pluto aspect suggests having even more  fun abroad! So if you’ve been thinking about a long distance vacation, or even spending junior year in another country, now’s the time to start researching it.

"
6578,25 june 2017,taurus,"Take a time out from either a project or a problem that you’ve been attempting to wrap up. Aggressive Mars is stirring up your brain to the point where you’re overwhelmed or too caught up in minutiae. If you need to seek advice from a mentor or close confidante, do so: another person’s viewpoint could do the trick.

"
6579,26 june 2017,taurus,"Super schmooze! What a day to work a room and meet new people. Shop your resume, go to a singles get together, attend an industry event, or join a club. Not only will you make new contacts, but some of these people will inspire you in ways that you simply can’t imagine right now.

"
6580,26 june 2016,taurus,"Jupiter has been working double overtime in your romance department since last summer, trying to bring you happiness in love. Today it forms a rare and special angle with Pluto, something that you won’t see again until 2024! Both of these orbs are asking you to reconsider your attitude and values toward romance. It’s time to become more adventurous and take a few risks.

"
6581,27 june 2017,taurus,"With go-getter Mars and the Sun in your third house of thinking and planning you’re in a good spot for making progress in just about any area of your life. Inspirational Neptune will help you (and your team, if you have one) keep your eye on the prize–but you’ll need to check in daily to make sure that you’re on the right track.

"
6582,27 june 2016,taurus,"I love you to the moon and back. Words of love can finally flow as Mercury enters your communications sector and Mars resumes direct motion in your house of committed relationships. Better yet: an amorous trine between the two planets of love takes place today! Venus and Neptune hold a serious convo about the state of your union. Heads up, single people! You’re included. Get out there and mingle.

"
6583,28 june 2017,taurus,"Hands down, this is one of the best days in 2017 for you to express yourself. Mars and Mercury meet in your third house of communication, so start shouting from the mountaintop, my friend. Pitch a client or potential employer, make the big ask, propose marriage, ask someone out on a date or unleash the mother of all social media campaigns.

"
6584,28 june 2016,taurus,"Slow down, babe! The planets are telling you to cool your jets, especially where romance is concerned. It’s not that you’re on the wrong path; it’s more like you want things, and you want them now.  Weddings, babies, commitment, an answer of some kind, whatever it is, you’re ready to move on–and your partner may not be. Single bulls may be in too much of a rush to find someone and settle down. Chill.

"
6585,29 june 2017,taurus,"Feel like you’re talking to a wall? That might be the case with a Mercury-Pluto face off in the heavens. Someone may be hell bent on sticking to their opinion, unwilling to listen to sound advice. This dynamic could happen in a group as well. You’re coming from a smart place thanks to Mercury in your intellectual third house, but that doesn’t mean that others will recognize that your words are wise.

"
6586,29 june 2016,taurus,"You’re more than ready to close out past dramas, be they of a personal or financial manner. The full moon on the 20th was designed to help you rid yourself of toxic ties and worn-out stories that you’ve been telling yourself (not to mention the stories you hear from other people!).  Fortunately, a positive and powerful conjunction between the Moon and Uranus helps you put an end to at least one drama, enabling you to move on to a better place.

"
6587,30 june 2017,taurus,"There seems to be a disconnect between an ambitious plan that needs to get rolling and the actual means of getting it done. However, a snappy Moon-Jupiter connection today will put you in more a can-do attitude. Jupiter is the planet of abundance, so it will enable you to see possibilities instead of limitations.

"
6588,30 june 2016,taurus,"A battle of wills or words could erupt today, as Venus and Pluto stare each other down in the heavens. It’s critical to think before you speak, as Venus is in the most verbal part of your chart. However, even if you have honey dripping from your tongue, someone else may have acid dripping from theirs. It’s possible under current planetary aspects that they’re trying to protect their “turf”, however small and insignificant that might be! Let ’em keep it.

"
6589,1 july 2017,taurus,"Feeling fit and vibrant is a wonderful possibility, thanks to healing and optimistic Jupiter urging you to take better care of yourself. From your chart it appears that this might work better if you take the team approach, so: find an exercise buddy. Take a class at the gym instead of  jogging solo. Search out the expertise of a nutritionist or physical therapist if need be.

"
6590,2 july 2017,taurus,"Watch your tongue, toro! Blabbermouth Mars in your communication sector opposes Pluto, which could make you say the wrong thing at the wrong time to the wrong person. This is no time for making accusations or tossing around half-baked opinions. Say as little as possible, and make sure that whatever you say is objective.

"
6591,2 july 2016,taurus,"Catharsis. That’s what the planets have on offer for you as an extremely helpful angle occurs between the illuminating Sun and rational Saturn. Give a voice to your deepest emotions, even if you just scribble them down in a journal. The new moon on Monday will help you communicate necessary thoughts and emotions to the people in your world over the next few weeks, to your benefit and peace of mind.

"
6592,3 july 2017,taurus,"You may be in the mood for doing things your way, but a happy lunar aspect paves the way for successful partnering or socializing with others. Don’t worry, you won’t get tied down to other peoples’ expectations. With the upcoming full moon in your house of independent action, you’ll have plenty of freedom.

"
6593,3 july 2016,taurus,"Someone from your past may reappear on the scene, Taurus, and they may be interested in rekindling a relationship. Whether you want them back or not is another issue, but with so much positive planetary activity happening in your communication sector, you’ll be able to sort out your thoughts. A misunderstanding with a friend could also be resolved within the next few days.

"
6594,4 july 2017,taurus,"Now that romance planet Venus is in your house of stability you’ll be in no mood for a lover who won’t commit, nor sitting at home alone. It’s a good time to find someone new, a person with maturity and some financial cred. Happily involved? Then it’s time for some posher nights out on the town–no beer and pizza in front of the TV. Live a little!

"
6595,4 july 2016,taurus,"You may be feeling highly emotional these days, as a new moon in your house of thinking and expression is opening up your heart and mind. But there is so much support coming from other planets that this won’t be an unhappy event; on the contrary, it’s quite beneficial. The planet of logical thinking, Saturn, is in a fabulous angle, helping you release old emotions that are no longer serving you.

"
6596,5 july 2017,taurus,"Awesome day to showcase your talent or ideas to a willing audience. It could be your friends, the boss, your family, the news media, you name it–don’t hold back today. Just be aware that they will probably want to know the details, the nitty gritty about how you intend to get things done.

"
6597,5 july 2016,taurus,"If you’ve been considering doing something inspirational—starting or joining a charity, writing a book, helping a friend through a difficult time—this is a wonderful day to get started. Your ability to work with others and speak your truth are powerful, thanks to a happy Mercury-Neptune trine.

"
6598,6 july 2017,taurus,"OK Taurus, it’s time to stop talking  about living a healthy lifestyle and getting in shape, and time to start doing something about it. Abundant, healing Jupiter has been in your house of vitality since last fall and it will leave this October. Don’t let this fabulous opportunity go to waste. Start the diet and exercise regimen, set appointments with physicians and get more sleep. You have a busy time ahead and you need to be in top form.

"
6599,6 july 2016,taurus,"Things could start getting cozier at home with a warm Mars-Venus trine. From cohabitatiing with your amour to shopping for luxe throws and table ware, your home could finally start to feel like your castle. If you’re not happy with your current digs, roommate, or domestic situation, today is perfect for talking things over and finding solutions. Not to mention shopping!

"
6600,7 july 2017,taurus,"You can get your point across today in a practical yet loving manner. This is especially important at home or with a lover, as verbal Mercury is now in your house of domesticity and serenity. If boundaries need to be established, or “roles” (“it’s your job to clean out the litter box, honey”) by all means let people know what you expect.

"
6601,7 july 2016,taurus,"Your words carry weight and you can’t take them back. That is especially true today, as two oppositions and a square in your communication sector warn you to parse your words carefully. Things that you say could carry, meaning that others may read too much into them; they could be endlessly forwarded to others via e-mail; or they could become distorted. The smartest move is to act like a cloistered nun who has taken a vow of silence.

"
6602,8 july 2017,taurus,"Workshops, webinars, classes, lectures, mastermind groups–all of these may be on your agenda as a full moon takes place in the most mind expanding part of your chart. Whether you want to improve your tennis game, become a better parent or learn how to blog, the timing is perfect for seeking out knowledge. The more people you talk to, the more inspired you will become.

"
6603,8 july 2016,taurus,"Considering learning new skills? Then go online and see what’s on offer at the nearest college, trade school or adult ed program. With quick-witted Mercury in your education sector, you’ll be able to pick up new information quickly. Better yet is that profitable Jupiter is in a good angle, suggesting that you could earn more from your efforts.

"
6604,9 july 2017,taurus,"Your desire to learn more is high with planets in the houses that govern the taking in of information. You may feel like a great big sponge, soaking up knowledge, but even a sponge can reach a point where it can’t hold any more water! Give yourself time to absorb (no pun intended) what you’ve already learned before you take on more.

"
6605,9 july 2016,taurus,"Feeling flirty? You should be! The lovestruck Moon meets up with happy Jupiter in your romance sector, jazzing you up for some coquetry. Singles could meet a new flame, the stork may visit and attached bulls could share a tender moment. Hobbies and creative pursuits are also highly favored this weekend.

"
6606,10 july 2017,taurus,"Pick your battles wisely, Taurus. People around you may be critical or pushy, and chances are you may want to strike back. But is it worth it? Only you can decide. Besides, with the recent full moon in the most optimistic part of your chart, you may not really care all that much!

"
6607,10 july 2016,taurus,"If you love someone, let them know and let it show! With the Sun and Mercury in your candid third house, it’s time to let down any walls and start talking long term. Yes, I’m talking to you commitment-phobes, because these orbs are forming magnificent angles to Jupiter in the house of romance and Mars in the partnership area. It’s also a phenomenal day for singles to meet someone new, but honey, you’ve gotta advertise!

"
6608,11 july 2017,taurus,"Your desire to accomplish many tasks is admirable, Taurus, but you may end up overwhelmed and unable to complete them all. Furthermore, from your chart it appears that other people may not be willing to do their fair share, or they’ll oppose your ideas. Create a short list and dig in to it.

"
6609,11 july 2016,taurus,"It may suddenly occur to you today that someone around you is operating with a hidden agenda. Whether it’s a family member, frenemy, lover or colleague, your gut may tell you that everything is not what it appears to be. Should you talk it over? Chances are you won’t get the straight story. This energy continues into the weekend, so stay on your toes.

"
6610,12 july 2017,taurus,"It’s smart to seek the advice of a friend or a seasoned professional before you move ahead. The recent full moon has pushed you to take some calculated risks…but why put yourself out there without gaining the wisdom of people who know what to do next?

"
6611,12 july 2016,taurus,"Start trawling the lifestyle blogs, Taurus, because luxury-loving Venus is now in your domestic sector! If your place could use a facelift now is the time to call in the interior designers, painters and contractors. Venus can push you into posh, or bring out your inner no-frills feng shui. Your home should be your castle. Get thee to the store.

"
6612,13 july 2017,taurus,"With the passionate Moon connecting with amorous neptune, this can be quite a romantic day–and evening! make plans with your honey, and try something new considering that the full moon was in your house of living a more colorful life. Singles, both online dating or an intro from a pal are auspicious for meeting a new flame.

"
6613,13 july 2016,taurus,"Getting in touch with our emotions is not always an easy task, but now that intelligent Mercury is stationed in your fourth house of contentment and security, it should be. Over the next few weeks you should think about what it is that you need to make your life run more smoothly and happily. Then talk things over with the people in your life. With planet of ease Venus in the same part of the sky, you have a wonderful opportunity to create a more serene lifestyle.

"
6614,14 july 2017,taurus,"It’s time for the people around you to start working together as a team, whether it’s your family, friends or work colleagues. And you may have to be the person to get them there. Fortunately silver-tongued Mercury is in a good spot, shaking hands with optimistic Jupiter in your synergy sector. Take action today so that you can relax more next week.

"
6615,14 july 2016,taurus,"How we communicate with the people closest to us is of paramount importance. Today, you may be struck with a positive insight as to how to handle your romantic relationships (current or future) in a much more productive manner. You’re growing as a person, Taurus! Next week’s full moon will expand your mind and put you in a much more philosophical place.

"
6616,15 july 2017,taurus,"This is not a weekend for staying inside, unless that means attending a rager of a party. A happy Moon-Mars trine is telling you to gather the tribe and have a hell of a lot of fun. Besides, you never know whom you might meet (yes single people, I’m talking to you.)

"
6617,15 july 2016,taurus,"We’re all plagued by difficult emotions and memories, but today’s powerful Moon-Saturn conjunction allows you to release them. Now is the moment for a spiritual and emotional cleansing. Saturn will provide you with the tools to replace old negative patterns and replace them with happier ones that will stand the test of time.

"
6618,16 july 2017,taurus,"Your intuition will be running high today courtesy of a Moon-Uranus meet up. A sudden realization may hit you as Uranus is not only the planet of genius, but abrupt change. Don’t divulge any psychic hits that you receive, however, even to people who are close to you. Keep your cards close to your vest.

"
6619,16 july 2016,taurus,"This weekend is all about family and other people in your inner circle, Taurus. The Sun in your demonstrative third house urges you to connect with your loved ones and have a good old-fashioned talk,  which means: no e-mails, texting, or sitting in front of a TV or computer screen. That goes for your tribe as well as you! Trust me, your electronic devices will still be there on Monday.

"
6620,17 july 2017,taurus,"Your own logic and intuition are a far better source of understanding than the opinions of others, so don’t waste too much time listening to them. Furthermore, someone may be working their agenda, which naturally favors them instead of you. Remain vigilant and say little.

"
6621,17 july 2016,taurus,"Wanderlust alert! The Moon moves into the most adventurous part of your chart today, setting your thoughts on vacations, new sports you’d like to try, and even the kind of new people you’d like to meet! When La Luna becomes full on Tuesday in this sector, you may make the decision to start living a little bit more on the edge. And why not? Life’s too short to have regrets.

"
6622,18 july 2017,taurus,"Building better bonds is the name of the game with a fortuitous Venus-Jupiter trine. These are the two “benefics” of the solar system, the planets most willing to ease the path ahead and bring abundance. In your case they’ll help solidify your connections with others, which will lead to a sense of security on your part.

"
6623,18 july 2016,taurus,"There are people in our culture, past and present, whom we deem to be visionaries: Bill Gates, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Maria Montessori. But their ability to see the big picture isn’t a gift, it’s a skill that can be developed. And that’s what the planets are encouraging you to do today: think out of the box, reject small and petty attitudes (in yourself and others), and soar. Tomorrow’s full moon in the most adventurous part of your chart will open up the windows of your mind.

"
6624,19 july 2017,taurus,"This is no time to keep your feelings or opinions to yourself. A positive Mercury aspect encourages you to open up, even if you feel vulnerable in doing so. The long term benefits that you will derive from productive conversations may surprise you, so start talking!

"
6625,19 july 2016,taurus,"Moving out of your comfort zone isn’t always easy, but today’s full moon in the most expansive part of your chart will do wonders to boost your resolve. A positive angle between talkative Mercury and serious Saturn suggests that you have a heart to heart talk with a friend, family member, lover or trusted confidante about your innermost thoughts, the kind that might be holding you back. Fear, worry, lack of confidence…banish them. When the Sun moves into Leo this Friday your faith in yourself will only increase.

"
6626,20 july 2017,taurus,"Family and housing matters start to heat up now that Mars is in this part of your chart. Mars is like a two-edged sword: it can stir up way too much drama, or cut problems quickly so that you can make real progress. The choice is yours.

"
6627,20 july 2016,taurus,"You’re a grounded person by nature, Taurus, and current planetary influences are trying to bring more peace and stability to your home base. A marvelous Venus-Saturn trine allows you to smooth over family or residential dramas so that you can move on to greater contentment. You may be the one extending the olive branch and playing the role of consigliere, but isn’t greater serenity worth it?

"
6628,21 july 2017,taurus,"Snark alert! Someone seems bound and determined to play games with you today, knowing just what to say to push you over the edge. Whether it’s an all-out assault or a passive-aggressive technique, you have a choice here: to react and respond, or just to let it go.

"
6629,21 july 2016,taurus,"In order to reach the top you’re going to have to change your methods somewhat. Having goals and a game plan aren’t enough under current planetary influences. Just how creative is your process? Doing things the same old way will produce the same old results.

"
6630,22 july 2017,taurus,"It’s been a bumpy few weeks with people acting up, perhaps trying to throw you off your game, but now that the Sun is in Leo they won’t succeed. This is your fourth house of comfort and security, the place where we reach an inner peace that others can’t mess with.

"
6631,22 july 2016,taurus,"Now that the Sun is in Leo, you’ll be focused on living a fuller life with more contentment and ease. Start with your home base. Is it a chaotic mess? Are family members sullen, or at each other’s throats? Do the furnishings reflect who you really are? If not, it’s time to bring beauty, comfort and peace back into your life, whatever it takes.

"
6632,23 july 2017,taurus,"A happier period in your home life begins with a new moon in Leo. That is, if you’re willing to accept happiness! The issue is that erratic Uranus is acting up in the subconscious mind sector, stirring up past grudges and dramas that may have occurred with a lover or family member. Want peace? Then let it go.

"
6633,23 july 2016,taurus,"It’s tribe time. With the Moon in your friendship sector forming a terrific angle with Neptune, you can not only enjoy the company of friends, but comfort as well. Get things off your chest with the people who understand you the best. With the Sun now in your domestic sector, a quiet evening at home with pals is in the stars.

"
6634,24 july 2017,taurus,"Don’t be so hard on yourself, Taurus! A Venus-Saturn opposition indicates that you’re being way too self critical at a time when you should be healing your psyche and pampering yourself. Drop some of the rules and regulations that you’ve imposed on your life.

"
6635,24 july 2016,taurus,"In Taoism, the “empty mind” is prized, which essentially means a mind free of worry and anxiety. A nurturing Moon-Sun angle helps shed light on the parts of your psyche that are causing unrest. Contentment can  by yours; empty out the “trash” in your subconscious first!

"
6636,25 july 2017,taurus,"Hey there, foxy. Mercury has just entered your romance sector, enabling you to get flirty–and maybe a little bit dirty! Seriously, you can charm just about anyone these days, so use this suave and creative energy to make connections with people in all walks of life.

"
6637,25 july 2016,taurus,"Risky business! Pluto is currently in the most adventurous part of your chart, pushing you out of your comfort zone into a bolder place. So why are you holding back? The emotional Moon in your house of the subconscious mind is dredging up fears and concerns. Slow down and relax. When the Moon enters Taurus tomorrow clarity will return.

"
6638,26 july 2017,taurus,"Fabulous day for creating emotional security, whatever that means to you: getting engaged, settling a family quarrel, starting a mindfulness or gratitude practice, finding out that someone loves you back. You may need to take the lead but the results will be worth it.

"
6639,26 july 2016,taurus,"With the Moon in your sign forming a happy trine with Pluto, you may feel compelled to stretch a bit out of your comfort zone. And why not? Life is too short to do things the same old way. Travel, study, appreciating art and other cultures-these are the best ways to grow right now.

"
6640,27 july 2017,taurus,"When it comes to the nuts and bolts of our daily lives, we can either be way behind on our chores, barely caught up with them or–better yet–nicely ahead. Now that the Moon is in your efficiency sector, why not try to hustle and blast though your list? Greater serenity lies ahead, a sweet bonus.

"
6641,27 july 2016,taurus,"You’ve been experiencing some intense emotions as of late, but today provides you with a welcome–even surprising–patch of peace of mind. Not only that, you’re ready to nurture your mind with positive treatment, such as going for a walk in nature, or meditating, rather than the usual stuff–junk food, a few drinks, trawling the web. Keep up the healing energy.

"
6642,28 july 2017,taurus,"Somehow the trolls and the malcontents won’t annoy you as much today–could be due to optimistic Jupiter in a good position! Yup, you’re just going to charge forward with your day’s activities, humming a happy tune. Contentment is something you can get used to!

"
6643,29 july 2017,taurus,"Your body language can say just as much about you as your words, so if you want to control your “message” be aware of both. Don’t give away too much information via subtle clues hidden in your gestures or facial expressions.

"
6644,29 july 2016,taurus,"Uranus starts its annual backstroke session through the house of your subconscious mind, creating ripples in its wake. This is the planet of genius and rebellion, but it can be erratic. Pay close attention to your gut hunches and dreams as they can be downright psychic. But before you act upon a hunch, use logic and rational thought to guide your actions.

"
6645,30 july 2017,taurus,"Security can actually be sexy! Singles, keep your mind open to the “quiet” types–there could be a lot more steamy stuff going on beneath the surface. And for those of you already attached, this is a good day for spending some secluded hours with each other.

"
6646,30 july 2016,taurus,"What do you want out of a romance? With whip-smart Mercury heading into your love sector, you’ll be able to elucidate your needs without delusion. True, deceptive Neptune is in your house of big dreams, but if you’ve been kidding yourself about a partner, Mercury will clear the fog. The next few weeks are excellent for talking things over with your amour, and kids as well.

"
6647,31 july 2017,taurus,"Your sign likes feeling grounded, and now that Venus is in Cancer you should be able to develop more stability, especially on the home and romantic fronts. You may have to take the lead when it comes to initiating conversations with loved ones, but the end result–greater contentment–will be worth it.

"
6648,31 july 2016,taurus,"We all have big plans and dreams, but today you’re advised to keep them under wraps. Verbalizing them could stir up resistance from the people closest to you, who may not be on board with your ideas–yet. The good news is that Neptune, the planet of inspiration, is in a good angle, indicating that your goals are coming from a pure place.

"
6649,1 august 2017,taurus,"The opportunity to make more money is on the table, and the best way to go about it is to be as amiable as possible with people who can help you. Pull people onto your team and strategize as a group rather than going this alone. Aggression or fast starts won’t work: take your time and make wise decisions.

"
6650,1 august 2016,taurus,"With Venus and the Sun so active in your family sector, it would be wise to set aside some quality time to spend with loved ones–or just yourself. Recharge your batteries by cocooning with a good book and a glass of wine. And while you’re at it, take a look around–is there a room that could use some redecorating? Tomorrow’s new moon is going to make you a lot more interested in turning your home into a castle.

"
6651,2 august 2017,taurus,"Long term financial and romantic plans are under a microscope today, but that’s a good thing! You’ll be able to assess the direction you should be heading in, which is important as next week’s lunar eclipse falls in your house of big dreams and goals.

"
6652,2 august 2016,taurus,"Ggrrrr! Hey there, tiger.  Mars enters your house of intimacy and libido for a nice long, sultry stay. With a new moon occurring at the same time in your cocooning-at-home sector, chances are you’ll be more interested in cuddling chez vous  rather than hitting the scene. So while PDAs may not be on the menu, watch out for dramas behind closed doors. Mars can stir up jealousy and mistrust: mix logic with your lust.

"
6653,3 august 2017,taurus,"Say “adios” to problematic people and situations. Brilliant Uranus is now retrograding through your house of closure and transition, pointing out the areas of your life that needs to be revised. Between now and early January you will be cutting a lot of unnecessary cords. Buh-bye!

"
6654,3 august 2016,taurus,"Impulsive Uranus may be making you anxious to resolve a family or romantic situation, and indeed the aspects for doing so are excellent. But while you want to get things out in the open, don’t push others too hard to make a decision, especially about long-term plans. They’ll come around over the next few weeks. Give them time.

"
6655,4 august 2017,taurus,"Power struggles could erupt at the office with people trying to grab credit, gain control or push a project ahead faster than it should move. At the same time others may be nitpicking and dragging their feet. With next week’s full moon occurring in your house of ambition and success, you’ll have no trouble getting this situation back in line.

"
6656,4 august 2016,taurus,"Someone’s going to be feeling flirty and amorous over the next few weeks, and it’s the sign of the bull. But you have to be careful who the target of your attention is. Under the current planetary aspects, even the most innocent remark could be misconstrued by someone. Think before your speak…or wink.

"
6657,5 august 2017,taurus,"A friend may be in need of comfort and assurances that things will work out, and you may be the light to guide them. With the Sun in Leo, you’ll be able to strike just the right note of compassion and authority.

"
6658,5 august 2016,taurus,"While Venus enters your house of romance today for a three-week visit, you’re being warned by the cosmos to think not only with your heart, but with your head. The issue is that your passions may rise to the point where you’re guided more by lust or fantasy than common sense. And just because your friends may all be coupled up doesn’t mean that you should rush into a relationship. Take your time, Taurus.

"
6659,6 august 2017,taurus,"Bright ideas may be bubbling through your mind….but how the heck to execute them? With the passionate Moon boxed in by other orbs, the answer may not be clear today. But it will be by the time of Monday’s lunar eclipse.

"
6660,6 august 2016,taurus,"Got something to say to your sweetheart? Can it wait? Because this weekend has some tense vibes, especially when it comes to holding serious discussions. Your best bet is to keep it light: take in a movie, make a date a group event with close friends invited along, or head to the beach for some fun in the sun. Hold off on convos til next Wednesday, a far more opportune time to chat.

"
6661,7 august 2017,taurus,"Yasss!! A lunar eclipse in your goals sector could bring a deeply held wish to a stunning conclusion, if not this week then over the next six months. This is especially true in both your career, family and fitness plans. The good thing is that you may finally be able to balance the demands of a busy job with your personal life, so make this a priority.

"
6662,7 august 2016,taurus,"We live in an Instagram world in which so often it appears that everyone else is living the good life. Fear of missing out could lead us to covet things or people that may not be the best for us, however. A tense opposition today between Mercury and Neptune could make you pine for a fantasy life that really wouldn’t make you happy, even if it did come true. Keep it real and count your blessings.

"
6663,8 august 2017,taurus,"The eclipse yesterday in your goals and career sector has opened up an auspicious six-month period in which you can make enormous progress. Today a hush-hush Moon-Uranus aspect suggests that you tuck yourself away for a quiet strategy session. A bright idea may appear out of the blue–pay attention to it!

"
6664,8 august 2016,taurus,"How well you work as a member of a team is in the planets’ crosshairs today, Taurus! Yes, you may have dealt with troublesome co-workers and romantic partners in the past, but in order to  move forward you’ll need to switch up the way you view them. This isn’t some kind of “kumbayah/everyone is beautiful/surround yourself with white light” nonsense, but a practical approach. Let their s*** be their s*** as you go about your day.

"
6665,9 august 2017,taurus,"You may be tempted to take a risk with powerful Pluto encouraging you to push up against previous boundaries. Fortunately, the Sun links with Pluto in such a way that you can consider making changes intelligently without a lot of undue risk.

"
6666,9 august 2016,taurus,"You’re getting tired of living a life that feels hemmed in by budget constraints and old dramas. Fortunately, the cosmos is serving up a delicious trine tomorrow, but you should start to feel its energy today. The idea of taking a chance in love or business is becoming less of a fantasy and looking like more of a reality. When Saturn goes direct this weekend, the resources you need to make progress will start to manifest.

"
6667,10 august 2017,taurus,"You’ll be highly motivated to get things on an even keel with everyone in your world: kids, family, co-workers and your lover. With lovely, gentle Venus in your house of communication, you’ll be able to catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. No need for drama or ultimatums.

"
6668,10 august 2016,taurus,"If you want a project to move ahead, you’re in an excellent position to persuade someone. Expansive Mercury in the most creative part of your chart will help you paint the right kind of imagery with your words. This energy will last for several days so take advantage of it. Partnerships and alliances are especially favored.

"
6669,11 august 2017,taurus,"Careful, El Toro! Mercury begins to retrograde manana in your romance sector through the 31st. A harsh opposition to Neptune demands that you find out for sure whether a lover is on the same page as you when it comes to long term plans, and that includes those of you who are single and looking. Don’t sell out just to have a Saturday night date.

"
6670,11 august 2016,taurus,"You may conflicted about a course of action, Taurus. Assertive Mars is telling you to go for it while stern Saturn is warning you to step on the brakes. Adding fuel to this fire is the emotional Moon gliding past both of these orbs in the heavens today. Wait until the weekend, at which time Saturn goes direct. The answers may not come quickly but there will be more clarity for you.

"
6671,12 august 2017,taurus,"Despite the fact that Mercury has just retrograded in your romance sector, this weekend is quite amorous with a Venus-Neptune trine. This is an excellent time to work things out with calm, sensible discussions, not to mention enjoying dinner in a cozy cafe. Singles definitely should attend parties or events where people gather as this is an auspicious time for meeting someone new.

"
6672,12 august 2016,taurus,"Trust your gut when it comes to vetting the people around you, as the planets are casting a stern eye toward lovers and friends. It’s possible that you just need to take a little alone time away from the tribe to get in touch with your emotions and relax a bit. But if a relationship with someone has become more trouble than it’s worth, it may be time to move on.

"
6673,13 august 2017,taurus,"This is no time to hide in the shadows when it comes to love or family matters! On the contrary. A Sun-Saturn trine bodes well for creating structure and figuring out what lies ahead: a pregnancy, getting engaged or helping your parents out.

"
6674,13 august 2016,taurus,"The clouds part as Saturn resumes direct motion in one of the most emotional areas of your chart. The past five months may have been onerous as you questioned a romantic relationship, or were beset by financial burdens. Court awards, child support, commission monies and inheritances may have been stalled. Hallelujah, the ringed planet starts to pull you out of this funk. Serious decisions about where you’re headed, both in love and business, can now be made.

"
6675,14 august 2017,taurus,"With the passionate Moon in your sign, you’re willing to speak up about the way you feel, especially when it comes to showing affection! Don’t hide your love for your family, kids, lover or even your pets. It’s also an auspicious time for showcasing your ideas at the office, as profitable Venus has your back.

"
6676,14 august 2016,taurus,"Having fun is definitely on the planets’ agenda for you, as three planets–Mercury, Venus and Jupiter–are all parked in your house of entertainment, love, sports and culture. But relationships with friends could get a bit dicey today and into early next week as watery Neptune swirls its mist. If you need to take a little time out, do so. You don’t want to be influenced by their opinions right now, even if they have your own best interests at heart. Be your own judge.

"
6677,15 august 2017,taurus,"The critics are out today in full force, so don’t fall prey to worrying about what others say to you. And make sure that you’re not doling out opinions that someone else won’t appreciate. The air clears on Friday.

"
6678,15 august 2016,taurus,"Take a chance on a creative new idea or plan! The passionate Moon conjuncts Pluto, the great transformer. They’ll boost your optimism and desire to go for something that you haven’t tried before. With Mercury in a terrific angle from your cutting-edge thinking sector, your ideas will be way ahead of the crowd.

"
6679,16 august 2017,taurus,"Pay more attention to what a lover or family member has to say than a friend, Taurus. Likewise, start focusing more on your family than your pals. Murky Neptune in your friendship sector warns that not all of your “buddies” have your back.

"
6680,16 august 2016,taurus,"It’s nice to have a lovely looking home, but a gorgeous interior setting that looks like it came from a design magazine isn’t worth it if you’re not truly enjoying the space. Home is more than a place to sleep and eat–it can be your workshop. Start setting aside more time for cooking, gardening, sewing, woodwork; whatever kind of hobby that fills you up with contentment and makes you smile.

"
6681,17 august 2016,taurus,"Take the time to have a heartfelt talk with someone today, as it will only strengthen your relationship. A beautiful Venus-Pluto trine enables walls to come down and a true exchange of opinions and emotions. In matters of the heart, you and a lover may now be able to plan the next big step.

"
6682,18 august 2017,taurus,"You can get your point across today with passion, so speak out! Whether you’re trying to make a major sales presentation or work things out with a lover, the lines of communication are definitely open. Tomorrow is a better time for reflection, so don’t waste today’s energy.

"
6683,18 august 2016,taurus,"Take a bow, Taurus. Today’s full moon falls in your house of achievement and success. Something that you’ve been working on may finally come to a fabulous close. But even if you haven’t been pushing hard to reach new goals, this lunation will give you the drive to go after them. When the Sun enters Virgo next week your creative mojo will soar, so take advantage of the good energy on offer.

"
6684,19 august 2017,taurus,"Be guarded with your opinions and words as erratic Uranus could prompt you to say things that need to be kept below the radar for now. Just because you think it doesn’t mean that you should say it. Wait until Sunday if you need to get something out in the open.

"
6685,19 august 2016,taurus,"You’re coming into your own, Taurus. Yesterday’s full moon is pushing you to seize the reins in life rather than letting others call the shots. You may be tested today by someone who is determined to maintain their “power position”, but hold your ground. With Neptune prominent, you don’t need to be aggressive or loud–silence rules. Let the other person figure it out for themselves.

"
6686,20 august 2016,taurus,"With so much planetary energy taking place in your fifth house of fun, creativity and romance, this is a perfect weekend to get outside and enjoy what’s on offer: street fairs, the park, a bike ride, art galleries, or a tucked-away little cafe. And don’t feel guilty about it either! Others may be making demands on your time, but you need some down time for yourself.

"
6687,21 august 2016,taurus,"The planets are encouraging you to seek emotional balance. Issues such as mistrust, fear, jealousy, resentment or even obsession need to be moderated or subdued with a healthy dose of logical thinking. Today a positive trine between the Moon, Mars and Saturn sets you on the right path to serenity and a more objective viewpoint. This energy will build as the week progresses, with Wednesday being a breakthrough day.

"
6688,22 august 2016,taurus,"A sizzling set of aspects puts you in the driver’s seat for an enjoyable month ahead, Taurus! First, the Sun moves into Virgo today, your fifth house of fun and romance. It joins three other planets, so the message from the cosmos is loud and clear: carpe diem, baby! Clear the deck of extraneous duties or obligations and seek more love and excitement in your life. Intelligent Mercury also meets up with Jupiter in the same part of the sky, allowing your creative juices to flow.

"
6689,23 august 2016,taurus,"Whom you connect with on a regular basis is under review by the cosmos, Taurus. A wonky aspect tomorrow between Mars and Saturn simultaneously urges you to move forward with an alliance, yet slam on the brakes. Take some time out to analyze your feelings about another person, whether it’s a lover, friend or business partner. If emotions such as anger or resentment bubble to the surface, ask yourself why you feel this way–and then determine to fix the problem.

"
6690,24 august 2016,taurus,"“Don’t be so emo!” may be a phrase that gets tossed around a lot, but getting in touch with your emotions is important today. Both Mars and Saturn are in your house of psychological depth and intimacy, forcing you to examine the feelings that lie deep beneath the surface. Hot-blooded Mars may make you anxious to move forward in a romance (lust! sex!), but cautious Saturn warns you to slow down. Even if the issue at hand is not about love, getting to the bottom of things that have been bothering you is critical if you’re going to move forward.

"
6691,25 august 2016,taurus,"A super conjunction yesterday between Mars and Saturn can help take your financial portfolio to a much higher level, but first you may need to tighten your belt. The emotional Moon in your house of income and spending is urging you to be realistic as to what your dreams will cost, whether it’s a house, retirement, or adding to your family. Joint finances can be a sticky wicket today–make sure you’re on the same page when it comes to fiscal choices.

"
6692,27 august 2016,taurus,"One of the luckiest days all year for love! Bulls are blessed by the cosmos as love planet Venus meets up with abundant Jupiter today in your house of romance. New flames could be kindled while existing ones burn ever brighter. Since this is also the sector that governs children, a baby could be conceived, in addition to simply having an awesome day with the little ones. If love has been elusive, know that a solar eclipse is scheduled to take place in this part of the sky on September 1st.

"
6693,28 august 2016,taurus,"With so many planets piled into your house of fun and socializing, you must  make plans with others and enjoy the planetary energy on offer. But a square between the Moon and Uranus could create mixed lines of communication between you and someone close. With the Moon in your candid third house you may be tempted to blurt out your thoughts. Think before your speak, which includes posting online.

"
6694,29 august 2016,taurus,"Romantic relationships are going to be all over the map this week. A happy Mercury-Venus convo today is super for discussing where things are going and expressing your feelings. But tomorrow Mercury goes retro in this part of your chart, stirring up past issues, and then there’s a solar eclipse on Thursday here too. Put on your seatbelt.

"
6695,30 august 2016,taurus,"You’ve heard about “revenge bodies”, right?  It’s when someone gets into awesome shape just to make their ex miserable. Well, Taurus, it’s your turn for some sweet revenge. Gorgeous Venus just entered your house of fitness, helping you create a masterpiece of fitness and vitality out of your body. And what do you know, Mercury retrogrades in your romance house, possibly bringing an ex back into your life. This is also a good time to work on creative projects and get them ready for showtime.

"
6696,31 august 2016,taurus,"A quirky mix of planetary aspects may find you questioning the state of a romantic liaison. Should you stay or should you go? If you’re happy in love, are you ready for the next step that your partner is expecting? Should you speak up about issues or keep them to yourself for now? Things will become clearer at the time of tomorrow’s eclipse.

"
6697,1 september 2016,taurus,"Your creative mojo goes off the charts with today’s solar eclipse in the most inventive part of your chart. Get ready to impress others with your skills and talent, although with Neptune in a cranky spot, there may be a few haters out there. But what do you care? This lunation can also bring in new love or take an existing relationship to the next step, and quickly at that.

6698,2 september 2016,taurus,"With chatty and candid Mercury winking at optimistic and happy-go-lucky Jupiter in your house of love, it will be hard to hold back your feelings! So if you’re lusting after a married co-worker, you better put a filter on that mouth of yours. But if you want to tell a viable prospect or current amour how much you love them, this is a banner day to do so.

"
6699,3 september 2016,taurus,"Yum! Clear your schedule for fun, sports, cultural events and romance as the Moon swings past Venus and Jupiter in your frisky fifth house. The laundry can wait, along with cleaning the toilets and dealing with cranky relatives. Get outside, call some friends, and plan a juicy weekend.

"
6700,4 september 2016,taurus,"It’s a holiday weekend in the US, but you may be so tuckered out from the stress at the office and just trying to keep up with your errands that you can’t see the big picture: the happier, more adventurous side of life. Don’t worry. Generous Jupiter is just about ready to enter your house of efficiency this Friday, helping you come up with tricks and hacks that will enable you to get more done in less time, resulting in greater serenity.

"
6701,5 september 2016,taurus,"Burning the candle at both ends? Then it’s time for a reality check! A strong moon-Uranus opposition suggests that you’ve been taking on too much at the office as well as at home. Planetary influences are firing you up to get organized and become more efficient, but there’s only so much you can accomplish in a day. Slow down, take better care of your health and create a more realistic timetable for getting things done.

"
6702,6 september 2016,taurus,"You’re about to enter a highly effective time period in which you’ll be able to cut through tasks like a hot knife through butter. Jupiter’s entry on Friday into your orderly, practical sixth house will help transform your life into a less stressed experience. But you won’t be doing this alone. With the Moon currently in your partnership sector and the Sun in your house of romance, it would be wise to involve the other people in your circle in your strategy to live a more streamlined, simplified life.

"
6703,7 september 2016,taurus,"Work and leisure are both calling your name, Taurus, as a bevy of planets are in a helpful mood. Venus encourages you to streamline your daily routine, as it will help put more money in the bank. Whether you become a savvier shopper for your family or your efficiency dazzles the boss, it’s all good. And a happy Sun-Pluto connection wants you to balance your daily grind with a big helping of fun, relaxation, travel and culture. Nice!

"
6704,8 september 2016,taurus,"This could be an emotional day as the Moon stirs up old feelings and emotions in one of the most sensitive parts of your chart. However, this is beneficial as it will help you release things that should have been tossed quite some time ago. A happy side effect is that your vitality and health should get a boost, thanks to Venus in your house of glowing health.

"
6705,9 september 2016,taurus,"As precise as a Swiss clock! That’s going to be you  this year, Taurus, thanks to powerful Jupiter entering your house of efficiency and streamlining for the first time since 2005. From your house to the office, you will be on top of chores and impressing bosses and clients with your can-do attitude. This is also an amazing year to get fit and banish chronic aches and pains that have been plaguing you. Just watch the tendency to go overboard with a new fitness regimen, as Jupiter can make us a tad over-optimistic.

"
6706,10 september 2016,taurus,"Your deepest thoughts and emotions should stay in the depths today, Taurus! A strong Saturn-Neptune square advises against sharing confidential thoughts with a person who will make them go viral in your circle. Be cautious when dealing with other members of a team or group you’re associated with, as they may not be trustworthy. Making big plans with a mate? Ensure that they’re on the same page as you, and not just telling you what they think you want to hear.

"
6707,11 september 2016,taurus,"Time for a little assessment. A square between Venus and Pluto indicates that you need to take a time out: in romance, work, health, or other big plans for the future. Sometimes we’re so busy trekking along on our path that we don’t stop to determine just how our progress is going. Being busy doesn’t mean that you’re progressing. Take a few minutes to check.

"
6708,12 september 2016,taurus,"Take what you hear with a grain of salt, Taurus. A Venus-Pluto aspect indicates that someone could be trying to butter you up. This vibe continues into the week, so don’t let up your guard. Likewise, someone may not be expressing their true feelings. This energy changes by Saturday, a much better time for getting down to the truth.

"
6709,13 september 2016,taurus,"Planetary influences this week may find you torn between following your own instincts or those of the herd. Lovers, friends, family members, team mates–they could all be putting in their two cents’ worth. In the meantime, Mars is stirring up your own deep thoughts about matters, which may be quite different than those of your circle. To thine own self be true.

"
6710,15 september 2016,taurus,"That’s what friends are for! That old saying is on point today as a number of planets are encouraging you to reach out to a trusted pal or confidante. If you need to get something off your chest, or want to get the opinion of someone you trust, do so. Don’t go it alone.

"
6711,16 september 2016,taurus,"Between now and February, the people in your orbit will play big part in your future happiness and success. That’s due to the lunar eclipse occurring in your eleventh house of teamwork, friends and camaraderie. You may decide to cut ties with people whose loyalty you question, but exciting new friendships can be made. This is also the house of technology, so online ventures, such as launching a website or an app, ought to take off like a rocket.

"
6712,17 september 2016,taurus,"Hmmm. Mars in your house of sexuality is forming an amazing link to spontaneous Uranus in the house of seclusion! Do I see bodice-ripping sex in your boudoir? That’s a possibility, along with mega-flirtation in public, sexting away on your smart phone, and lusting after that hottie who’s caught your eye. My, my Taurus, what a steamy day you have!

"
6713,18 september 2016,taurus,"You may experience an “aha!” moment (or hear a juicy secret) when it comes to the people you deal with on a daily basis, such as work colleagues or someone at the gym or in the car pool. It could hit you like a tornado, but the smart Taurus keeps their mouth shut. A tough opposition between Venus and Uranus warns to let sleeping dogs lie.

"
6714,19 september 2016,taurus,"Healthy is sexy. Healthy is also confident, which makes you even more charismatic! A super angle today between Venus and Mars will encourage you to improve your vitality. Do it for yourself, your lover (or a future one), and your family.

"
6715,20 september 2016,taurus,"Pluto in the most expansive part of your chart is changing your philosophy of life in a big way. The good news is that you’re developing a bigger and broader view: of love, family life, career, travel and overall lifestyle. Today and Friday Mercury forms a glorious trine with Pluto, adding a dash of creativity to your plans. This entire week is wonderful for brainstorming and day dreaming.

"
6716,22 september 2016,taurus,"A lean, mean machine. That’s what you’re going to become, Taurus, not only with your physique but also at home and work. That’s because the Sun has just entered your sixth house of fitness, health, organizing and streamlining. Helpful Jupiter just went there on the 9th, so with two power players like this in da house, you can’t go wrong. You’ll be beyond  motivated.

"
6717,23 september 2016,taurus,"People around you may be over-optimistic about what can be achieved in a certain amount of time.  Whether it’s your kids, spouse, boss, personal trainer or co-workers, you may need to be the voice of reason today. It may take until next week for them to realize that you’re right! Better late than never.

"
6718,24 september 2016,taurus,"A helpful aspect between Mercury and Pluto will allow you to hold meaningful, productive conversations with your kids or a lover.  From your chart it appears that you need to take control of a situation that has long-term ramifications. Just watch out for coming on too strong or being way too emotional, a possibility with the Moon opposing Pluto.

"
6719,25 september 2016,taurus,"You’re quite focused on a project or course of action, and your determination will only grow in the weeks and months ahead. You’re thinking more long-term and may be reconsidering your path: the best way to move forward on it. With assertive Mars entering Capricorn on Tuesday, others may deem your ideas too lofty or unachievable. Prove them wrong!

"
6720,26 september 2016,taurus,"A superb Sun-Jupiter meeting could bring you the career advancement you’ve been looking for. It could come in the form of a job offer, but there are other ways to become successful: hiring the right staff, employing new technology that makes you more efficient, or streamlining your operations. Your vitality can also soar as a new chapter opens, helping you heal past maladies while you get toned.

"
6721,27 september 2016,taurus,"It’s all systems go as Mars powers its way into your house of adventure, travel, and study. Pluto just went direct here yesterday, so any roadblocks that were holding up big plans should be removed. Sometimes the “roadblocks” are in our minds, and Pluto’s retro spin was designed to have you analyze the areas where you might have been fearful or unsure of yourself. Now Mars will provide you with the ambition to get things done.

"
6722,28 september 2016,taurus,"It’s important to ensure that you and a romantic partner are on the same page, especially when it comes to long-term goals and values. From the current planetary lineup it appears that you may be racing far ahead of your amour—and they may be telling you what they think you want to hear.  Singles could also be too anxious to land a lover and turn them into a spouse. Slow down!

"
6723,29 september 2016,taurus,"A sudden realization may hit you about a romantic situation that needs to be addressed. The Moon is in your vibey twelfth house, helping you assess your life with wisdom that comes from other realms. Even if you’re single you may come to a quick decision about what you want from a future partner. Parents could also intuit what’s going in their kids’ heads, especially helpful if you have teenagers!

"
6724,30 september 2016,taurus,"A lucky meeting between Jupiter and the Moon raises your prospects at the office, so don’t be shy today about promoting your talents. Stay-at-home moms and dads can also benefit from this energy as it can help you land a better babysitter, find play dates for your kids, make your food shopping easier or just streamline your chores.

"
6725,1 october 2016,taurus,"Over the next few months you can make awesome progress at work or at home, dazzling others with your efficiency. A new moon in your productive sixth house sets the stage for a new era of organization and streamlining. If you live with a romantic partner, a pleasant Venus-Neptune trine will help you divide up your household chores in an equitable manner. In business you may discover that taking on a partner or an agent to represent you is the best way to get through your daily grind, as it will free up time and much-needed energy.

"
6726,2 october 2016,taurus,"Life is too short to waste on people and situations that don’t support you. Maybe you feel duty bound to remain in these relationships, or that some kind of crazy karma is at work. But that’s not the case. Pluto asks you to consider whether these factors are holding you back in any way, and if that’s the case, it’s time to move on.

"
6727,3 october 2016,taurus,"If you’re trying to figure out what makes another person tick, today’s planetary aspects could provide some insight. Nurturing Venus forms a positive angle to subterranean Pluto, the planet that points out the inner workings of someone’s mind. This doesn’t mean that you’ll like what you see, but at least you can gain some understanding.

"
6728,4 october 2016,taurus,"You’re in an excellent position to make big strides in creating more wealth today, courtesy of a Sun-Saturn trine. Whether you start your own business, invest in someone else’s, start an IRA, go after your ex for past due child support, refinance your mortgage, patent an invention or consider a joint venture with someone, Saturn has your back. The Sun points out the possibilities; Saturn helps you think logically and long term.

"
6729,5 october 2016,taurus,"You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar, the old saying goes, and truer words were never spoken! With magnetic Venus in your house of partners it will be far easier to convince a lover or business connection that your opinions or needs are worthwhile and should be considered. A more adventurous, free-thinking approach is the way to go.

"
6730,6 october 2016,taurus,"The cosmos is creating a “tortoise and the hare” situation today, with energetic Mars squaring Jupiter. You risk the danger of being so anxious to complete a task that you overlook, fudge or worse—screw up—key details. Don’t go there. Slow and steady is going to win this race, something that you need to keep in mind through the 16th of the month.

"
6731,7 october 2016,taurus,"Resist the urge to control every aspect of your life and those of the people in your environment, which includes co-workers. The fiery Sun is in your house of efficiency, and an angle today with Pluto could encourage you to come down hard on people whom you feel are not pulling their weight. Mercury enters this part of the sky today, making you even more determined to get things done. Since this is the planet of intelligence and fast thinking, your productivity will only increase; don’t worry about what others are (not) doing.

"
6732,8 october 2016,taurus,"Feeling adventurous? You should be, considering that the Moon meets up with energetic Mars today in your risk-taking ninth house. Don’t be surprised if a pal suggests doing something that’s not typical, such as flying off to the Galapagos Islands or doing some cave diving. Teaming up with others for any reason is wise right now, such as charity work or networking at an industry event to make new contacts. Get out there and mingle.

"
6733,9 october 2016,taurus,"Are you afraid to take a risk? The current planetary lineup indicates that you may be holding back when it comes to pursuing an ambition. You’re in an incredible expansive place right now, with many possibilities on offer–even if it doesn’t feel that way. Pull off the blinders and take a chance.

"
6734,10 october 2016,taurus,"Your brain strikes the right balance between short-term planning and focusing on the big picture too with a productive Moon-Mercury-Jupiter connection. Happy Jupiter should make you feel optimistic about your plans, and intelligent Mercury will help keep it real.

"
6735,11 october 2016,taurus,"Efficiency is key, Taurus. You’ll be inspired to be at the top of your game, both at home and at work, with Mercury and Jupiter holding a meeting today in your productivity sector. But this isn’t just about finding quicker ways to plod through chores. Hell no, you’re going to consider big possibilities for the year ahead and strategize how to attain them.

"
6736,12 october 2016,taurus,"Thinking about going into the office today, guns a blazin’? No matter how brilliant your ideas may be, no matter how polished a presentation you possess, it would be wise to tone down your approach. The issue at hand is that smarty pants Mars in your house of opinions may make you come across a wee bit…smug. Or maybe just too intelligent and organized for your co-workers.

"
6737,13 october 2016,taurus,"Details, details. You need focus on them, Taurus, like it or not. It’s fine to have grand ambitions, plans and lists but if you’re in too much of a rush to make the finish line you might overlook some key points. Mars and Pluto are firing up your ambition to break out of ruts and put through changes, which is all good. But the Sun and Jupiter demand a keen eye on the smaller stuff.

"
6738,14 october 2016,taurus,"Excellent day for making long term plans that will build a bigger nest egg. This covers a lot of ground: talking to an investment adviser, accountant or attorney; going after bigger clients with deeper pockets; looking for a higher-paying job; or adding products and services to your company’s lineup with greater potential for profit. Sunday’s full moon, though, falls in your house of confidentiality. Keep things quiet for now.

"
6739,15 october 2016,taurus,"No matter how carefully you’ve made plans, no matter how meticulous you’ve been in your work or errands, today a monkey wrench could get thrown into things. It could be a person trying to pull rank or boss you around; or someone wreaking havoc more quietly behind the scenes. It’s also possible that it’s not a person but a circumstance, such as a traffic jam that keeps you from getting somewhere on time. Whatever. Let this pass, even if it gets emotional. You’ll have the opportunity to dive back into your projects more efficiently next week.

"
6740,16 october 2016,taurus,"Enough is enough. Today’s full moon falls in your house of closure, and it’s time to reflect upon what’s working in your life and what’s not. This can be tense or painful, but on the other hand it can be cathartic and cleansing. Spontaneous Uranus is close to the Moon, indicating that you could experience an “aha!” moment in which you resolve to close out people, circumstances and thought patterns rather quickly. Leave the past behind and move on.

"
6741,17 october 2016,taurus,"Feed your head! A mind-opening aspect between the Moon and metamorphic Pluto is all about broadening your horizons: traveling more, going back to school maybe, meeting new people, studying philosophy or metaphysics, and basically living a more adventurous life! What’s not to like about that? Take it and run with it!

"
6742,18 october 2016,taurus,"Time to head to Victoria’s Secret. Sexy Venus just glided into your house of sensuality and intimacy for a three-week stay! Lest you think that this is just about canoodling, it’a actually a soulful house where you can bond emotionally and spiritually with another person. Let your feelings show.

"
6743,19 october 2016,taurus,"Mars and Pluto are meeting up today, churning up your desire to make progress in all areas of your life, which is a good thing. However, these are both aggressive little dudes, which means that you could become way too focused on fast results as you eye what’s going on in the lives of others. Control the urge to play the “keeping up with the Joneses” game (or the Kardashians for that matter). Your life is yours alone, and progress can’t be forced. Make sure that you pay attention to the process  of your goal attainment, not just the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

"
6744,20 october 2016,taurus,"A project could get temporarily derailed as a sudden occurrence mucks things up. Maybe it’s self-doubt on your part, or interference from someone who’s determined to just be difficult. You may have seen signs of this brewing toward the end of last week so it may not come as much of a surprise. The recent full moon should have pointed out your own weak points as well as those of others. Since you only have control over yours, start working on them now.

"
6745,21 october 2016,taurus,"With courageous Mars and Pluto both pushing you to move past previous limitations, no one would blame you for feeling a little unsettled. After all, change makes a lot of us a bit edgy. Today you may feel it as the Moon opposes the other two orbs in the heavens. However, this vibe passes within a day or so, but while it’s in play, why not analyze the fears and considerations that may be holding you back?

"
6746,22 october 2016,taurus,"Serious relationships receive a breath of fresh air now that the energetic Sun has entered your seventh house of partnering. Candid Mercury enters this part of your chart on Monday, helping all bulls communicate with their beloved—or a business alliance. Single Taureans won’t be in any mood for playing around; it’s serious commitment time, and the new moon on the 30th is custom made for opening up a brand new chapter in romance for all.

"
6747,23 october 2016,taurus,"The division of labor in a group or team activity may need to be revised in the days ahead. Make sure that you’re not carrying all of the weight, a good possibility with generous, optimistic Jupiter in your work sector. You run the risk of taking on too many responsibilities which will enable others to slack. Don’t let them use guilt or charm to wriggle out of their tasks.

"
6748,24 october 2016,taurus,"Time to have “The Talk” with a romantic partner now that candid Mercury has entered your house of commitment. If you’re already married this is still an excellent period for working out any issues or lingering questions, especially with a new moon in the same part of the sky occurring soon. Singles, don’t waste your time on players, married people or commitment-phobes. It’s all about the real thing right now.

"
6749,25 october 2016,taurus,"Mixed signals! That’s the situation with a confusing Venus-Neptune square. Some of the people closest to you may act in strange ways, running hot-cold, passive-aggressive, decisive then stalling. As a result your emotions may bubble over, but this is a tempest in a teapot. Let it pass. For today, let your own wisdom guide you rather than the opinions of others.

"
6750,27 october 2016,taurus,"Time for “the Talk”? A brilliant Mercury-Sun conjunction in your house of commitment means that it’s time to figure out which direction a relationship is heading in. This goes for business alliances as well. Is it time to hire a booking agent, PR firm or consultant? Or maybe you need to get rid of your existing representatives and find a new one. At the romance level, singles could meet a keeper in the days ahead, and the “just dating” crowd could get a lot more serious.

"
6751,28 october 2016,taurus,"A work colleague, client or friend could be key in helping you land a new job, better assignments or help you switch to a different department. Good things are being said about you as your work ethic speaks for itself. There’s a karmic vibe to this too, as the years you’ve spent developing your craft are about to pay off.

"
6752,29 october 2016,taurus,"A tug-of-war between safety and security versus being adventurous takes place today. Part of you may just want to settle down in a committed relationship, for example, while another side of you desires to explore other “opportunities”. A practical voice in your head tells you to stay at the day job for the regular paycheck and benefits while another little voice whispers to take a chance and become an entrepreneur. The good news is that serious Saturn is in an excellent position in your chart, indicating that whatever decision you make will be based on logic and careful planning.

"
6753,30 october 2016,taurus,"Thinking about teaming up with someone to advance your career? If that’s the case today’s new moon sets the stage for progress–including the financial kind. Whether you form a traditional business partnership or hire someone to represent you (such as a booking agent or PR firm), it has success written all over it. And since this lunation falls in the house of serious relationships, it’s time to find a keeper if you’re single. Attached bulls should plan the next logical step in their romance. Neptune is in quite the amorous mood, so if you don’t have enough sizzle in your life, go out there and find it!

"
6754,31 october 2016,taurus,"There is power in numbers, something that you would be wise to pay attention to this week. Teaming up with someone for a common goal or end result is the way to go, rather than trying to do battle all by yourself. With erratic Uranus acting up, someone or something behind the scenes could throw a monkey wrench into your plans–all the more reason to have someone in your corner.

"
6755,1 november 2016,taurus,"Common ground. You can reach it today with someone close, such as a lover or even a group of colleagues at the office. There may have been confusion in past months about the specific direction to head in with a project or goal. As a matter of fact, there may have been people stalling and obfuscating. But that clears up with a brilliant Sun-Neptune trine.

"
6756,2 november 2016,taurus,"Who needs a warm body? Not you, Taurus! With the passionate Moon swinging past love planet Venus, and other planets in your commitment sector in a lively mood, you’re not going to be interested in having a partner just for the sake of being coupled up. Heck no, this is all about passion, lust and excitement. So if your love life has been a snooze (or nonexistent for that matter) it’s time for a romantic reboot.

"
6757,3 november 2016,taurus,"No man (or woman) is an island, and the planets are encouraging you to team up with others rather than trying to do it all on your own. With the Sun and Mercury in your partnership sector it would be wise to consider the input and assistance another person can provide. An influential person may enter your life in the near future who will open your eyes to brand new possibilities.

"
6758,4 november 2016,taurus,"The planets are increasing your tolerance for risk, but that doesn’t mean that you’re going to quit the day job to sell pina coladas on a Caribbean beach. However, you could  start thinking more about being your own boss. This not only applies to your occupation, but also to taking greater control of your life in general: your education, travel plans, living arrangements and relationships.

"
6759,5 november 2016,taurus,"Still waters run deep, and sometimes they can become a boiling cauldron. Keep your emotions (and therefore your words and actions) under control today as erratic Uranus is pushing your buttons. This isn’t necessarily a problem if you can control the flow of your statements. It can actually be beneficial for you to get your feelings out there so that others know what’s going on inside your head and heart. Just don’t reveal too much too soon.

"
6760,7 november 2016,taurus,"Assertive Mars enters your career house on Wednesday for the first time in two years, but this time around is a game changer. Are you willing to settle for the same old position, salary or even industry? With Saturn in Sag, I would say that the answer is “hell, no!”  It’s time to secure your financial future for decades to come with strong Saturn by your side. Do what it takes to strengthen your foundation.

"
6761,8 november 2016,taurus,"It’s not what you know, it’s who you know, and someone in a position of power may be willing to help you from behind the scenes. If you know of a person— a mentor, industry contact, friend—who’s well-connected, reach out to them today. When Mars enters your house of ambition on Wednesday for the first time in two years, you’ll be quite interested in working those connections.

"
6762,9 november 2016,taurus,"You’re entering a highly productive phase in which your ideas, plans and schemes will be front and center. The full moon in Taurus on the 14th will permit you to step away from other people’s dramas and agendas and attend to your own needs. With assertive Mars entering your house of ambition today for the first time in two years, don’t be surprised if you’re ready to bolt ahead with new projects.

"
6763,10 november 2016,taurus,"Need advice? Call a trusted friend or mentor. They’ll be the best source of information and inspiration today. Now that go-getter Mars is in your house of ambition, you could be overwhelmed by the possibilities and projects that lie ahead. By the time of Monday’s full moon in your sign, you will have developed more clarity and know exactly which path to take.

"
6764,12 november 2016,taurus,"Your outlook for achieving your ambitions is off the charts, Taurus! Mars just entered your success zone, Venus is now in your house of optimism and taking chances, and today Mercury glides into your big-money sector. The messenger planet is also perfectly poised to help you out with matters of the heart, so don’t hold back your words or emotions.

"
6765,13 november 2016,taurus,"The biggest super moon since 1948 arrives tomorrow, and it occurs in your sign! Start creating a short list of the things you’d like to manifest in the year ahead. You may find that others around you–friends, lovers, co-workers–are not as enthusiastic as you are about your dreams, but don’t let that stop you. Look out for #1.

"
6766,14 november 2016,taurus,"Shine a light on me! The biggest super moon since 1948 takes place in your sign, Taurus. It’s time to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight. There’s nothing wrong with putting your needs and dreams on the front burner. Brand new, important cycles can begin now, so spend some time thinking about what you’d like to manifest in the year ahead. But when you start mapping out your path, pay close attention to the details and don’t expect things to happen overnight. Mars in your house of ambition could make you way  too impatient.

"
6767,15 november 2016,taurus,"With aggressive Mars blazing a trail through your house of ambition, nothing is going to stop you from moving forward with things that are important to you. But you would be wise to keep your own counsel today rather than listening to the advice of others, including “friends”. A tense Moon-Neptune aspect that people around you may be trying to dissuade you from making progress. This energy reappears on Friday, so stay on your toes.

"
6768,16 november 2016,taurus,"The role that you play in a romantic or business partnership may need to be adjusted, Taurus, and this is an issue that could get touchy. If you feel that you’ve been taking on too much responsibility in the relationship, you must let the other person know where you stand. Likewise, it may be your turn to pick up some of the slack. Either way, the situation plays out nicely, as you both will be breathing a sigh of relief once you’ve aired your opinions.

"
6769,17 november 2016,taurus,"You may think that you know everything there is to expressing your opinions and deepest feelings, but the planets indicate that your communication skills could use some polishing up. But part of the problem lately also seems to be defensiveness on your part. Are you suspicious of the motives of friends or a loved one? Ask yourself that question before you start to rant, accuse or whimper. Make sure you have the facts first.

"
6770,18 november 2016,taurus,"Keep your wits about you and don’t make any major decisions today, Taurus. Confusing Neptune is stirring up some pretty murky waters, and they could be coming from someone close. They may be trying to push your buttons to gain some kind of emotional advantage over you, something you certainly don’t need. The recent full moon fell in your sign, and it was designed to help you kick off brand new cycles. If someone in your circle doesn’t fit, it may be time to cut the tie and move on.

"
6771,19 november 2016,taurus,"It’s time to clean house, but I’m not talking about your abode. I’m referring to the network of people in your life, from friends to industry contacts to people in volunteer organizations you’re involved in. If someone doesn’t have your best interests at heart, nor the good of the group, they need to be removed. How you handle this—gently or grittily—is up to you. A positive Venus-Neptune aspect today indicates that some big plans of yours are about to take flight. You don’t need any baggage holding you back!

"
6772,20 november 2016,taurus,"You’ll be in a far sultrier mood over the next four weeks once the Sun enters Sagittarius tomorrow. With the Moon in your domestic sector today winking at unpredictable Uranus, it’s time to turn your bedroom into a boudoir. Or a lair. Your choice. Head out to the store and stock up on some new sheets, pillows, candles and room fragrance. You can thank me later.

"
6773,21 november 2016,taurus,"Open book? You may become one over the next four weeks now that the Sun is in your house of intimacy and sharing. But are the people around you as candid? Consider that over the next week, as planetary influences warn you to selectively share your opinions and emotions. Next week’s new moon on the 29th ushers in a new phase in which you may decide to trust your gut more than what others say or do.

"
6774,22 november 2016,taurus,"Time is money, and that old saying applies to you today, Taurus. Becoming more efficient is the name of the game, and today intelligent Mercury will help you uncover new habits and tips that will streamline your work flow. The more productive you become, the more money you’ll end up having in your wallet. It’s as simple as that.

"
6775,23 november 2016,taurus,"Close relationships reach a turning point with an important Saturn-Mercury meeting. If someone hasn’t been sharing their thoughts or their heart with you 100%, it’s time for a serious talk. Naturally, this isn’t always easy. But with a new moon arriving next week in this part of your chart, it’s wise to start discussions right now.

"
6776,24 november 2016,taurus,"Can’t see the forest for the trees? A touchy Jupiter-Pluto aspect today indicates that you may be nitpicking or focusing on small details that don’t count. In doing so, you misunderstand or miss the point about a person or situation. A more open-minded point of view starts to spread through your mind on Friday, like a fresh breeze blowing gently through a window. Eventually you’ll be able to see the big picture as it really is.

"
6777,25 november 2016,taurus,"With so many planets situated in the parts of the chart that deal with your deepest emotions, it’s not surprising if you’re doing a lot of soul searching. A cathartic Venus-Pluto aspect helps you release pent up feelings and to be honest not only with the people closest to you, but also yourself. It’s time to let go of feelings that may have been holding you back, and today’s energy is perfect for that fresh start.

"
6778,27 november 2016,taurus,"Your attitudes and philosophy about life are changing, Taurus, and it’s safe to say that by this time next year, you won’t be the same person. But this is all for the best. With Uranus in the most hidden part of your chart you may not be ready to let the world know what you’re thinking, at least not in the near future. But that will change in December as you increasingly get in touch with your deepest feelings.

"
6779,28 november 2016,taurus,"Sometimes it’s wiser to only pay attention to facts and logic; other times it’s better to rely on your gut. The problem is lately that your brain and your gut are sending you mixed signals, creating confusion as to which direction to head in. The fog lifts with Tuesday’s new moon. It will provide a happy balance of rational thought along with a solid emotional foundation.

"
6780,29 november 2016,taurus,"You’re now in an excellent position to build wealth, courtesy of today’s new moon in your house of fiscal responsibility. However, don’t expect overnight results with anything you undertake: starting a business, investing in mutual funds, writing a best selling book or pursuing a court case. Sober, serious Saturn is in an excellent position to support the Moon (and therefore your goals) but this is also the planet of slow, steady achievement.

"
6781,30 november 2016,taurus,"You may want to keep an invisible wall up today between you and others as deceptive Neptune is active. This is especially true of friends, acquaintances, co-workers and people who are on a team with you. Someone in your circle may not be straightforward or honest, or they may be expecting you to carry the load. Be friendly, cooperate but look out for #1.

"
6782,1 december 2016,taurus,"December starts off with a bang! An energetic meet up between Mars and Jupiter helps put your career goals in high gear. Take charge of your future and start acting on ideas that you have for advancement. With lucky and optimistic Jupiter in your house of the “daily grind”, you should be able to uncover ways to become more efficient—and time is money.

"
6783,2 december 2016,taurus,"Despite the fact that aggressive Mars is tearing through your house of ambition and goals, you should set aside time for enjoyable pursuits. And with Mercury entering your house of adventure today, you should be able to dream up at least a few fun things that should be added to your bucket list. Like: learning how to cook French cuisine, trekking through the Andes Mountains, taking a hot air balloon ride or learning how to flamenco dance. The thing about bucket lists, though, is they need to be acted upon! So stop waiting and start planning—and doing.

"
6784,3 december 2016,taurus,"It’s time to get serious about building a strong financial foundation: retirement money, college funds for the kids, solid health benefits and a substantial savings account. Fortunately, Mars is actively ratcheting up your ambition to earn more, so consider your options. Reach out today to the people who can help you take on more responsibility and earn more cash. Next Tuesday is excellent for some private brainstorming.

"
6785,4 december 2016,taurus,"Practicality is the word o’ the week with dynamic Mars forming a helpful angle with Jupiter. Whatever your plans may be for your family, finances, career, or love life, it’s imperative to keep it real. Today you may become inspired to get off your duff and take action, which is a wise move. The cosmos will be pushing you to make some big decisions between now and the full moon on the 13th.

"
6786,5 december 2016,taurus,"Finding a balance between being assertive and secretive is your challenge today, Taurus. The cosmos is currently telling you to go within for wisdom and to keep some things to yourself. On the other hand you need to communicate with others and let them know you’re in charge. Call it diplomacy, call it discretion, but either way, the world isn’t entitled to know your deepest thoughts…or agenda.

"
6787,6 december 2016,taurus,"Stop putting off self-care, hoping that “someday” in the future you’ll have the time to read that book, get a massage or start a mindfulness meditation practice. The cosmos tells you that now is the time to nurture yourself and that you need to take charge of your level of serenity and contentment. To your surprise, you may find that just spending a half hour on yourself brings so many benefits that you decide to dig in and make this a regular practice.

"
6788,7 december 2016,taurus,"The holidays may be coming, but don’t even think about putting your career on the back burner until after New Year’s. That’s because magnetic Venus enters your house of ambition today, urging you to reach out to people who can take your aspirations to the next level. This is also the house of all  of your big goals, so now is the time to plan your 2017 resolutions.

"
6789,8 december 2016,taurus,"With Mars, Venus and the Moon all in your house of ambition today, it’s an understatement to say that you’re on a roll. Just don’t roll over other people in your desire to get ahead. You’re actually better off keeping your own counsel and not letting others know what you’re up to these days. Think “stealth” and not calling attention to yourself.

"
6790,9 december 2016,taurus,"Hunt down productive hacks that will streamline your life, both at home and the office. With next week’s full moon falling in your house of making mo’ money, you definitely need to become more productive if you want to earn and save more. There is an emotional payoff to getting your act together: an increased feeling of self-worth and greater peace of mind.

"
6791,10 december 2016,taurus,"A funky mood could pervade serious relationships today as stern Saturn forces you to face reality. The same holds true for your finances. If you’re overspending and under saving, it’s time to develop some fiscal responsibility. Not getting what you need from a lover? Then get real and get out. Next week’s full moon falls in your house of self-worth, and if yours is low, you need to get clear as to why.

"
6792,11 december 2016,taurus,"If you feel like busting loose from the ideals of society, or your family, or your friends, there’s a good reason! The Moon forms a spunky aspect today with metamorphic Pluto in the most adventurous part of your chart. Playing it safe and conforming to the rules isn’t going to appear very appetizing. Let’s face it, did all the great artists, scientists, inventors and authors produce their masterpieces by following the status quo? Hell no. They turned it upside down.

"
6793,12 december 2016,taurus,"Financial security is the name of the game these days as the cosmos focuses on building wealth for you, Taurus. Pay close attention to your gut hunches as your intuition can guide you into making smart decisions. If something seems to good to be true, avoid it; with tomorrow’s full moon in your house of security you need to make sure that everything, from your income to investments, is rock solid.

"
6794,13 december 2016,taurus,"Fiscal responsibility is the name of the game with today’s full moon in your house of earnings. You’re in a terrific spot to score a raise, bonus or new job, but make saving money a priority. If you’re looking for a new job, don’t assume that the week after Christmas is going to be dead. The cosmos is dishing up positive career aspects every day from the 26th through the 30th.

"
6795,14 december 2016,taurus,"Keep your head down at the office today as a tense Uranus-Jupiter aspect could fray your nerves. Co-workers and clients may be raring to go with a project or idea, but you seem to be holding back. Problem is, if you voice your concerns there could be pushback. Your best bet is to keep your mouth shut and go along with the crowd—just for today. When Mars enters Pisces next week you’ll be more willing to be a team player.

"
6796,15 december 2016,taurus,"Something may happen today that will let you see a person or a situation for what they really are and it may come as a bit of a surprise. It could be a statement or an action. It also could be an intuitive hit that you receive from the cosmos. But voicing it is not wise under current planetary conditions. As a matter of fact, once Mercury retrogrades next Monday in your opinionated ninth house it would be wise to keep a lot of thoughts to yourself. Become more of an observer than a talker.

"
6797,17 december 2016,taurus,"You can get to the bottom of an issue that has either perplexed you or has been a source of worry. And the good news is that the solution to this dilemma may arrive on the scene very quickly. Once you get everything settled, your peace of mind should increase dramatically, although the planets indicate that you may need to make some changes on a personal, emotional level. New habits such as mindfulness, or refusing to judge people and situations could help you enormously.

"
6798,18 december 2016,taurus,"With aggressive Mars wrapping up its tour through your house of ambition today, you may be wiped out. Summon up the energy to put the finishing touches on goals and projects you’re working on. Then get ready to party as the energetic red planet blasts into your house of friends and networking tomorrow. This should be a far more social holiday season than in years past!

"
6799,19 december 2016,taurus,"Over the next seven weeks, your grandest schemes can begin to take flight. Dynamic Mars has just entered your eleventh house of long-held dreams, and networking with others may well be the best way to achieve them. However, with Mercury retrograding in the house of skill development and learning new perspectives, it’s critical to take your time and make sure that you have the right stuff before you lift off.

"
6800,20 december 2016,taurus,"Double check your holiday travel plans now that Mercury has retrograded in this part of your chart. Likewise, if you’re going to book a vacation between now and January 12th, make sure that you receive confirmations and go over them for mistakes. The same holds true for college applications, term papers and dissertations, marketing plans, manuscripts, screen plays, and any applications that deal with government agencies, such as citizenship or the division of motor vehicles. Mercury is back spinning in the part of your chart that’s known as the “far and wide” sector—traveling long distances, getting your message out to the masses, or expressing yourself in a very public way.

"
6801,21 december 2016,taurus,"Woo-hoo! The Sun moves into the most adventurous part of your chart today, asking you to take some calculated risks. Maybe it’s time to leave that soul sucking job or move across country. Perhaps you need to start dating different kinds of people. And while you’re it, shouldn’t you stop talking about “someday”? Someday I’ll write that book, start that business, patent my invention, travel around the world, leave my husband. Someday is here, and the time is now.

"
6802,22 december 2016,taurus,"If you’re sick and tired of routines and doing things the same old way, you can blame it on the emotional Moon meeting up with Jupiter in your house of getting things done. But what’s wrong with shaking things up a little bit? If the tried and true isn’t working, should you keep doing it? Maybe it’s time to break out of a rut and forge a new path.

"
6803,23 december 2016,taurus,"Even thought the holiday slowdown is about to begin, this is the perfect day to network with people whom you’d like to partner with in 2017. They could be business contacts, local parents, people in your church group, members of a volunteer organization, or your pals. Likewise, think about seminars or trade shows that could be helpful to your personal and career development. Tuesday the 27th is a good day to take these plans further.

"
6804,24 december 2016,taurus,"Emotions ride high today with an energetic Saturn-Uranus trine. Passion for a lover can increase, or just a passion to live life more fully! Why hide in the shadows when you can be living large and loving life? With Uranus in a self-reflective place, it’s not surprising that you would be thinking deeply about the future. The new moon on the 29th is the time to kick off new initiatives.

"
6805,25 december 2016,taurus,"You’ll be stepping into a more authoritative role in the weeks ahead, whether that’s at work, a volunteer organization you’re part of, or a family matter. So relax and enjoy the day. But the word “authoritative” doesn’t mean grim or nose to the grindstone; on the contrary, there will be a lot of fun and optimism with this.

"
6806,27 december 2016,taurus,"“When you wish upon a star, your dreams will take you very far..”  So sang the group Earth, Wind and Fire back in the ’70’s. Well Taurus, today’s your day to dream big with a super Mars-Sun connection. The fact that these two dynamic orbs are teaming up right before 2017 begins is highly auspicious. Start planning what you’d like to manifest now, and don’t wait for January 1st to get going. The new moon on the 29th is your best time to launch.

"
6807,28 december 2016,taurus,"My, aren’t we anxious! A super charged meeting between the Sun and Mars in two of the most visionary and optimistic parts of your chart are firing up your desire to make some big changes. One of the things you need to consider today is the image that you present to the world, and that includes your brand if you have one. Perception is reality to many people, and whether that’s fair or not is another issue. Get into your A game.

"
6808,29 december 2016,taurus,"Just say “Ohmmm.” Uranus finishes back stroking through the house of your subconscious mind. Over the past five months you may have wrestled with fears, dramas, and negative thought patterns. Now that the quirky planet is moving direct, greater peace of mind should be coming your way. It’s the perfect time to open your mind to ancient or foreign philosophies, such as Zen Buddhism, thanks to a new moon taking place in your house of learning.

"
6809,30 december 2016,taurus,"Yesterday’s new moon sparkled with possibilities for the future, and today is perfect for delving into one of them. What would make you the happiest in 2017? If it’s something that requires a little research, get started now. When Mars and Neptune meet up on New Year’s Day in the house of your deepest hopes and wishes, all systems are “go”.

"
6810,31 december 2016,taurus,"Some of the not so pleasant emotions that have been troubling you for awhile may start to dissipate, thanks to a helpful aspect between Saturn and Uranus. Healing can take years or it can happen in an instant, and it seems as though you’ll be able to close out past dramas more quickly than you thought possible.

"
6811,1 january 2017,gemini,"My, my, aren’t we motivated! With a powerhouse meeting of Mars and Neptune in your house of ambition and success, you are definitely  determined to make your mark this year. “If I can dream it, I can do it” is your motto, Gemini, but you have to be mindful of just one thing: keep your feet on the ground. Foggy Neptune is inspirational, yes, but when it teams up with Mars you run the risk of boldly charging down a path without giving a lot of logical thought to what you’re doing. Slow down.

"
6812,2 january 2017,gemini,"You have some big plans for the near future in mind, but the cosmos suggests that you slow down and get more of the picture before you move ahead. The problem is that you may be operating too much on emotion and not enough on logic, thanks to the vibey Moon meeting up with foggy Neptune today. If career or other projects require the input or cooperation of someone else, get in touch with them between tomorrow and the 8th to review plans.

"
6813,3 january 2017,gemini,"2017 kicked off with Mars and Neptune firing up your house of ambition and success, and now magnetic Venus joins them for a four week stay. Getting up every day and doing work that you love will become more important to you, and the new moon on the 27th will increase your optimism that it can happen. There is a strong financial focus for you in January that will help you follow your bliss–logically, carefully and with a solid financial foundation.

"
6814,4 january 2017,gemini,"Passion rules! The next week could be quite a steamy one in the boudoir, Gemini, but it could also create confusion in romance. That’s because Mercury retrogrades today into your house of commitment, bringing up issues from the past that need to be resolved. At the same time the Sun and Pluto move ever closer in your house of libido, stirring up emotions and desires. Don’t let sex or lust blind you to matters that must be straightened out.

"
6815,5 january 2017,gemini,"Power struggles may be building in some kind of team effort, such as a department at work, a family reunion or wedding, a volunteer effort or among friends. Someone could push your buttons today, or perhaps the whole scene is just getting on your nerves. Take a breather and try to take the long view. As next week’s full moon approaches on the 12th, this nonsense could intensify, so if you can cut off any negative thoughts about it now the better off you’ll be.

"
6816,6 january 2017,gemini,"The desire to be on the same page with someone isn’t the same as actually being there! And an emotional Moon aspect today could fire up your wishes to be in agreement with another party, be they business or personal. Not to worry. When Mercury resumes direct motion on Sunday you’ll be able to communicate more freely. Truth be told, over the month of January you’ll have to continue to negotiate with others, especially on the 10th, 11th and 19th. This energy will be in play for several weeks, so patience is key.

"
6817,7 january 2017,gemini,"The eighth house in astrology is all about sharing with others: your body, soul and even your financial assets. Yup, we’re talking about sex, intimacy and money! And today two of the most persuasive orbs in the cosmos, the Sun and Pluto, hold a convo in this part of your chart. Your emotions and passion could rise in matters of the heart, as you may experience intense desire for someone else—but are they right for you? Pluto is all about domination and control, so you have to watch the tendency to go into dictator mode in love. But being a powerhouse in finance is another story, so step into that role and make the cash register ring!

"
6818,8 january 2017,gemini,"Swing back into action with business deals–Mercury goes direct today, freeing up stalled contracts and joint ventures. The messenger planet has been retro in your house of serious partnerships, which includes romantic alliances, so if there has been tension and crossed lines with your amour things should start to smooth over. You need to get matters straightened out before the full moon on Thursday, which will shine its light on the state of your union: how strong it is and how secure you feel.

"
6819,9 january 2017,gemini,"Keep the BS meter powered up today, as it could get pretty deep. Someone may try to pull rank as they’re tossing those bull chips, so don’t be surprised if a boss or a boss wannabe is acting out. This could also be a lover, client, banker or anyone else who perceives themselves to be higher and mightier than the rest. With the Moon in Gemini, you could become too emotional for your own good, so count to ten and let ’em rant. Namaste.

"
6820,10 january 2017,gemini,"Be careful where you invest or spend your hard earned money today, as a difficult Sun-Uranus aspect could affect your ability to make a sound decision. Likewise, don’t be pressured into doing anything  you don’t want to do, and that includes your personal relationships. With the Sun in the most passionate part of your chart you’re relying more on feelings than logic, and someone may try to take advantage of that.

"
6821,11 january 2017,gemini,"Power struggles may be erupting in key relationships both at work and in your personal life, so you need to watch your moods and temper. Tomorrow’s full moon falls in your house of security and guarantees, possible making you keenly aware that you need more money, commitment or help from others. But are they willing to cooperate? Just make sure that you’re not the one acting in a domineering manner. If others do, put them in their place.

"
6822,12 january 2017,gemini,"Today the cosmos delivers a full moon in Cancer, your annual opportunity to land a higher paying job, a promotion, or to take your company’s revenues to a much higher level. This lunation may finally see something come to a happy conclusion, something that you’ve been working on for some time. But separating the wheat from the chaff is the issue thanks to a Grand Cross that could make decision making difficult. Examine the fine print on financial documents and job offers and know exactly which responsibilities will be yours in the future (and those of other people). Don’t assume that a team has its act together or that a creative vision is on point. Do your homework before making a decision.

"
6823,13 january 2017,gemini,"One thing’s for sure–you want guarantees about the future, and that means in all areas of your life. A happy meet up between Venus and Neptune is designed to put things in greater focus for you. Your romance, finances and overall peace of mind can all benefit from the greater sense of security that is building inside of you. The key is to take off the rose-colored glasses and see people and situations for what they really are first.

"
6824,14 january 2017,gemini,"Some pretty sweet financial opportunities could be coming your way, but you must be realistic about them. Whether it’s a new job, a joint venture or investing money in a retirement account, make sure that you have all the details before you sign on the dotted line. The possibility exists that you may be too starry eyed, expecting overnight success. The outlook really is good, especially after the Sun enters Aquarius next Thursday, but you shouldn’t count your chickens before they hatch.

"
6825,15 january 2017,gemini,"Got guilt? If someone is trying to make you feel like you owe them something, Gemini, it may get on your nerves! Whether the other person thinks that they need love, money, a favor, a job or your undivided attention, it seems that they’re pushing it. Draw some boundaries, otherwise you’ll end up being a doormat.

"
6826,16 january 2017,gemini,"Financial opportunities surround you, some of which could really add to your net worth. But do you see them? Start paying attention. With dynamic Mars in your house of ambition and powerhouse Pluto in the net worth sector, you may need to do things differently to get ahead. But then every millionaire eventually figured that out!

"
6827,17 january 2017,gemini,"Matters of the heart can be a roller coaster this week, so put on your seat belt. Today emotions can bubble up to the surface, especially resentment and fear. If a lover isn’t willing to communicate it will only serve to piss you off even more. Wait until tomorrow to talk, but know this: if you want this situation to be resolved, you’re going to have to take ownership of it.

"
6828,18 january 2017,gemini,"Goal oriented? You should be, considering that energetic Mars is now in the success and ambition part of your chart. Today is stellar for making progress with something that’s important to you as Mars forms a helpful aspect with bountiful Jupiter. Fresh new creative ideas can come your way, concepts that may change the way you’ve been going about things. But these are beneficial. Remember, do things the way you’ve always done and you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.

"
6829,19 january 2017,gemini,"Roadblocks! That’s what you may be facing in love and career matters as the two most stubborn planets in the cosmos square each other today. Mars, who wanted everything yesterday, is annoyed with Saturn, who claims that long term success comes from slow and steady improvement. It’s the classic tortoise and hare scenario. So what’s a Gemini to do? Stay calm, because this energy continues into next week. Things should start to gain momentum after the new moon on the 27th.

"
6830,20 january 2017,gemini,"Impatient, are we? The Sun just entered the most visionary part of your chart, a good thing. And red hot Mars is in your house of ambition—which can also be a blessing. The downside, however, is that this potent mix could lead to frustration and impatience that events aren’t happening fast enough. Under current planetary influences you will  need the cooperation of other people to achieve your aims. They should start to support you more after the 28th.

"
6831,21 january 2017,gemini,"It may be the weekend but it’s a super time to work on passion projects, and if that includes career growth, so be it. A cluster of planets in your ambition sector are in a terrific angle to the Moon in your “let’s do this” house of efficiency. You can accomplish a lot on your own over the next week, and when Mars enters Aries on the 28th you will do even better by woking with others.

"
6832,22 january 2017,gemini,"The Sun is now in the most visionary part of your chart, pushing you to go past previous self limitations. But you won’t be doing this on your own as planetary aspects indicate that you’ll need the cooperation of others. A cooperative Moon-Sun angle today suggests that you talk over future plans with loved ones. Are you on the same page? Try to get there now, as February will be a big month for forward momentum.

"
6833,23 january 2017,gemini,"Long term relationships of all kinds are in the cosmos’s crosshairs for you today, Gemini. A Moon-Saturn conjunction in the part of your chart that deals with partnerships shines its light on alliances of both a personal or business nature. It’s quite possible that an offer could come your way for a job, a date, a joint business venture or the opportunity to join a group that you’ve longed to be a member of. This entire week is an active one in the heavens, so stay on your toes.

"
6834,24 january 2017,gemini,"Which way is up? You’re going to have to get clear about which way you’re heading, whether it’s a solo effort or an alliance with a partner or group. The good news is that the planet of inspiration, Neptune, is in your ambition sector. So is magnetic Venus and assertive Mars. The problem is that they may be presenting your mind with so many options that it seems like you’re standing on line at a buffet, not knowing which yummy delicacy to go after. Fortunately intelligent Mercury steps in and helps you make the choice that brings you the most passion.

"
6835,25 january 2017,gemini,"Feel like life is just dishing up the same old s*** day after day? Well, the cosmos wants to change that for you. Metamorphic Pluto and smart little Mercury are currently in your house of passion, and today they’re joined by the emotional Moon. It’s possible that you could feel annoyed or drained from being in a rut. On the other hand, you could feel energized and ready to rock and roll. Either way, momentum is starting to build as you become a lot more motivated to pursue a meaningful life. And this is just the warmup: the real action starts with Friday’s new moon.

"
6836,26 january 2017,gemini,"Toss out old ways of thinking and take a fresh approach! With three planets in your house of ambition, chances are you’re anxious to get important plans underway. Nothing wrong with that, but the planets are telling you today to be more creative and think more in big picture, conceptual ways. This energy is only going to increase after tomorrow’s new moon in the most free spirited part of your chart. Chasing your passions shouldn’t be a drag—it should bring you joy!

"
6837,27 january 2017,gemini,"Today’s new moon in Aquarius is making you more than ready to soar to new heights, but is everyone around you ready to do the same? This is especially true in serious romantic relationships due to a harsh Venus-Saturn square. You may be looking for guarantees from a lover that they’re not ready to give, or perhaps it’s the other way around. That being said, the atmosphere bodes well for discussion. It may be simply a matter of getting more intimately acquainted with the other person’s thoughts and feelings before progress can be made. Singles, you’re perfectly positioned to meet a sexy flame who’s quite a break from the usual type.

6838,28 january 2017,gemini,"Expect your social calendar to start filling up as energizer bunny Mars barrels into your eleventh house of fun, parties, networking, trade events, and charity work. This also happens to be the sector that governs technology, so now is the time to launch or develop a website, blog, online store or app. Yesterday’ s new moon in your house of international business dealings means that these projects could really take off.

"
6839,29 january 2017,gemini,"Comparing your life to others’ is never a good idea as we never really know what’s going on in someone else’s life. People post a lot of happy-happy stuff on their social media sites that may induce envy but isn’t grounded in reality. Beware the tendency of playing the comparison game, a possibility under current planetary aspects. Now that Mars is in your house of networking and camaraderie, you could be in a quite social mood. But keep a close eye on your emotions.

"
6840,30 january 2017,gemini,"Being idealistic is fine as long as you don’t enter the land of foo-foo fantasies that can’t be achieved. You’re in quite the visionary place right now, thanks to a number of planetary aspects that are opening your mind to new possibilities. But a Moon-Neptune conjunction today warns that you’ve got to keep it real. That being said, their meeting could fire up the passion you need to make things happen.

"
6841,31 january 2017,gemini,"The cosmos is telling you to get serious about developing a strong financial footing, and you’d be wise to listen. The issue is that the Sun and Mars are in houses that encourage adventure, entrepreneurship, attending a university, and being part of fun events like wedding parties or group vacations–all of which cost money. You need to temper your enthusiasm. Either create a short list of the things that absolutely must have funding now, or find thriftier ways to do all of them.

"
6842,1 february 2017,gemini,"It’s your life, Gemini, and you should march to the beat of your own drum. But today you might be getting way too much unsolicited advice from people around you who say they have your best interests at heart. The truth is that they may, but only you  really understand what makes you tick. Likewise, don’t waste your precious time comparing yourself to others.

"
6843,2 february 2017,gemini,"No man or woman is an island, and we often have to work with others, whether it’s planning a family reunion, the PTO bake sale or a brainstorming group at the office. The planets suggest that group activities need to be readjusted so that everyone is operating upon a more rational level rather than an emotional one. Obviously you can’t control what others will say or do, but you don’t have to participate in unnecessary dramas and diva meltdowns.

"
6844,3 february 2017,gemini,"Work the room! The next four weeks are super for networking, regardless whether it’s for finding new love or a new gig. Now that Venus is in your friendship sector the possibility of meeting influential people increases dramatically. Mastermind groups, bachelorette parties, family reunions and community organizations are all well aspected. However, on March 4th Venus retrogrades here, which may mean culling frenemies and people whose friendship you’ve outgrown. Make a short list.

"
6845,5 february 2017,gemini,"La Luna is in your sign today Gemini, which could make you reflective about your plans, emotional even. But try not to make any major decisions or launch something new until next Friday. Right now Neptune is obscuring facts and smart plans of action, but the stimulating Leo eclipse on Friday will burn away the fog. Swing into action then as the aspects are perfect for strategizing, talking about your plans with others, learning more and thinking bigger.

"
6846,6 february 2017,gemini,"Got call blocking? You may need it, Gemini! Jupiter retrogrades in your romance sector for the next four months, dredging up exes who may try to resurrect a relationship. Even if no one returns from the past, your love life could slow down a bit. Maybe you decide to take a breather from dating. Perhaps you start to put the brakes on an existing romance that needs to have issues worked out before you can take the next step. Having a baby may need to wait in order for you to save up money first. This time period isn’t a deal breaker, but a good time to make smart decisions after giving them enough thought.

"
6847,7 february 2017,gemini,"Tell it like it is! Now that verbal Mercury is in your worldly, highly opinionated ninth house your ideas can take you far. Your horizons can broaden under this aspect, so consider what you can do to live life a little bit bigger–by signing up for a class, traveling to a part of the world you’ve never been to, or learning a new skill for starters. Friday’s lunar eclipse is custom made for expansion and initiating projects.

"
6848,8 february 2017,gemini,"Don’t be surprised if you feel like you can’t keep everyone happy today, Gemini! From friends to kids to a lover, everyone wants a piece of you and they may be in a button-pushing mood. While this might rock your equilibrium, know that this weekend’s lunar eclipse is perfect for speaking your mind.

"
6849,9 february 2017,gemini,"Yowza! Your brain is on fire, Gemini, as the Sun in your house of visionary thinking winks at rebellious Uranus in the big plans sector. If there was ever a moment to toss out old, outmoded, “little” ways of thinking it’s now. This is an “if I can dream it I can do it” kind of aspect. The good news is that Friday’s lunar eclipse can help you take grandiose ideas and cut them down into workable chunks.

"
6850,10 february 2017,gemini,"As comedienne Joan Rivers used to say, “Can we talk?” You’re not known as being the wallflower of the zodiac, Gemini, but even you  are about to become a heck of a lot more social and chatty. Tonight’s lunar eclipse in Leo falls in your house of self-expression: the way you think, write, speak, and communicate your thoughts through creative means, like a book or a video. A super Moon-Uranus trine indicates that some visionary ideas of yours could be met with acclaim, so get ready to dazzle your colleagues or industry. On a personal level you can make progress with a lover as serious Saturn is in a good angle. Singles, this lunation could help you meet someone in the neighborhood, so look your best—not just today but over the next few months.

"
6851,11 february 2017,gemini,"“Joie de vivre” means enjoying life, and that’s what the cosmos is encouraging you to do more often. A meeting of the two most optimistic orbs, Jupiter and the Sun, tells you to carve out time for enjoying the people, hobbies and events that put a smile on your face. This includes putting yourself out there and being open to new experiences and connections. You only live once, but of you do it right, that’s all you need.

"
6852,12 february 2017,gemini,"Don’t give up your personal power today, as the planets warn that someone may try to take over a situation or project that you’re involved in. Whoever tries to do so is in for a big surprise, especially after the 18th. That’s when the mighty Sun enters your house of authority and ambition, putting you in the driver’s seat. Then the solar eclipse on the 26th will leave no doubt as to who’s in charge–you.

"
6853,13 february 2017,gemini,"Just how ready are you for jumping in to the “deep end” of life? The Sun and Mercury are both in your house of adventure, encouraging you to dive in. But the emotional Moon is stirring up fears, telling you to stay safe in your little cocoon. Fortunately they’re in a conciliatory mood, willing to reach a compromise. You can take some chances without taking major risks.

"
6854,14 february 2017,gemini,"With the cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, in your house of deep friendship, it’s important to not only have a sizzling sex life with a lover, but to be their best friend as well. Singles, your tribe is the best source of introductions on Valentine’s Day, so head out to a party or restaurant and start mingling. Your sign is the envy of the zodiac considering that the planet of long-term success, Saturn, is in the commitment sector! Today it forms a sparkling aspect with the Sun in the house of optimism and taking chances. Date a new type, or open yourself up and become more vulnerable with a lover.

"
6855,15 february 2017,gemini,"Romance revs up with a happy Moon-Jupiter aspect, but don’t over romanticize a union. It’s critical that you’re realistic about shared goals and values. This holds true also in business, especially when it comes to the overall vision for a project. Your creativity is soaring. However, others may not be too quick to accept your visionary talents. That will change after the Sun enters Pisces on Saturday.

"
6856,16 february 2017,gemini,"There’s an old saying, “Attitude is everything” and truer words were never spoken. You can choose to look at the glass half empty, but under the current positive planetary aspects, chances are you’ll be looking at it as being half full. Your upbeat attitude will be noticed by others, people who might want to travel with you on your journey through life.

"
6857,17 february 2017,gemini,"Duty calls, Gemini. Take some time today or over the weekend to get your chores done and become a heck of a lot more organized. With so much planetary energy going on in the lofty and visionary parts of your chart, you may be more inclined right now to just focus on the big picture. Sorry, but ya gotta tend to the grunt work first.

"
6858,18 february 2017,gemini,"Like a horse at the gate, you’re ready to take off like a shot. The Sun and Mercury have been stirring up your house of adventure and thinking big; now the Sun moves into the place where you can actually make them happen. Over the next four weeks you can make important headway with plans that you’ve been considering for awhile. The best time to launch them? The solar eclipse on the 26th. Start planning now.

"
6859,19 february 2017,gemini,"Now that the Sun is in your career sector, you may be thinking about who can help you make headway with your income and reputation. With the Moon in your partnership house, consider new alliances that will benefit not only you but the other person or group. A strong and positive give-and-take vibe is at play this week.

"
6860,20 february 2017,gemini,"If you’ve been craving more freedom and spontaneity lately, then get ready–the cosmos is getting ready to deliver it to you. Perhaps the boss gives you more creative freedom, or you decide to quit your job to pursue your own enterprise. Maybe you plan a trip to a far off destination that’s been on your bucket list for eons. A romance can take on a more relaxed, exciting atmosphere. Roll with it, Gemini!

"
6861,21 february 2017,gemini,"A new level of closeness can be reached with someone today, thanks to a happy Mercury-Jupiter trine. You may need to let bygones be bygones in order to form a stronger bond, but so be it. Thursday is another good day to make progress.

"
6862,22 february 2017,gemini,"Keep an eye out for bossy types today, as obstinate Mars squares off against power-hungry Pluto. This could occur at the office, in a romantic relationship or even in some kind of group effort, like the PTO. Don’t let this person derail your efforts or those of a team. They’re not above playing head games and pushing emotional buttons, so stay calm and use logic as your weapon.

"
6863,23 february 2017,gemini,"New opportunities are coming your way: socially, in business and for travel and adventure. But you won’t be flying solo, at least not if you want to enjoy these experiences to the fullest. Think about whom you’d like to take along on your journey–and expect to meet some new faces along the way.

"
6864,24 february 2017,gemini,"Major planetary activity is just about ready to take place in your highly ambitious tenth house, but the planets want you to have a really good time before you buckle down and get to work. A happy Moon-Venus trine today tells you to book a vacation, plan an adventure or just make plans to see your pals this weekend. Once next Monday rolls around it’s time to get more serious.

"
6865,25 february 2017,gemini,"Now that Mercury is in your success and ambition sector it’s time to think about where you’re heading in all areas of your life. Mercury is a highly mental planet, fond of analyzing and coming up with smart strategies. Get out a pad of paper and a pen and start brainstorming. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in this part of your chart is the perfect launch opportunity.

"
6866,26 february 2017,gemini,"Sweet success! It’s coming your way, thanks to a solar eclipse in your house of ambition and making things happen. This is the last in a series of eclipses that began back in 2015, so if you’ve been hard at work with any goal of your choosing, you could reap the rewards over the next six months. However, in the days ahead you may need to pull away from people in your circle for some serious focusing.

"
6867,27 february 2017,gemini,"“To thine own self be true.” This is a nice way of saying that from time to time ya just gotta look out for yourself, and that’s OK. If people around you want to be absorbed in theatrics and dilemmas that’s their choice. But you have so much positive planetary energy pushing you to go after  your big dreams that you just can’t waste too much time on unnecessary drama. These folks will just have to figure it out for themselves.

"
6868,28 february 2017,gemini,"The solar eclipse on Sunday has kick started your ambitions, so take this energy and run with it! Yes, you’ll need the help of people along the way, and it’s smart to have confidantes and mentors. But you don’t  need to be engaged in unnecessary drama and time-sucking commitments that aren’t worth it right now. It may not be easy, but some people and activities may need to go.

"
6869,1 march 2017,gemini,"Thinking about which direction to head in with your career? Then the next few days will be highly inspirational. A terrific Sun-Neptune aspect will provide you with fresh ideas and the motivation to run with them. This is a good time to step into your power, by the way, which may mean ignoring the noise coming from friends and family. It’s time to be true to yourself.

"
6870,3 march 2017,gemini,"Passion is wonderful, whether you’re pouring it into your romance, raising your kids, your hobbies or your job. But sometimes you need to dial it down a notch and let cool, rational thought take over. A conflict may be brewing in your mind right now about this, and when Venus retrogrades on Saturday it would be wise to go the rational route. Focus on being objective versus subjective over the next four weeks.

"
6871,4 march 2017,gemini,"Questions may begin to arise about the company you keep now that Venus has gone retrograde in your house of friends and close connections. Sometimes we outgrow our friends; other times we simply realize that they’re coming from a completely different place than we are. The same holds true for lovers, where not being in agreement can create waves. It may be difficult to decipher what’s going on, but things should improve after the 13th.

"
6872,5 march 2017,gemini,"Getting on the same page with someone close should be easier than usual over the next few days thanks to a productive Mars-Saturn meeting. This is especially true in romance, so make an attempt to understand your lover’s viewpoint. Singles are in a good spot to meet someone, with your best luck being at an event. Think book signing, seminar, charity gala, party or trade show.

"
6873,6 march 2017,gemini,"Making progress toward long term goals gets a boost today from an important Sun-Mercury meeting. The entire week is peppered with good aspects, so reach out to decision makers, mentors or people who can help you on your journey. It’s also a smart time to strategize and plan your next steps.

"
6874,7 march 2017,gemini,"Landing a raise, new job or increasing your company’ s revenues are all in the stars for you this week. The only issue today is that you could be too emotional about money, not a good thing if you’re negotiating or considering your options. Don’t sell out or settle for less than you deserve.

"
6875,8 march 2017,gemini,"If you’ve been feeling like a ship on a stormy sea, being tossed around by other people’s attitudes and agendas, you can put a stop to this today—no drama necessary. It’s a matter of owning your power, stepping into it. With intelligent Mercury and the Sun both in your house of authority, you can do so with ease.

"
6876,9 march 2017,gemini,"The planets are setting up a highly cathartic time in which you can release drama and unpleasant memories of the past, Gemini. Energetic Mars moves into your twelfth house of nurturing and healing today, to be followed by a full moon next Sunday in your comfort-driven fourth house. It’s important over the next six weeks to dig down and uncover what personal work needs to be done, especially when it comes to family and love-related issues.

"
6877,10 march 2017,gemini,"The lines of communication open up nicely, not only in romance but in business affairs. You may need to become more involved or authoritative in these matters, standing up for yourself or being the agent of change. The time is now, as Sunday’s full moon falls in your house of feeling emotionally secure and content.

"
6878,11 march 2017,gemini,"With the Sun in the career sector of your chart, this is one of your best times all year to advance. And with lucky, profitable Jupiter in your house of skill and creativity, you have the ability to wow decision makers. But make sure that your skill set is up to snuff. Do you need to take a course, read a book or study with a mentor to become more valuable? Consider new avenues and possibilities.

"
6879,12 march 2017,gemini,"“When you think everything is someone else’s fault, you will suffer a lot. When you realize that everything springs only from yourself, you will learn peace and joy.” This quote from the Dalai Lama sums up the message behind today’s full moon, Gemini. It falls in your house of contentment and emotional security. Even if the people around you are not at peace, you can still learn to remain serene.

"
6880,13 march 2017,gemini,"Time to make some new friends? Now that chatty Mercury is in your house of camaraderie along with Venus, it will be easy to expand your social circle. Volunteer and charitable activities are also favored, so if you want to give back to the community, the animal kingdom or planet Earth now’s a great time to help make a difference.

"
6881,14 march 2017,gemini,"Reality check! You could be so passionate about your beliefs or a project that you simply can’t fathom why others wouldn’t be thrilled with them too. This goes for love, work and friendship. Don’t be surprised if someone laughs at your ideas, calling them impossible or unrealistic. But they’re not, so keep on truckin’.

"
6882,15 march 2017,gemini,"The Sun will be blazing a path through your ambition sector for six more days, and you may already be feeling a bit wiped out from the activity of the last few weeks. Today a healing lunar aspect suggests that you slow down and take a mental health day–or hour! Consider a massage, a yummy home cooked meal, or a night alone with a glass of wine and a good book.

"
6883,16 march 2017,gemini,"Inspiration flows with a stimulating Moon-Neptune connection! While this will help you dream up more innovative solutions at the workplace, you can also use this energy to redecorate a room at home, sculpt your body into a work of art or dive into hobbies that will make your heart sing. Considering that the Sun is about to enter your house of friendship you should buddy up with a pal as you take on new challenges.

"
6884,17 march 2017,gemini,"You may have to tiptoe around a partner over the next few days as a tense angle in the heavens warns against coming on too strong. You’re in quite an authoritative position these days, thanks to the Sun in the most ambitious part of your chart. However, a romantic or business partner may not share your vision, nor your enthusiasm level. You can try forcing your agenda down their throat (which will backfire) or you can wait until next week when working as a team becomes easier.

"
6885,18 march 2017,gemini,"What a weekend to have some fun with the tribe! Chatty, sociable Mercury meets up with magnetic Venus in your house of camaraderie, so schedule cocktails, brunch or a shopping spree. Don’t be surprised, oh single Geminis, if a friend tries to set you up with someone. Even if your pals are busy for the weekend singles should get out there and network, as this is prime time for meeting someone new.

"
6886,19 march 2017,gemini,"Your relationships with people are the focus of the cosmos over the next two weeks. Today, serious Saturn asks you to examine close business and romantic ties. Are you coming from the same place? Once the Sun enters Aries tomorrow you’ll be meeting new people, some of whom will be in your life for years to come. Is it time to cut some old ties in order to create new ones?

"
6887,20 march 2017,gemini,"Working closely with other people will become quite important over the next four weeks, Gemini. The Sun glides into Aries today, your eleventh house of camaraderie and networking. You’ll be able to make some new friends, get involved in charity work and perhaps be asked to join a cutting edge team at work. It won’t be easy going everyday, however; you’ll experience times when you have to suck it up and cooperate with people who are difficult. But the end result will be worth it.

"
6888,21 march 2017,gemini,"You could encounter some kind of friction today, especially in the area of personal relationships. Someone may be trying to make you feel guilty or push your buttons, which could really make you emotional. With the Moon in the part of your chart that governs your psychological depth, though, you also have the opportunity to see this for what it is—then let it go.

"
6889,22 march 2017,gemini,"If you need to get something off your chest today is a good time to do so. The planets are acting up tomorrow and Friday, so either speak now or hold your piece until next week. Friends can be a good source of solace and advice today, and then again at the time of the new moon on the 28th.

"
6890,23 march 2017,gemini,"Watch out for the green-eyed monster, especially among your friends or colleagues—or within you! Envying other people for what appears to be their “fabulous life” won’t help improve your own. If you’re at the receiving end of someone’s jealousy (and the remarks and looks that may come with it), let it go. And get used to it. You have more good stuff coming your way and you deserve to enjoy it.

"
6891,24 march 2017,gemini,"Optimism can be a beautiful thing. After all, would you rather be around a gloomy pessimist or someone who’s looking at the brighter side of life? But the planets may shake your optimism with a tense Jupiter-Mercury square. This could be most apparent in the areas of love and friendship. You may start to question an alliance, wondering if it’s secure or if you want to remain in it. The new moon next Tuesday will help you get a clearer picture.

"
6892,25 march 2017,gemini,"The people you know—as well as the people you haven’t met yet—are going to play a big part in your life in the weeks ahead, Gemini. Be open to making new acquaintances and business contacts. Consider joining some kind of a team, whether it’s a golf league, charity or industry think tank. Today is perfect for mingling—especially if you’re looking for love!

"
6893,26 march 2017,gemini,"Your career can get a big jolt forward thanks to two terrific aspects in the heavens. The first one encourages you to join forces with others as collaborations are your key to future success. If you’re not part of a team at the office, is there one you can join? If not (or the people aren’t cutting edge thinkers) is there an industry meeting or group you can attend? The second aspect, a Mars-Neptune sextile, tells you that inspiration can flow your way with (yes, I’m serious) meditation. Hey, that’s how Jack Canfield came up with the name for his book, Chicken Soup for the Soul.

"
6894,27 march 2017,gemini,"Got love on your mind? You should be considering that the emotional Moon is sidled up next to romantic Venus in the heavens. If you’re looking for amour, head out to where people gather: a party, seminar, book signing, industry event or convention. This is the most auspicious way to land a new mate. Attached? Then start planning more nights out instead of in, and go the group route instead of just the two of you. There is quite a convivial air encouraging you to mingle.

"
6895,28 march 2017,gemini,"A much more social season swings into place for you Gemini, thanks to the new moon in the most outgoing part of your chart. The next six months are no time to sit at home in front of the TV. Get out there and network, as the connections you make will play big part in your overall happiness level and success. A pal could play matchmaker or tip you off about a job. Becoming part of a volunteer effort will bring gratification. Hanging out with people who share your hobbies and interests can be a heck of a lot of fun. What are you waiting for?

"
6896,29 march 2017,gemini,"Teaming up with others can really work in your favor over the next few weeks and months, thanks to yesterday’s new moon in your networking sector. A superb Mercury-Saturn trine today tells you to start reaching out to others. This could be for a neighborhood association, charity, planning a family reunion, creating an industry think tank or any other purpose. While the road ahead won’t be completely smooth, you’ll still travel farther if you take others with you on your journey.

"
6897,30 march 2017,gemini,"Power struggles may erupt within a romantic relationship or some kind of work project. It appears from your chart that the overall direction that things are heading in is a point of contention. Not only that, someone may try to grab the reins and take control—which will only lead to more problems. To be honest, the power player could be you, so think twice before you start pushing others around.

"
6898,31 march 2017,gemini,"Dig deep, Gemini! Intelligent Mercury enters the house that governs your subconscious mind, joining energetic Mars. This is one heck of a time to take out the toxic trash and replace it with more positive thought patterns, not to mention getting in touch with a deeper, more metaphysical side of yourself. Your artistic talents can also flow as the doors to your skill base open up wide.

"
6899,1 april 2017,gemini,"Do you truly love what you do for a living? If not, you’re about to get a wakeup call as Venus begins to backslide into your career house tomorrow. The good news is that this will give you the opportunity to get in touch with your true self, the wise voice that knows what will make your heart sing. Consider your options between the 2nd and the 15th, then get ready to make changes mid-April.

"
6900,2 april 2017,gemini,"A little shameless self-promotion could go a long way between now and the middle of the month. With Magnetic Venus sliding backward into your career and goals sector today, reach out to decision makers and toot your own horn. Sometimes people need a reminder as to just how talented you are. Give them a gentle wakeup call.

"
6901,3 april 2017,gemini,"Got a great idea? Then showcase it—to a boss, client, investor or any other key decision maker. But the planets suggest that you fly solo on this venture. If you try to work with a group, you might be dealing with idea-stealers or malcontents who won’t play nice. You’re the one with the smarts: use that to your  advantage, not someone else’s.

"
6902,4 april 2017,gemini,"The green eyed monster might raise its jealous little head today with a Moon-Saturn square. Envy may take hold as you eye a friend who seems to have it all; or perhaps a pal is giving you the resentful looks! But not to worry. Next week’s full moon will help you close out this chapter and enjoy life a heck of a lot more.

"
6903,5 april 2017,gemini,"If you need to discuss something with a boss or key client, now’s the time to do so. A helpful Moon- Neptune aspect is suitable for getting things out there. Planetary influences indicate that you may need to switch up the manner in which you communicate, though, so keep this in mind. Perhaps you need to be more direct or creative. Maybe you should aspire to be more diplomatic. Try new approaches until you get it right.

"
6904,6 april 2017,gemini,"Let’s get serious! That may be your battle cry as Saturn retrogrades in your sector of partnering up. This includes romantic alliances as well as business ones. Would your career benefit from hiring an agent, manager or stylist? Is it time to stop dating divas and bad boys and finally settle down? Maybe you need to hold some mature convos with an existing partner. Between now and September you can solidify your union.

"
6905,7 april 2017,gemini,"Just how badly do you want to fit in—with the crowd, your family, a relationship? Giving up your own sense of individuality may exact a price from you, Gemini. There is no shortage of people around you who would prefer it if you did things their way. Indeed, you may even feel envious of them. But think before you commit to following someone else’s path.

"
6906,8 april 2017,gemini,"If you feel as though others are clipping your wings, you can blame it on two stinky squares today that pit you against close connections. From your chart it appears that people in your world (friends, co-workers, a lover) are putting their own needs first, to the point where you are feeling burdened by their demands. Diplomatically extracting yourself from the situation may be tricky, but it could also be the best way to maintain your sanity and serenity.

"
6907,9 april 2017,gemini,"Who’s got your back? Chances are you’ll find out, now that Mercury is in your house of secrets and hidden matters. Between now and the 20th you’ll need to rely on logic just as much as your gut, as Mercury’s retro spin could create fuzzy thinking. Friends and lovers will be in the spotlight over the next week. Make sure that you share the same values and that you’re in agreement over key issues.

"
6908,10 april 2017,gemini,"Someone close may be burdened with a problem and could look to you for help. While they may not take your advice seriously right now, you’ve done your part by listening and providing them with input. Your words will make sense to them later this month.

"
6909,11 april 2017,gemini,"Your emotions could be flowing like wine thanks to the full moon in the dramatic fifth house of romance and living la vida loca. Problem is, they could flow a bit too much thanks to a Jupiter-Pluto square. Don’t assume that everyone around you, which includes friends as well as a lover, is on the same page as you. If you allow your feelings to show too much there could be repercussions. Wait until the weekend for a more rational time to express your ideas and feelings.

"
6910,12 april 2017,gemini,"With inspirational Neptune in your house of ambition, you should have no shortage of bright ideas. But watch that you don’t get carried away with them or take on too many new projects at once. You’ll soon realize that you’ve overlooked some details or that you need more information before you can charge forward.

"
6911,13 april 2017,gemini,"Playing by the rules may not always be fun but cutting corners–and then dealing with the subsequent fallout–is far worse. Stick to protocols and mind the fine points. Your life is about to become busier with new projects and activities. Make sure the things you’re already working on are all buttoned up.

"
6912,14 april 2017,gemini,"Absolute genius! Uranus, the planet of innovation and brainstorms, is sparking some pretty awesome thoughts in your mind. Not only that, a strong angle to the Sun indicates that you’ll have the mojo to act on them too. Right now your best bet is to find like minded people to make things happen rather than flying solo. Seek a mentor, attend a seminar or buddy up with folks who are forward thinkers too.

"
6913,15 april 2017,gemini,"Finding common ground with the people closest to you should get easier now that Venus has stationed direct. For the past month it’s been retrograde, creating confusion in love or career matters. You may have been unsure which direction to head in while friction existed with others. Now you can create forward momentum, although once the Sun enters Taurus next week you may decide to work on some projects by yourself.

"
6914,16 april 2017,gemini,"Confidence is sexy, and you should be showing off what you’ve got! Lusty Mars and charismatic Venus meet in the heavens, encouraging you to put your best foot forward. This is true not only in romance but your career and other ambitions as well. Just be sure to maintain a little mystery about you considering that Mars is in the hush-hush house of seclusion.

"
6915,17 april 2017,gemini,"Where is this relationship going? Serious talks can take place as two of the most straightforward orbs in the solar system meet up in a helpful trine. The Sun and Saturn are determined to bring longevity to a union, whether it’s a business relationship or a romantic one. But don’t rush things. With the Sun about to enter the most secluded part of your chart, you need time to think things over.

"
6916,18 april 2017,gemini,"Start taking more control over your financial situation rather than letting others run the show, or worse….the fickle hand of fate! Consider yourself as the captain of the good ship Lots o’  Wealth, and steer that vessel down the best channel for pocketing more money. Whether you should go the safe route or take a risk is to early to tell. When Pluto retrogrades in this sector on Thursday, you’ll have through late September to figure things out.

"
6917,19 april 2017,gemini,"Of all the signs of the zodiac you will be the most reflective over the next four weeks, Gemini. In part it’s due to the Sun moving into the most secluded, quiet part of your chart, the place where you heal old wounds and release the past. But Pluto and Mercury retrograde the next day, adding to this sense of cocooning. Your closest relationships, with a lover and friends, will be the focus.

"
6918,20 april 2017,gemini,"Sometimes you just gotta let the past go, and now is one of those times. Old hurts, feelings of resentment, jealousy and grudges need to be 86’d as Pluto retrogrades in one of the deepest, most emotional parts of your chart. It will be back stroking through the heavens until late September, so take this valuable time to process your feelings. It’s not always easy to do this kind of mental cleansing but the results will be worth it. Meditation, spending more time in nature and learning more about different philosophies (such as Buddhism or Tao) could be enormously helpful.

"
6919,21 april 2017,gemini,"Woo-hoo! Energetic, lusty Mars is now in Gemini, a place it hasn’t visited in two years. You can move mountains over the next few months, going after just about any goal or passion that’s on your mind. But with four planets retrograde—three of which are in houses that deal with the people closest to you—you may face resistance from them. Or, you might hold back out of fear; “what will they think?” This is your time, Gemini. You’ll be able to get people on your side after Venus changes signs on the 28th.

"
6920,22 april 2017,gemini,"Trying to sweet talk someone into doing what you want will backfire today, so don’t even think about it. If you need to get your point across—to a child, boss, lover or family member—your best bet is to be as straightforward as possible. Back up your statements with facts, not emotions, and let time pass so that your words have the chance to sink in. Next week is a much better time to push your agenda.

"
6921,23 april 2017,gemini,"Confidence is sexy and you should be brimming with it today, Gemini! A sexy meet up of Venus and the Moon in the take-charge part of your chart takes you from being a wallflower to a hothouse orchid. And with red hot, lusty Mars now in your sign, your charisma factor is high. Work it, honey.

"
6922,24 april 2017,gemini,"Two heads are better than one! Teaming up with a other individual (or a group) is the best way to make progress these days. The cosmos is urging you to consider the benefits of forming an alliance–to help make improvements in your neighborhood or school, to take your business revenues to a higher level, or to gain the expert advice of a mentor on any topic of your choosing. Talks that start today will continue into next week. All that counts today is to get the ball rolling.

"
6923,25 april 2017,gemini,"A major chapter of your life is about to close in a good way, thanks to the upcoming new moon in your house of endings and renewal. A sudden realization may hit you that you need to revise your game plan for the year ahead, as some of your goals or dreams have changed. Over the next few weeks you’ll be able to really get clear as to what you want to manifest, and who will be traveling with you on this journey.

"
6924,26 april 2017,gemini,"Heal thyself! The new moon in your cathartic twelfth house urges you to start taking better care of your tired body and mind. Set appointments to talk with health care professionals, such as a doctor, nutritionist or physical therapist. The same holds true for counselors who can assist you in eliminating past traumas or bad habits that have been difficult to release. With Venus about to enter your house of connecting with others, this isn’t a journey that you’ll be traveling solo. Hook up with an exercise buddy, join a bereavement group or head to a metaphysical shop to learn how to become more mindful.

"
6925,27 april 2017,gemini,"Intense emotions may be bubbling to the surface of your psyche thanks to yesterday’s new moon, and today is a good time to start dealing with them. Specifically, how you handle your own personal power—and threats to it—are the focus. So where are you giving your power away, or to whom? Bad habits? Getting manipulated by a lover or family members? Falling prey to workplace negativity? Identify, then make changes.

"
6926,28 april 2017,gemini,"Group dynamics begin to shift as easy going Venus enters this sector, its second visit here this year. And it may not be because other people are changing. You  may become more tolerant of co-workers, friends or others who are on your team, such as a volunteer group. The recent new moon fell in your psychological sector, imbuing you with wisdom. Sometimes it’s best to not engage in the theatrics that others want to stir up.

"
6927,29 april 2017,gemini,"You may be reminded about your obligations to other people this weekend, something that may not sit well with you. With the Moon in Gemini you just want to have some down time for yourself. It may have to wait a few days, but fear not—the recent new moon in Taurus was custom made for doing some pampering and relaxing. Book an appointment for a massage or another self-indulgent session for later next week.

"
6928,30 april 2017,gemini,"One door closes, another opens as the recent new moon fell in your house of closure. The next few months are excellent for bringing positive new circumstances into your life, which includes earning more. A stellar Moon-Sun aspect today can help you brainstorm or research ideas that may be percolating in your brain. Don’t dismiss them; they could be winners.

"
6929,1 may 2017,gemini,"Someone in your circle, whether it’s a friend or a co-worker, could act out in a way that catches you off guard. Mercury has been retrograde in your house of networking for some time now, so you may already have witnessed some wonky behavior from someone. Your best bet is to let it pass. Mercury resumes direct motion on Wednesday, at which time you’ll be able to speak with them in a more rational manner.

"
6930,2 may 2017,gemini,"Charisma and magnetism: you’ve got ‘em in spades, Gemini, thanks to red hot Mars in your sign! Use that charm to win people over today—a lover, potential client, new boss, banker, neighbor, family member, you name it. Mars forms a sparkling aspect with the Moon in gregarious Leo, permitting you to sell ice cream to Eskimos.

"
6931,3 may 2017,gemini,"It’s 5 o’clock somewhere! Which means that it’s time for cocktails, networking, a little gossip, planning world domination and all of the other things that go on when folks get together. Chatty little Mercury goes direct in your social eleventh house of networking, helping you schmooze with business contacts, friends and lovers (and those potential mates in your crosshairs). Get out there and enjoy it, because some of these connections will take you far.

"
6932,4 may 2017,gemini,"Your dreams of a happy home life may hit a few snags as Venus asks you to revise some of your plans. Perhaps you have to hold off on conceiving a baby, at least until you save more money. The same situation may ring true for a house purchase. A parent may need your help, pulling you away from your kids or personal time that you’d like to enjoy. June is a much better month for moving forward with your plans.

"
6933,5 may 2017,gemini,"What do you really expect from a love partner or from romance in general, Gemini? That’s the question the cosmos poses to you today. Are you waiting for someone to rescue you? Are you letting fears and disappointment from the past color your current view? Harboring a crush on someone who’s unavailable? Get real and come to terms with any unrealistic terms or attitudes you may be holding on to.

"
6934,6 may 2017,gemini,"If you need more emotional support from the people closest to you, by all means let them know. The Sun is in the most healing part of your chart, encouraging you to release negativity. This includes the demands and expectations placed upon you by loved ones. It’s a two-way street, Gemini. Just as they have needs so do you.

"
6935,7 may 2017,gemini,"Inspirational Neptune is in a good mood, telling you to take a more creative approach to life. Your mind might immediately go to the way you dress or wear your hair, maybe your home decor or the dishes you cook. But it’s more than that. This also includes your occupation and the way you go about your business day. Start thinking out of the box.

"
6936,8 may 2017,gemini,"There’s a lot of planetary activity this week in the part of your chart that deals with your most cherished dreams, and today they will be in sharp focus. The issue at hand is that what you  want and what other people may have in mind are two different things. Another problem may be jealousy on your part, as you eye the goodies that other people have and demand to know when the hell it’s going to be your turn. Well, tomorrow maybe, as a super Sun-Pluto aspect puts you in the driver’s seat.

"
6937,9 may 2017,gemini,"An interesting day lies ahead as two of the most powerful orbs in our solar system, the Sun and Pluto, form a terrific aspect in the make-your-dreams-a reality sectors. This is a very mental vibe, encouraging you to think deeply about what you want. Furthermore, what negative emotions or situations do you need to clear out before you can move ahead? The full moon on Wednesday takes you from the thinking stage to the planning stage.

"
6938,11 may 2017,gemini,"Collaborations with others may be the best way to increase your net worth, Gemini. A spontaneous meeting of intelligent Mercury and brilliant Uranus could bring in people who want to work with you, and from the looks of your chart some serious money could be made. Likewise, you may be interested in finding a mentor, coach or partner whose expertise could help take yours to a higher level. With the Sun in the most secretive part of your chart, though, be sure to keep convos on the downlow.

"
6939,12 may 2017,gemini,"Yee-ha! Looks like Gemini is ready to have some fun, and we’re not talking about the usual stuff. Hell no, energetic Mars trines optimistic Jupiter, pushing you to bust out of an old groove and seize control of your future. For what it’s worth Jupiter is in your house of romance, art, culture, sports and living la vida loca. If you’ve got a mental list of things you intend to do “someday”….well Skippy, someday is here. What are you waiting for?

"
6940,13 may 2017,gemini,"Your ideas about what makes for long term success and happiness in love may be changing, Gemini. Maybe you realize that you’re perfectly happy just living with someone and you don’t need to marry. Perhaps your tastes are evolving, and your ideal mate is a completely different type than before. It may hit you that you don’t have to put up with certain behaviors, and that you’re done  with drama. Maybe a less flashy and more soulful mate is the best person for you. There is great wisdom in that mind of yours, Gemini—tap into it.

"
6941,14 may 2017,gemini,"If you’ve felt stuck, unable to find the solution to an issue that has been on your mind, help is on the way. Intelligent Mercury will enter the intuitive part of your chart on Tuesday for a three-week stay, so you can expect some innovative breakthroughs to come your way. But today has excellent aspects that can help you too, especially in matters of the heart and career. The key word these days is “creativity”. If you do things the same way you’ve always done them, you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.

"
6942,15 may 2017,gemini,"Ggrrrr!  Someone’s feeling frisky. A sexy meet up of the amorous Moon and subterranean Pluto will fire up not only your libido, but your desire to bond with another on a more intimate mental level too. And when Pluto is around, you won’t be interested in settling for table scraps in the boudoir or your love life, if you get my drift. So make some demands. Chains and whips optional.

"
6943,16 may 2017,gemini,"An important transition time begins today as brainy Mercury enters one of the most reflective parts of your chart, where it will remain for a few weeks. Yes, your birthday season is almost here but with Mercury in this sector you should do some quiet thinking about your life before heading down a new path. This is a time for rest, solitude and even meditation. Balancing your rational mind with intuitive vibes may be a bit of a challenge, but it’s important to pay attention to both.

"
6944,17 may 2017,gemini,"The Moon in friendly Aquarius is pleading with you to make things right with a lover or your kids, or even co-workers with whom you’re experiencing “creative differences”. Considering that La Luna is forming a super angle with lucky Jupiter, you should have no problem. It’s important to do this now, because Friday brings a difficult aspect in which your needs and ideas will be pitted against theirs.

"
6945,18 may 2017,gemini,"Feel like finding a cabin in the woods a la  Henry Thoreau and hiding out for awhile? It wouldn’t be surprising if you did. A tense Venus-Jupiter aspect could find friends and lovers determined to push your buttons, to the point where you say, “Enough!”. Maybe pals are meddling in your love life. Perhaps one of these folks is jealous or demanding. If you need some down time, take it. The new moon next week is in your sign, putting your needs first.

"
6946,19 may 2017,gemini,"Every once in a while the cosmos sends up an aspect that is designed to shake up our view about a situation, and today is one of those days. Rule breaker Uranus challenges tried-and-true Saturn (in a nice way, mind you!), asking you to rethink the “rules” that you may have concerning friends and lovers. Are you too particular—or way too flexible, letting anyone  into your life? In love, are you doggedly pursuing a type, not willing to bend from that ideal? Maybe you need to socialize more, or get involved in a charitable organization. This aspect repeats again in November, so get ready—your opinions about people are going to change dramatically.

"
6947,20 may 2017,gemini,"Walk over to the mirror and kiss yourself on the lips, Gemini—your birthday season is officially here! This year will be different from 2016 in that red hot Mars, the ambitious planet that knows how to get things done, is also in your sign right now. The good news is that this can make you unstoppable; the downside is that you may become so  anxious to see progress that you’ll mow people over or burn out from exertion. So slow your roll, but not too much: the new moon next Thursday is the perfect time to kick off your plans.

"
6948,21 may 2017,gemini,"Teaming up with new people is a strong possibility this week, and the cosmos urges you to get out there and mingle. Today and tomorrow are super for schmoozing, whether you’re trying to meet a soulmate, find a new job or meet parents in the neighborhood who have kids the same age as yours. The new moon in Gemini on Thursday opens up all sorts of possibilities for you, so it makes sense to have other people along on your journey.

"
6949,22 may 2017,gemini,"Your friends will count for a lot over the next week, Gemini, perhaps even more than a lover or family. Today’s a good time to reach out to a trusted confidante if you need to unload or just relax and unwind. This holds true for talking to a mentor or a wise person who can help you with business matters. In the end you’ll have to make your own decisions, but that should be easy with a new moon in your sign this Thursday.

"
6950,23 may 2017,gemini,"With Thursday’s new moon falling in your  sign, birthday girl or guy, you may be feeling mighty ambitious. And so you should! This annual event is the cosmos’s gift to you to start over. But you need to take your time, as a stern Saturn-Mars opposition could be making you over anxious. This planetary energy is building and reaches its most powerful level on the 29th. So take a deep breath, count to ten, and plot the year ahead. Think “tortoise” instead of “hare”.

"
6951,24 may 2017,gemini,"Hush! Don’t spill secrets today or confide in people whom you’re not 100% sure have your back. According to the planets there are some interesting things going on in your life, and a happy lunar aspect encourages you to go after them. But a brewing Venus-Pluto square warns against sharing too much. Even if your friends or colleagues feel as though they are entitled  to hear the scoop, that’s not the case. You don’t owe them anything.

"
6952,25 may 2017,gemini,"The cosmos delivers your annual birthday gift: a glittering new moon in your sign! Over the next six months you can make a lot of progress with dreams that are important to you. However, make sure that your dreams are just that: yours.  Chasing after goals to keep up with your friends, or to have the most happening Facebook page isn’t what it’s all about. Be true to yourself.

"
6953,26 may 2017,gemini,"Relationships with others may have been tricky lately, especially with friends, colleagues and team members. With sweet Venus in your camaraderie sector you may end up being the peace maker, whether you want to or not! Your powers of persuasion are excellent with assertive Mars in your chatty third house. Next Tuesday is an excellent day to get everyone back on the same team—or page.

"
6954,27 may 2017,gemini,"The recent new moon in your sign opens up a two-week window in which you can really get clear on what you’d like to achieve. If you apply yourself over the next six months progress can be made. This weekend is super for talking to friends who can act as a sounding board for your ideas. Finding a mentor who is savvy about the areas you want to go into is a smart move too. Why reinvent the wheel when someone can tell you how to get things done more quickly?

"
6955,28 may 2017,gemini,"Some “hidden” information could come your way over the next few days that will put you in an advantageous situation. It could be a scoop that someone confides or maybe a gut feeling that you have, but either way you stand to benefit from it. Take your time before you act, as there should be more tidbits of information coming your way over the next week.

"
6956,29 may 2017,gemini,"Slow your roll, Gemini! Impatient Mars has been in your sign for some time now, making you determined to get things done. But don’t move so quickly that you make a major mistake, quite the possibility these days as mature and logical Saturn opposes Mars. It’s also possible that someone close may be making you feel hemmed in, and if that’s the case, you may need to put some space between the two of you.

"
6957,30 may 2017,gemini,"Megawatt Mars is in your house of self, which not deals with your image but also some of the big plans you’d like to kick off over this new birthday year. Problem is, you may be going in too many directions, unsure which options to pick or whether you have the chops to pull them off. An unexpected meeting or conversation with someone could be just the remedy, as the cosmos is trying to help you connect with a mentor or friend with sage advice.

"
6958,31 may 2017,gemini,"Listening to your inner voice is the way to go as intelligent Mercury is in your house of hidden wisdom. Sometimes you need to clear out some mental cobwebs before you can hear the truth and power that’s tucked away, but with strong man Pluto helping you out, you should have no problem.

"
6959,1 june 2017,gemini,"You’re a friendly sign by nature, and with so much planetary activity in the interpersonal parts of your chart you should be even more of a social butterfly these days. A rockin’ Saturn aspect could bring in new faces that could be in your life for years to come— a potential lover, new pal or business colleagues. Better yet is that your ties with existing people can become even stronger. A friend could suggest entering into a business partnership, for example, or a person who’s just been an acquaintance could become a close confidante.

"
6960,1 june 2016,gemini,"The Sun in your sign is firing you up to go after big dreams and passion projects, but today you come up against some opposition from someone who wants to wear the pants. It could be a boss, a lover, a parent or colleague who’s trying to pull rank, but either way, they may try to stand in your way. Problem is, they may play the passive-aggressive game and you won’t be sure what to believe. Keep calm and carry on. Mercury in your house of intuition will help you separate the BS from reality.

"
6961,2 june 2017,gemini,"Yeah, baby! The sparkling Sun winks at happy-go-lucky Jupiter in what should be one go the most upbeat days of the year. This is a super aspect for finding new love, developing a deeper bond with your amour or conceiving a baby. But there’s another side to this aspect, and that’s really going within and becoming the most authentic “you” possible. Dare to be more creative in the way you approach life.

"
6962,2 june 2016,gemini,"Inspiration is heading your way, Gemini, and you can thank the Moon and Neptune for any bright ideas that pop into your mind! They are determined to help you find solutions to career issues especially. Got a problem client you need to calm down? Working on a new product line and feel stymied by the slow progress? Writing a book or a screenplay? Get ready for forward momentum.

"
6963,3 june 2017,gemini,"Sudden changes could occur with close connections as erratic Uranus creates minor earthquakes. There are two sides to this: your lover takes you away for the weekend on an unplanned romantic holiday. A friend matches you up with a soulful new potential mate. An old friend calls and suggests drinks, someone you haven’t heard from in ages. But on the flip side, you realize you’ve had enough go a frenemy’s behavior and cut the cord. A lover won’t commit to the same long term plans as you and you realize that a decision needs to be made. Wait until Mercury enters your sign on Tuesday to make a decision.

"
6964,4 june 2017,gemini,"I want, I want! That’s the new battle cry as assertive Mars barrels into your money and security conscious second house. Building income streams and padding your savings account could be the result if you take this energy and work with it wisely. Gaining more guarantees about a romantic union is also in the stars. However, don’t be so impatient to get ahead that you enter into risky financial ventures or spend too much. Likewise, don’t push a lover into making decisions just because your clock is ticking like an atomic bomb ready to detonate.

"
6965,5 june 2017,gemini,"You may need to step back from your goals and dreams today for a reality check. From your chart it appears that your mind is adrift at sea with unrealistic deadlines or strategies that aren’t fully fleshed out. You may also be indulging in fantasies, so it’s time to snap out of it. When Venus enters the house of your subconscious mind tomorrow you’ll be able to intuit the next best step.

"
6966,6 june 2017,gemini,"Slow your roll, Gemini! Magnetic Venus, planet of ease, is urging you to take things one moment at a time. It’s called mindfulness, and you can benefit enormously by learning more about it. No matter how much you worry and fret, things will unfold at their own pace. Fortunately practical Mercury enters your sign today, helping you see situations and people for what they are.

"
6967,7 june 2017,gemini,"It’s been your birthday season for some time now, but today the cosmos delivers a nice gift in your lap: the movement of Mercury into Gemini. If you’ve been holding back from expressing your feelings or ideas, now’s the time to speak up. Mercury is the planet of rational thought and strategic planning, but that’s not the only trick you have up your sleeve. Yesterday Venus entered your house of intuition, so between your brain and your gut there will be no shortage of inspiration and wisdom.

"
6968,8 june 2017,gemini,"Creativity can’t be rushed or forced, Gemini. The right side of our brain, the place that allows talent to flow, likes to operate without a sense of time and watching the clock. You’re in a superb spot today to readjust the way you’re going about a project that requires a good deal of inspiration. A sparkling Jupiter-Neptune aspect bodes well for this, whether you’re redecorating the living room, writing a manuscript or developing your brand.

"
6969,9 june 2017,gemini,"Wow! It’s a big day for Geminis as there are not one, but two positive aspects that heat up your love life. First, Jupiter resumes direct motion in your fifth house of romance. Finding new love or spending more time with your amour are all possible now after a four-month slowdown. Better yet, there’s a full moon in your commitment sector, indicating that many Geminis are more than ready to take the next big step. With serious, mature Saturn in a good angle your decisions should be sound.

"
6970,10 june 2017,gemini,"Life should start looking a lot more pleasant now that abundant, optimistic Jupiter is moving direct in your house of enjoying life’s goodies (which includes love, dontcha know). This house is also the sector of creativity, so if you’re in a line of work (or want to be) that’s on the more artistic side, you have between now and October 10th to really log some studio time and make your mark. But this also includes getting back in touch with hobbies or sports that you used to enjoy, as well as diving in to new ones.

"
6971,11 june 2017,gemini,"It’s a good day to team up with others as spontaneous Uranus is active in your house of friends and networking. Go out to brunch with the tribe, plan a golf game, go to a hobby convention or get involved with a charity. There’s an air of the unexpected happening today; who knows whom you might meet!

"
6972,12 june 2017,gemini,"Getting on the same page with others, especially when it comes to a creative direction, becomes easy today thanks to a helpful Mercury-Jupiter trine. This could mean agreeing with your spouse about redecorating the living room or creating a baby together. A team at the office may put aside their squabbling and approve the way a project should be handled. Creatives can really come up with some terrific new ideas to pursue. Inspiration is running high, so roll with it.

"
6973,13 june 2017,gemini,"Feel like you’re getting the runaround from someone in a position of authority? It could be, courtesy of a stinky Neptune-Mercury square. Don’t expect the boss, government officials or a judge to provide clarity today: it may be just the opposite. Wait a bit, but not too long—Neptune retrogrades on Friday. Try to get an answer before then.

"
6974,14 june 2017,gemini,"Try to discuss long term plans or important issues with a lover or business partner today, if all possible. A difficult Sun-Saturn opposition tomorrow could make you feel as though your needs aren’t being met—which is why you need to voice your opinion right now.

"
6975,15 june 2017,gemini,"Is someone else running your life? With the Sun in your sign, Gemini, you should be the captain of your own ship. But if that’s not the case, resentment could build today due to a Sun-Saturn opposition. It’s one thing to be in a partnership, friendship or family relationship, and another to be someone’s doormat. Make sure that your needs are being met.

"
6976,17 june 2017,gemini,"Follow your bliss? If you current gig isn’t making your heart sing, it may be time for a change. A Moon-Chiron aspect tells you that it’s not your karma to stay in a dead end job or an industry that no longer appeals to you. Now that Neptune is retrograde in your ambition sector you can reflect upon what you’d really like to do.

"
6977,18 june 2017,gemini,"An opportunity may arise to join a group or to meet new people, and from your chart it appears that this will seemingly come from out of the blue.

7062,4 august 2016,gemini,"As the Moon and Venus head into Virgo, you’re going to be ready to tackle home-related matters, whether it’s finding a new place to live or fixing up your place. Problem is that a partner may not share your zest for new duvet covers or relocating. It may also be that you can’t agree on how to handle an issue with kids or other family members. Things could reach critical mass over the weekend, so let it pass. Next Wednesday is a far better time for making progress.

"
7063,5 august 2017,gemini,"A little creative thinking will take you far, especially at the office. With inspirational Neptune in a good spot, you should be taking advantage of ideas that come your way. Likewise, brainstorm with others as two heads are definitely better than one.

"
7064,5 august 2016,gemini,"Sl-o-o-o-w down there, pardner! Venus enters your domestic sector today, making you anxious to see forward movement in a romantic relationship: finding a new one, cohabitating, buying a place, starting a family, deeper commitment. But tense angles coming from Mars and Saturn warn that you’re moving too fast. Once Saturn goes direct on the 13th things will develop momentum.

"
7065,6 august 2017,gemini,"Feel like you’re stuck between a rock and a hard place? With the emotional Moon getting battered by Jupiter and Uranus, you may feel that you can’t keep anyone happy. Let it pass. Once the lunar eclipse occurs on Monday, you’ll be far too absorbed in your own exciting plans to worry about other peoples’ agendas.

"
7066,6 august 2016,gemini,"Time out! It may be necessary to take one this weekend when it comes to relationships. One of you may be coming on too strong, making the other feel rushed or controlled. Words and feelings could easily be misconstrued. It’s also possible that everything is fine with your romance, but family members are sticking their noses where they don’t belong. This is not  the time to make a decision about anything major. Wait til Wednesday’s positive Mercury-Pluto trine.

"
7067,7 august 2017,gemini,"If any of your major plans have been stalled, or you’ve been trying to figure out which direction to go in, then relief is on the way–tonight’s lunar eclipse in Aquarius starts to shake things loose. A terrific Mars influence will give you the ability to figure out the small steps to take, those that will lead you to the big enchilada.

"
7068,7 august 2016,gemini,"It’s your head versus your heart today with an opposition occurring between Mercury and Neptune. Someone close may be throwing their weight around, trying to take control of a situation under the appearance that they’re trying to do you a favor. But are they really? Wait a few days before coming to any conclusions.

"
7069,8 august 2017,gemini,"You’re ready to launch some big plans, thanks to yesterday’s eclipse in the most optimistic and visionary part of your chart. And today an unexpected development could arise as someone could appear on the scene to help you: a mentor, potential business partner, lover, friend or even a new group that can take your plans from the dream state to reality.

"
7070,8 august 2016,gemini,"Setting boundaries and limits with people in your circle is necessary, Gemini. The planets warn that otherwise, you’ll be hopping to and fro as you try to keep up with their demands. Neptune in your house of authority may make you uneasy or unwilling to lay down the law, but consider what your life will be like if you don’t.

"
7071,9 august 2017,gemini,"It’s a smart time to gain control over a financial matter, whether it’s managing your retirement account, dealing with bills from your health care provider or going after your ex for past due child support. With the two most authoritative orbs by your side, the Sun and Pluto, you’ll be able to get your point across without bashing somebody’s head in.

"
7072,9 august 2016,gemini,"The Olympics are in full swing in Brazil, and we can all witness the results of the hard work put in by the athletes. Their ability isn’t due to genetics but discipline–slogging through the same routine with dedication, day after day. A positive Moon-Venus aspect encourages you to develop some new habits and routines that will make you life hum along like a well-oiled machine.

"
7073,10 august 2017,gemini,"This is a superb time for strategizing and brainstorming, so gather the troops and plot your next conquest. Creativity will be running high thanks to inspirational Neptune in a good spot– and your motivation will be operating at full throttle too.

"
7074,10 august 2016,gemini,"You can try to develop greater peace of mind by meditating and practicing mindfulness, both of which are recommended by Pluto’s strong position in the emotional wellbeing part of your chart. But it also seems that having a conversation with someone is necessary in order for you to feel truly at ease. Get your feelings out there to the people who count.

"
7075,11 august 2017,gemini,"The recent lunar eclipse is pushing you to take some chances in life. But over the next three weeks you may pull back, afraid to stick your neck out. Why? Mercury retrogrades in your comfort-driven fourth house, the place where we seek security. You may also be concerned that you’ll take on more than you can handle. Fear not, Gemini–you’ll be able to pull it off without taking undue risk.

"
7076,11 august 2016,gemini,"Emotions could be riding high in a romantic relationship, thanks to the sensitive Moon setting off critical angles with Mars and Saturn in your commitment sector. You may be feeling unsure as to your feelings or those of another person, not knowing whether the relationship is on solid ground or not. This vibe could also be present in a business alliance. Truth be told, this uncertainty will last into early next week. But Tuesday gives you the chance to gain some clarity and set plans in motion.

"
7077,12 august 2017,gemini,"Yes! The two love planets, Venus and Neptune, from the best angle possible–a trine–and they are both is sectors that govern long term security. Hmmm, are those wedding bells I’m hearing? Proposals, the decision to move in together, developing greater stability in a union, meeting a keeper–all of these are possible in the days to come.

"
7078,12 august 2016,gemini,"This could be a day when passion tries to override common sense, so stay on your toes! The reason? The emotional Moon swings past both rambunctious Mars and serious Saturn in your commitment sector, creating a push-pull when it comes to romance. Should I or shouldn’t I? With foggy Neptune in the mix, the possibility of making the wrong decision is there. Take your time.

"
7079,13 august 2017,gemini,"The next 48 hours are excellent for communication, especially if you need to hammer out a long term arrangement or contract (which includes marriage, by the way!). Your best bet is to be as open as possible with others. With the Moon is your house of confidentiality you shouldn’t spill that which needs to be kept quiet, but honesty and frankness are still required.

"
7080,13 august 2016,gemini,"What are your values in love? That has been the question the cosmos has been asking over the past few weeks and months, and there could have been some friction. This was due to Saturn’s five-month retrograde spin through the heavens, which may have provoked some deep thinking on your part. The good news is that the ringed planet goes direct, so it’s time to get off the fence and make a decision.

"
7081,14 august 2017,gemini,"Hmmmm….does someone have a secret crush? Sure looks that way from your chart. Whether you are the crusher or the crushee is insignificant! Sparks can fly today (below the radar). Make sure that the other person is available and that you are too.

"
7082,14 august 2016,gemini,"A bit of a tempest is brewing as the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, oppose each other in the heavens. You could be at the receiving end of some confusing messages from a loved one, or perhaps it’s you who feels unsure. You want to trust your feelings, but today’s not the best time to do so. Clarity returns on Wednesday.

"
7083,15 august 2017,gemini,"Playing hard to get in love (or even business!) could backfire, so be wary of creating drama when there’s no need for it. However, if someone is trying to gain the upper hand with you, you’ll need to put them on notice that that isn’t going to fly.

"
7084,15 august 2016,gemini,"A family or housing matter needs to be addressed as the Moon reaches out to Mercury in your domestic sector. Pluto is in on the action too, which means that whatever the issue is, it’s gonna be done.  Pluto doesn’t tolerate situations that drag on and on. It will pinpoint exactly what the problem is, but leaves it up to you to resolve it. Fortunately, Mercury will provide you with the smarts and eloquence to handle it.

"
7085,16 august 2017,gemini,"With the Moon in your sign, your confidence level will rise, and you won’t be afraid to say what’s on your mind. People around you may not be ready for your newfound assurance, though, so don’t expect them to be overjoyed that you’re standing your ground!

"
7086,16 august 2016,gemini,"With a full moon arriving later this week in the most adventurous part of your chart, chances are you’re pining for some excitement. And what could be better than a caper with your friends? Yup, an energetic trine today between the chatty Sun and spontaneous Uranus could find you and the tribe planning some kind of audacious getaway or a rager of a party. Move over, Thelma and Louise.

"
7087,17 august 2017,gemini,"Playing footloose and fancy-free has its upside; so does playing it safe. Today’s cosmic energy produces a quandary in which you won’t know which route to take. Whatever you do, keep drama to a minimum. When the solar eclipse In Leo arrives next Monday you’ll be able to figure out what to do next.

"
7088,17 august 2016,gemini,"Open book. That’s what you need to be with a lover, or yourself for that matter, when it comes to matters of the heart. A helpful, cathartic angle between Venus and Pluto enables you to get in touch with your deepest emotions, needs and values. The bottom line: you can make progress with your amour, or come to some important personal decisions about what love should be like.

"
7089,18 august 2017,gemini,"If you’re not in a line of work that makes your heart sing, then today’s positive cosmic energy could help set you in a more rewarding direction. And if you’re happy with your occupation, it’s a smart time to consider ways of bolstering your income. Profits planet Venus has your back!

"
7090,18 august 2016,gemini,"An interesting mix of planetary aspects is at play! Today’s full moon falls in your house of adventure, taking a risk. But Jupiter in your house of comfort and security opposes Chiron, suggesting that a little voice inside your head will be saying, “Slow down! Think things over first.” And while it’s always smart to look before you leap, you can’t make progress if you keep doing things the same way you’ve always done them.

"
7091,19 august 2017,gemini,"It may come as a surprise that someone close doesn’t share the same values or long term plans as you. This could be a pal, a team at the office, a lover or family member, but either way it may throw you off your game a bit. Not to worry. Monday’s eclipse in your communication sector will help you get to the bottom of things.

"
7092,19 august 2016,gemini,"Who’s wearing the pants in your relationships? Whether it’s at work, at home or in a friendship, the planets are telling you to be more assertive. There’s no need to scream and yell. No drama necessary. With the Moon in cahoots with Neptune, a sweet smile and serene composure will disarm everyone.

"
7093,20 august 2016,gemini,"The recent full moon in Aquarius is pushing you out the door and telling you to have some adventures, but a Moon-Venus opposition today may make you feel duty-bound. The office can wait, as well as the cleaning, cooking, laundry, and oh yes, your parents and siblings. If you’re going to do anything around the house, it should be redecorating! Get thee to Bed, Bath and Beyond.

"
7094,21 august 2016,gemini,"Feeling settled in your relationships with others and at home is going to be more important in the weeks ahead. With the Sun moving into your domestic sector on Monday, creating a cozy nest will be on the top of your list. Pretty easy to do if you live alone, but what happens if you have a spouse or lover under the same roof? A powerful Saturn-Mars conjunction this week will shine its light on the state of your union. How happy you are in love will definitely affect how happy you are at home.

"
7095,22 august 2016,gemini,"Over the next four weeks you may find that you’re retreating a bit from the world now that the Sun is in Virgo. It’s a good time to declutter your home, redecorate or look for a new place to live. Your relationships with the people closest to you will be front and center this week, as Mars and Saturn are asking you to examine how secure and comfortable you feel around them. And if anyone is creating turbulence on the home front, chances are that you’re going to put a stop to it.

"
7096,23 august 2016,gemini,"Slow down and pay attention to your intuition! The Moon in the most metaphysical part of your chart is stoking your personal psychic ability. In particular, you should be considering close relationships such as business alliances and romantic entanglements. The issue is that energetic Mars is getting you fired up to take action in a relationship, yet Saturn urges you to contemplate things slowly. Let your sixth sense be your guide.

"
7097,24 august 2016,gemini,"Serious relationships may require a time out, whether they’re romantic or business related. A stern conversation between sober Saturn and red-hot Mars raises questions about how quickly you should be moving forward in your partnership. Mars can’t move ahead fast enough but Saturn is demanding that you know what you’re getting into. Already committed? Then it’s time to recalibrate your roles and expectations of each other.

"
7098,25 august 2016,gemini,"What is it that you  want? An opposition between the Moon, Mars and Saturn may fire up a rebellious streak inside you. It’s not that you’re unwilling to go along with someone else’s plan in love or business, but your needs and concerns need to be addressed. Don’t move forward with plans until you speak your piece. There could be pushback from the other party on Friday, but your contentment and security are of paramount importance.

"
7099,26 august 2016,gemini,"Dial it back at the office and don’t push anyone into doing anything right now. A tense Mars-Neptune square could fire you up to demand results or answers, but other people around you aren’t ready to do so. They may need more time, they could be playing games, but either way, it will backfire if you get in their faces. The same holds true for romantic partnerships today as well. And is you are at the receiving end of a hard sell, give it the 24-hour rule–or 48.

"
7100,27 august 2017,gemini,"Temper, temper! Aggressive Mars has been retrograde in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, stirring up problems and feelings from the past. The good news is that it goes direct today. The not-so-good news is that you could still be all fired up. Watch your words, especially over the next 48 hours.

"
7101,27 august 2016,gemini,"An amazing event happens today in the heavens: cathartic Jupiter meets up with magnetic Venus in an angle so tight that this won’t happen again for another 50 years. In your case Gemini, this occurs in your fourth house of emotions and feelings. This is a wonderful opportunity to release old feelings of not being worthy enough and start to feel comfortable in your skin again. Family matters are also well-aspected, whether it’s finding a new place to live or smoothing ruffled feathers.

"
7102,28 august 2016,gemini,"Why do they have all the fun? That may be what you’re thinking today with a Moon-Uranus square. Friends and colleagues may seem like they’re living La Voda Loca while you’re stuck in Dullsville. The risk is that you may decide to indulge in some emotional spending, which isn’t going to change a thing. With lively Venus just about ready to enter Libra, your fifth house of fun and flirtation, the mood will lighten up soon.

"
7103,29 august 2016,gemini,"Enjoying life will be high on your list over the next three weeks as Venus glides into your fifth house of fun and romance today. However, Mercury retrogrades also in your house of family matters, so if you need to spend quality time with the kids, pencil them in. Whether you’re single or attached, you may need to put certain family members on notice that your private life is just that–private.

"
7104,30 august 2016,gemini,"Mercury goes retrograde today in the sector that deals with your family and home, and as retrogrades go this is a good one. Over the next few weeks you can iron out problems with parents, kids, siblings, landlords and roommates. With lovely Venus now in your romance area, it’s possible that living together is in the cards. Want to have a baby? That’s possible too under the current planetary influences.

"
7105,31 august 2016,gemini,"Spontaneous Uranus is pushing you to express your emotions and get things out in the open. This is especially true of family and home-related matters with Mercury now retrograde in this part of your chart. But now that Venus is in your romance area, should you ask that hottie out on a date? Flirt outrageously? Post provocatively on social media? (Without being trashy, of course.) Hmmmm. The choice is yours.

"
7106,1 september 2016,gemini,"Sometimes there’s nothing better than nesting at home, and today’s solar eclipse will encourage you to create a peaceful and serene home environment. But that might take more than a fresh coat of paint and a new duvet cover. It looks like some boundaries need to be set at your chateau, starting with not taking the stress of your workday home with you. And a lover may need to tone down their attitude and be a bit more cooperative.

"
7107,2 september 2016,gemini,"It’s one thing to be helpful to someone and another to be an enabler or to get walked on. A T-square in the heavens could bring frustration in your relationships as you feel that you’re not keeping everyone happy. For heaven’s sakes, Gemini, lighten up! Planetary aspects indicate that you’re spreading yourself too thin as you aim to please. Take some time for yourself today.

"
7108,3 september 2016,gemini,"It’s the perfect weekend to spend time with the family unit as La Luna touches off happy angles with Jupiter and Venus. If you have an elderly relative in assisted living or they’ve been home with too much time on their hands, it would mean a lot if you planned to visit them. Planets in your emotional sector of nostalgia and family ties recommend sharing memories of the past and preserving them for future generations.

"
7109,4 september 2016,gemini,"With Pluto retrograding through one of the most sensitive parts of your chart, old emotions, fears and grudges are no doubt bubbling to the surface of your conscious mind. This is necessary, however. Release the baggage and move on. But today could be a bit tense as the Moon in your house of romance squares Pluto, reminding you of past disappointments and current dramas. This Wednesday is a fabulous day for getting things off your chest with a lover so that you can enter a happier, more contented phase.

"
7110,5 september 2016,gemini,"Sometimes we need to create balance when it comes to whom we spend our time with, as what we actually do when we’re chilling out. A group of angles today suggests that you relax at home with your family (or maybe just by yourself with a good book and a bottle of wine!). As much as you may love your pals, take a breather from them, at least momentarily. When Jupiter enters Libra later this week you’ll be ready to get into the social crush again.

"
7111,6 september 2016,gemini,"The next few days are super for creating domestic bliss as a number of celestial orbs are smiling at each other in the heavens. You’re in a perfect spot to find the right house, condo or apartment to live in, not to mention the best neighborhood. Smooth out family dramas to the best of your ability, which may require getting your emotions out there on the table. Wednesday is a good time to talk things over with family members or a lover, as a helpful Venus-Saturn sextile wants to bring stability at home.

"
7112,7 september 2016,gemini,"Ready to settle down with a keeper? If that’s the case, romantic Venus and long-term Saturn have your back! The same holds true for smoothing out troubles in an existing relationship, conceiving a baby, and finding someone new. A wildly romantic year lies ahead as Jupiter is getting ready to soar into your fifth house of amour. Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.

"
7113,8 september 2016,gemini,"It’s a sweet day for romance as the passionate Moon connects with lusty Mars and long-term Saturn.  With Jupiter entering the most enjoyable part of your chart tomorrow for the first time in 13 years, even the most settled relationships should see a surge in amorous moments. Just one caveat: don’t let your work life take over your free time. Life’s too short for your job to consume you.

"
7114,9 september 2016,gemini,"Renaissance. The word literally means “rebirth”, and it holds special meaning, especially for you over the next 13 months. Abundant Jupiter has just entered your fifth house of creative mojo, enjoying culture, and appreciating the finer aspects of life. This is also the house where we find new love and bring new life onto the planet, so if you’ve been anxious to conceive, this is your year. It’s all about letting your hair down and having some fun, so enjoy this gift from the cosmos!

"
7115,10 september 2016,gemini,"Lucky Jupiter entered your house of romance yesterday for the first time in over a decade, but don’t start planning your wedding or naming babies just yet. Couples need to be wary too, as a tough Neptune-Saturn square may serve you with a reality check. All Geminis run the risk of wearing rose-colored glasses when it comes to their mate and planning the future. Take off the shades and get real.

"
7116,11 september 2016,gemini,"Expressing your deepest emotions could be a bit of a dilemma today as passionate Venus squares tough-guy Pluto. You may feel like there’s so  much bubbling up inside of you that you’d like to communicate, but that you’re tripping over your tongue. It’s possible that an individual in your orbit is pulling rank or trying to take control of a situation, exacerbating matters. But a lunar eclipse this Friday in your house of authority will put you in the driver’s seat.

"
7117,12 september 2016,gemini,"If a certain relationship has become more trouble than it’s worth, you may be considering moving on. Drama, power struggles, anger–who needs it? Life’s too short. And now that fun-loving Jupiter is in your frisky fifth house of romance, culture and entertainment, you’ll only want to spend time with people who make your heart sing.

"
7118,13 september 2016,gemini,"As the lunar eclipse this Friday draws near, you may be considering making some big changes in your career. But murky Neptune may be clouding your vision, making you vulnerable to the opinions of others. In addition, with the Sun in your house of comfort, you may be reluctant to shake up your routine. But eclipses pack a punch and provide us with the impetus to get past inertia!

"
7119,14 september 2016,gemini,"Friday’s eclipse is designed to put you in the seat of authority, focusing on your goals, but today’s planetary activity suggests that you consider teaming up with others. No man or woman is an island, and the company you keep in the year ahead could prove to be key when it comes to the realization of your dreams.

"
7120,15 september 2016,gemini,"People may be talking about you behind your back, but this is a good thing! It seems that a friend, mentor, client or boss may have put in a good word for you. Your talents and expertise are being discussed, and with tomorrow’s eclipse in your career sector, their compliments could pay off in the weeks and months ahead.

"
7121,16 september 2016,gemini,"Get ready for your closeup! A sizzling lunar eclipse in your fame and success sector can open up doors over the next six months that may have been firmly shut in the past. Lunar events like this tend to close things out, so it’s possible that a boss or key client goes buh-bye. The could also be tension in business alliances due to a tense Mars angle. But overall this is a positive lunation, so set things in motion that will get your reputation and skills noticed by decision makers.

"
7122,17 september 2016,gemini,"It’s a super day to make new contacts, and an inspirational time with people you already know. Lovers can start making plans for the future. Someone could offer you the chance to join a team or association that will propel your career forward. Singles could meet a new hottie via an introduction from a friend or by searching online. Hanging out at a hobby show could help you meet people who share your passion. Get out there and mingle!

"
7123,18 september 2016,gemini,"You’re not in the mood for any surprises in love, unless of course it means meeting someone new when you weren’t expecting to, or getting a ring slipped on your finger! Today lovely Venus forms a sweet angle with Mars in your commitment sector, so get ready for some happy moments ahead.

"
7124,19 september 2016,gemini,"Terrific day ahead for lovers as Venus in your house of romance winks at lusty Mars in the commitment sector! With the Moon in secluded Taurus you may be feeling the need for even more intimacy. Singles,  you’re not excluded. Someone at the office or in your industry may be harboring a secret crush on you.  But should you go down that path?

"
7125,20 september 2016,gemini,"Your deepest emotions and thoughts can get an “upgrade” this week as not one, but two positive trines occur between intelligent Mercury and metamorphic Pluto. The first one takes place today, and with Mercury retrograde, it will help you reflect on past dramas and feelings of jealousy, resentment, or anger (we all have them!). By Friday Mercury will be direct, so while today is perfect for self-assessment, Friday is better for talking about your thoughts.

"
7126,22 september 2016,gemini,"If you’ve been looking for love in all the wrong places, those days are over. The Sun has just joined Jupiter in your fifth house of romance, making the next four weeks the best time in over a decade (you read that right) to find love, conceive a baby, or reach a higher level of commitment in an existing romance. The 26th is the best day of them all!

"
7127,23 september 2016,gemini,"The emotional Moon in Cancer may push you to demand answers from a lover, which may not be the best move under current planetary influences. Let sleeping dogs lie, at least for the next few days. Likewise, remain patient about finding new love. Monday is an incredible day for all Geminis to make progress in romance.

"
7128,24 september 2016,gemini,"Don’t be strong-armed, or even mildly influenced, to spend money on something if you’re not sure of its worth—or your ability to pay down the debt associated with it. The emotional Moon in your money house could encourage you to spend, but hold off for now.

"
7129,25 september 2016,gemini,"With sultry Venus now in your house of physique and fitness, looking and feeling your best will become a focus over the next three weeks. It looks like some readjustment is necessary though in order to make this work. Venus forms an aspect with Neptune in your ambition sector that indicates the need to either switch up your workout schedule or to reconsider your “deadlines”. Shredding for the wedding (or the high school reunion) could be a bit too much right now.

"
7130,26 september 2016,gemini,"Romance is the main course on your menu over the next few months as a series of yummy planetary aspects helps you not only enjoy the company of another person, but to enjoy life in general. A happy meeting today between the Sun and optimistic Jupiter in your house of amour and creativity will enable you to find new love, conceive a baby, or get more serious about the person you’re involved with. Saturday brings a new moon in the same part of the sky, opening a six-month window of opportunity.

"
7131,27 september 2016,gemini,"Keep a close eye on your spending over the next 7 weeks as Mars has just entered your eighth house of financial stability. The red planet’s presence in this sector can do two things: make you want to spend like crazy, or inspire you to budget, save and invest. The choice is yours. Powerful Pluto just ended a five-month retrograde in this house, pointing out weaknesses in your financial portfolio and your personal habits. Hopefully you’ve gained some insight and will now apply it!

"
7132,28 september 2016,gemini,"Trying to close a major client, land a new job or negotiate a raise? If so, take what you hear with a grain of salt. Someone in a position of authority might be blowing smoke up your hoo-ha as deceptive Neptune is in a tough angle. Even  if you’re not in the midst of negotiations, the boss or some kind of authority figure could be full of BS today. Smile, then go off and regroup.

"
7133,29 september 2016,gemini,"A friend or acquaintance could reach out or react in an unexpected manner, Gemini. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing though, as whatever transpires can help you build a better relationship. Your emotions may go all over the place as the Moon is one of the most sensitive parts of your chart. Keep calm, listen, then adjust as necessary.

"
7134,30 september 2016,gemini,"We’ve all heard the term “getting lucky”, but your sign can benefit the most today when it comes to romance! A fortuitous meeting of the passionate Moon and abundant Jupiter could bring in a new love, pregnancy, engagement or renewal of your vows. It’s also the perfect aspect for planning a fun night out, especially at a cultural event. Enjoy!

"
7135,1 october 2016,gemini,"Gemini, you’re in luck as today’s new moon falls in your house of romance, fun and creativity! Over the next few months you should be carving out quality time for your lover, kids and yes, yourself. Sign up for cooking classes, hit some art galleries, plan a quick vacay and take the kids to a museum. Singles, this is one of your best times all year to meet someone new. A happy Venus-Neptune trine suggests that the best place to meet a hottie is at the gym, the office or your industry.

"
7136,2 october 2016,gemini,"Yesterday’s new moon in Libra ushered in a period in which you’ll want to be out there mingling with others, for all sorts of reasons–joining forces with likeminded people to support a good cause, searching for love or making more industry contacts. Some of these people will remain in your orbit for years to come, so keep an open mind and look for folks who will only add to your experiences.

Don’t worry, the work will still be piled up on your desk on Monday morning. But at least you had the opportunity to blow off some steam and treat yourself to some indulgence.

"
7138,4 october 2016,gemini,"Your ability to lay out a workable plan for the future increases today as the benevolent Sun points out some of the best directions to head in. From your chart it appears that you want to live a more fun-filled, enjoyable life as you take care of the daily grind. Living more creatively is on the table right now, as is finding the right person to share your time with. the initiatives you take will have long term ramifications, so choose wisely.

"
7139,5 october 2016,gemini,"Try to wrap up discussions at work or home about the division of labor, budgeting and deadlines. A productive Venus-Pluto trine will help you take an authoritative stance without coming off like a bully. Also, make sure that you  are on target with individual goals and chores. Later in the week some difficult angles threaten to derail plans and projects; now is the time to get organized.

"
7140,6 october 2016,gemini,"Friction may arise in a close relationship as the two most energetic planets, Mars and Jupiter, are at loggerheads today. You may be prone to overanalyzing as you try to predict a future outcome. Or you might let negative emotions, such as mistrust, jealousy or impatience get in your way. Don’t push things or overreact, because this energy will be bubbling up through the 15th of the month.

"
7141,7 october 2016,gemini,"Sharing is caring! Or is it? With verbose Mercury entering your house of romance and children today, you may be tempted over the next few weeks to have some serious conversations with your loved ones. Which is fine….except that the Sun, already in this part of the sky, and Mercury will be in tight angles to others in the next two weeks. Battles over who’s in charge may erupt, along with moodiness, egotistical dramas and maybe even resentment. Use your words to heal, not to wound.

"
7142,8 october 2016,gemini,"Confidence is sexy, and you should have it in spades this weekend as La Luna swings past the two most charismatic planets in the solar system, Mars and Pluto. Romantic Neptune in your success sector forms a sweet angle to all three, so to say that you might “get lucky” is an understatement! Boudoir escapades aside, this is also a smart time to consider your biggest dreams and how to execute them.

"
7143,9 october 2016,gemini,"This is a good day to get in touch with your deepest thoughts and feelings, whether you decide to share them or keep them to yourself. The emotional Moon moves past transformative Pluto and high octane Mars, a positive aspect for identifying thought patterns that don’t serve you and then letting them go.

"
7144,10 october 2016,gemini,"Your creativity and talents get a boost this week as planets in your fifth house of skill form terrific aspects. Today is especially auspicious as the Moon in your blue-skies-ahead sector urges you to polish up your skills even more. Find a mentor, take a class, attend a weekend workshop or seminar or buy a book that will inspire you.

"
7145,11 october 2016,gemini,"Yum! A delicious meet up between Mercury and abundant Jupiter is all about romance: finding it, enhancing it, and basically having more fun in life. Just make sure that you and a lover are on the same page when it comes to finances. Singles, beware of falling for a charming but broke lover. With next week’s full moon in your house of camaraderie, a friend is the best way to meet someone new.

"
7146,12 october 2016,gemini,"Fears and insecurities may get the better of you today as eager Mars stirs things up in your house of emotions. Resist the urge to push others for an answer or a commitment, whether it’s a financial matter or one that involves the heart. This cosmic energy will persist for another week, so patience is going to be needed.

"
7147,13 october 2016,gemini,"It’s essential that you don’t read too much into a situation, a possibility with commanding Mars in your house of emotions. Otherwise jealousy, fear and resentment could bubble up to the surface of your psyche, wreaking havoc. This is especially true in matters of the heart. You could also be running hot and cold, not knowing from day to day how you feel about a particular person. Some of the fog will clear at Sunday’s full moon.

"
7148,14 october 2016,gemini,"If you need to discuss something with a lover, child or business partner today’s the best day to do so. Serious Saturn is in a helpful angle, trying to set things in stone. Such as: marriage plans, custody arrangements for a child, the division of labor in your company, or selling your artwork. Tomorrow ain’t going to be so easy, so carpe diem.

"
7149,15 october 2016,gemini,"Emotions all over the place? Not surprising with four planets all at odds today! In your case, Gemini, they are active in the sectors of love, family and friends. Someone close may act erratically, throwing you off balance. It’s also possible that a power struggle erupts as someone (you maybe?) uses guilt, fear or jealousy to manipulate a situation to their liking. Tomorrow’s full moon will bring this to a head, so get ready to make some serious decisions.

"
7150,16 october 2016,gemini,"A full moon/supermoon in your eleventh house of friends and networking could bring something to a close, such as a project you’ve been working on, like bachelorette party plans or a team work assignment. This is the house that governs technology, so anything digital could reach a climax: launching a new website, putting the finishing touches on an app you’re coding or successfully wrapping up a social media campaign. But full moons will shine their light also on what’s not working, such as a friend, team member or software program that just isn’t cutting it any longer. If that’s the case, resolve to make necessary changes.

"
7151,17 october 2016,gemini,"Our thoughts create our emotions and our actions. Everything we do begins with a thought. And today a helpful aspect takes place between the cleansing Moon and transformative Pluto in the parts of your chart that deal with your innermost thoughts. If yours are holding you back, especially when it comes to matters of the heart, it’s time to let them go.

"
7152,18 october 2016,gemini,"Finders, keepers! If you’re looking for a new love these days you could find a keeper as romantic Venus enters your seventh house of commitment for the next three weeks. Existing relationships could experience an amorous resurgence. As a result, all Geminis need to clear some time on their schedules for love!

"
7153,19 october 2016,gemini,"One heck of a day lies ahead, Gemini! A megawatt meeting between Pluto and Mars in your sexy eighth house could stir up passionate emotions. Whether you’re single or attached the desire to bond with someone could be sky high. With this kind of energy, you won’t be interested in wimps or bores but the strong, lusty type. Not only that, your finances could get a lift as a power broker or decision maker provides you with assistance. This could be a mortgage broker, judge, angel investor or potential business partner. Make sure that you network over the next few days.

"
7154,20 october 2016,gemini,"Who’s on your side? This may have been on your mind over the past week, as the recent full moon may have found you questioning the motives of people in your innermost circle. Today the questions linger on with a Mercury-Uranus opposition. It could simply be that there are too many people around you providing different opinions and advice, and it’s hard to figure out which direction to go in. Take a deep breath and relax. When the Sun enters Scorpio on Saturday clarity will return.

"
7155,21 october 2016,gemini,"Keep a cool head about you today when it comes to financial matters. A tense Moon-Pluto-Mars opposition could find you stewing about money: how much you’re saving vs. spending, the return you’re receiving on a particular investment, or which way to go in a career matter. With the mighty Sun entering your efficiency sector this weekend, you’re in a perfect spot for figuring out answers to these questions.

"
7156,22 october 2016,gemini,"Time to get your act together. Now that the Sun is in Scorpio, you need to address the piles of papers on your desk, unfinished projects, and inefficient ways of getting things done. Over the next four weeks you should take a look at your habits and routines when it comes to your home and work life. If this means hiring help, obtaining better technology, or switching to more reliable vendors, so be it. The new moon on the 30th is a great time to inaugurate changes.

"
7157,23 october 2016,gemini,"Who’s wearing the pants in your relationship? That’s a question for both romantic liaisons and business ones. The earlier part of this week could see a struggle erupt between you and another person who may be trying to gain control of a situation. However, their tactics may be passive-aggressive rather than direct. Today’s a good time to analyze the situation and make efforts to find an equal balance.

"
7158,24 october 2016,gemini,"Werk it! Now that intelligent Mercury is in your house of efficiency, you should be able to dazzle others with your can-do attitude and your ability to plow through assignments with ease and accuracy. A new moon will take place in this part of the sky soon, so both of these orbs can help you line up a new job, better clients or projects, and perhaps even juicier benefits. This Thursday is perfect for showcasing your talents.

"
7159,25 october 2016,gemini,"Someone may try to pull rank with you, and it may be someone close such as a lover or business partner. A difficult Venus-Neptune square may find you questioning who’s in charge of an alliance. If it’s a supervisor at work, obviously they’re the boss, but they could resort to criticism, passive-aggressive behavior or just plain old bulls***. This should pass quickly and on Wednesday you’ll have the opportunity to get centered again.

"
7160,26 october 2016,gemini,"Sweet! A happy angle between love planet Venus in your commitment sector and optimistic Jupiter in your romance zone bodes well for romance. New love could be on the horizon, an existing relationship could get a lot more serious, conception could occur and attached Geminis could experience an amorous renewal. With serious Saturn in the long-term sector, decisions you make now could last a lifetime.

"
7161,27 october 2016,gemini,"Don’t hide your light under a bushel! Speak up at the office, as a powerful Sun-Mercury conjunction will allow you to shine. Dazzle bosses and clients with a presentation of your ideas. Prospect for new business. Brainstorm with your colleagues. Propose new protocols or routines that will help make things move more efficiently. At the very least, streamline your own work flow by wrapping up unfinished business, returning calls and e-mails and clearing off your desk.

"
7162,28 october 2016,gemini,"Lucky Jupiter has been gracing your house of romance since September, its first visit here in over 12 years. And today the passionate Moon forms a super aspect with Jupiter, allowing you to get in touch with your emotions concerning someone else. Got a crush on someone? Let them know! Attached Geminis should plan a sexy date night out. This is also a terrific opportunity to spend quality time with kids, possibly even taking them to work with you so they could learn more about your life.

"
7163,29 october 2016,gemini,"Defining moment! Love planet Venus meets up with long-term Saturn in your commitment sector. Should you stay in a relationship or move on? Many Geminis could decide to tie the knot under this aspect, while singles could meet a serious contender for their heart. But there is some static coming from the sidelines, as a friend or acquaintance may act out—possibly out of jealousy. With lusty Mars in your house of libido, your sex life (or lack of one) could become an issue in romance. Talk things over.

"
7164,30 october 2016,gemini,"Ready to pull ahead of the pack? A terrific new moon takes place in your sixth house of work and efficiency. Typically, when a new moon occurs here you can impress the boss and clients but not necessarily land a new job. But this one is a game changer as Mercury trines Neptune in your career zone the same day. You could become inspired to seek out a big promotion, a new gig or even start your own company. If you’re happy where you are, this lunation is perfect for streamlining your workday and reducing stress.

"
7165,31 october 2016,gemini,"Yesterday’s new moon is stirring up your desire to get things done which is always a good thing. But you need to stay focused and not let the people around you throw you off task, a possibility under current planetary aspects. Your newfound can-do attitude may invoke envy in others who may be determined to slow down your progress. Charge ahead!

"
7166,1 november 2016,gemini,"Step into a more authoritative role. A glorious Sun-Neptune trine helps to dispel any misconceptions as to who’s the boss. Whether it’s at home, at work or a group endeavor (such as the PTO or a charity) you need to let others know that you can, and will, get the job done. The recent new moon is turning you into a force of nature; slackers beware!

"
7167,2 november 2016,gemini,"With the Sun in your house of productivity you may be so focused on getting things done that you can’t see the big picture. While it’s commendable to scratch items of your to-do list, you also need a little romance and adventure. Luckily the planets have that in mind for you. When lusty Mars enters your house of risk taking on the 9th (its first trip here in two years) you’ll start spreading your wings and taking flight—away from the grunt work!

"
7168,3 november 2016,gemini,"You’re in a terrific place for developing new habits and protocols that will have a positive long term effect on your life. Sometimes just establishing a daily ritual or routine is all it takes to solidify actions that will help you, such as staying on a diet or keeping clutter reduced. The planets suggest that you also examine your emotions and past feelings to determine why previous attempts to get things done didn’t work out. Do that and you can move forward.

"
7169,4 november 2016,gemini,"Sick of being a doormat, enabler or being taken for granted? Maybe you’re fed up too with someone’s jealousy or over-the-top emotions. If that’s the case, you may feel it keenly today as the Moon swings past Pluto. There’s no point in getting emotional about it, but there is  a point in deciding to end it. Pluto is the planet of power—seize your own by mastering your own emotions first.

"
7170,5 november 2016,gemini,"Don’t feel guilty about enjoying life and all of the good things it offers. You deserve love, health and success (whatever success means to you), and this should become apparent with today’s happy Venus-Uranus trine. It’s also a sweet day for romance: singles could meet a keeper, couples can go the distance. Whatever you do, don’t stay home alone. It’s a highly social weekend and this is just one of the ways to live the good life—in the company of friends.

"
7171,6 november 2016,gemini,"Life can’t be all about work. Giving back–to your community, church, the less fortunate or helping protect the environment–can make you feel a lot more in tune with our fabulous planet. Today free-spirited Uranus encourages you to take part in something bigger than yourself. You may end up being amazed at the change in perspective you develop.

"
7172,7 november 2016,gemini,"With the Sun in your structured sixth house of duty, routine and getting through the grunt work, you may wonder if there will be some play time in the near future. Well, say “Hallelujah, amen!” because effervescent Mars is just about ready to enter your free-wheeling house of adventure on Wednesday. Start planning capers and mayhem right now.

"
7173,8 november 2016,gemini,"If you want a project to go to the next level, you may need the assistance of others. You should be filled with a lot of ambition and bright ideas, courtesy of the Moon in your expansive ninth house, but the cosmos suggests that two (or more) heads are better than one right now. Team efforts hold a lot of promise for you, even if that means sucking it up and dealing with slackers and malcontents. Don’t worry—by mid-December you’ll be able to go it alone.

"
7174,9 november 2016,gemini,"Emotional breakthroughs are a big, happy possibility for you over the next three weeks! First, energetic Mars moves into your house of optimism and blue-skies thinking today. Then on Friday lovely Venus glides into the sector that governs your deepest feelings, especially some of the stinky ones like regret, jealousy, resentment and anger. These two orbs will help you get to the bottom of things that have been bothering you, maybe for years, so that you can release them and move on. Kudos!

"
7175,10 november 2016,gemini,"You could become quite emotional today about an ambition that’s important to you, but that’s a good thing—it’s called “passion”.  As the Moon glides past Neptune inspiration can strike. Pay attention to the ideas, gut hunches and dreams that you have in the days ahead, as they will provide you with insight. The key is to take your passion projects and create logical, step-by-step plans to achieve them, easy to do with the Sun in your efficiency zone.

"
7176,11 november 2016,gemini,"Ggrrrr, tiger! Sexy Venus just glided into your house of libido for a steamy three-week stay. With Monday’s full moon pending in your house of secrecy and fantasies, this is a good weekend to get a room, if you catch my drift. Singles, Saturn is in your commitment house, urging you to find the Real Deal. Just be wary in the weeks ahead of lusty, charismatic characters who show a lot of promise in the boudoir but not elsewhere.

"
7177,12 november 2016,gemini,"It’s time to open up the lines of communication with the people closest to you, especially romantic and business partners. Candid Mercury just entered your relating sector, so get things off your chest. With the upcoming full moon on Monday, you may have a lot on your mind that needs to get out. Now’s the time. If they can’t handle it…so be it.

"
7178,13 november 2016,gemini,"Put a fork in it–it’s done.  And you may be totally done with whacked out co-workers, demanding family members, your ever-expanding waist line and the sense that there’s more to life than this. Blame it on the super moon that arrives tomorrow in your house of closure. This can be a powerfully beneficial full moon, but only if you resolve to make changes.

"
7179,14 november 2016,gemini,"Going viral is a darn good possibility for you, Cancer, as a super moon in your house of technology today helps you lock down a winner! Any tech project for that matter can shine under these auspices, such as updating a website, starting a blog, coding an app or even finding a lover online. But this lunation isn’t just about pounding the keyboard on your computer; it’s also perfect for socializing with friends, getting involved in volunteer organizations and joining forces with others for a terrific collaboration.

"
7180,15 november 2016,gemini,"Keep your emotions in check, especially when dealing with people in positions of authority. A power broker/boss could be difficult to decipher, handing you a ration of BS over something you didn’t do, or they’re vacillating from one position to another. The good news is that with Mars in your expansive, big-picture-thinking ninth house, you will be able to easily see the broader view. Of course, the fact that you can see things that the boss can’t could be a part of their problem!

"
7181,16 november 2016,gemini,"Is your life in balance? Do you get to your chores at home in a prompt and efficient manner—or are you drowning in a sea of unfinished and urgent things to do? The same holds true for your office routines and workload. If you’re not on top of things, then today is a good time to examine your habits and systems for weaknesses. Take a good look too at any group activities that may be mired in red tape, procrastination or chaos. You can only be responsible for your own actions, but you can still point out to others that there’s a better way of getting things done.

"
7182,17 november 2016,gemini,"The next few days could be uncomfortable as murky Neptune is creating waves in your house of authority. On the one hand, you may feel as though you’re being manipulated by people and things that are bigger than you, which undermines your sense of security. On the other, it may be you who is trying to push people and circumstances around in order to get your way. The recent full moon may have drummed up feelings of low self-worth; don’t let them cloud your judgment.

"
7183,18 november 2016,gemini,"Got a business deal you’re trying to close? Or maybe you need an answer from a lover—now—because you’re anxious to move the relationship to the next level. All I can say is, “Good luck!” Don’t count on a firm answer today, or for that matter, an honest one. Neptune, planet of obfuscation, is stirring the pot. You’re better off waiting for the Sun to move into Sagittarius on Monday, which will put you in more of a powerful situation. Make sure that the people you’re dealing with truly support you.

"
7184,19 november 2016,gemini,"Get ready to take ownership of your ambitions as confusing Neptune finally goes direct after a five month hiatus. Since June or July you may have been unable to decide on a particular path to take, or found that others were indecisive and not willing to commit. That’s about to change fast! With the Sun entering your partnership sector on Monday, you could see forward motion with romantic relationships or business alliances. Just remember: you’re in the driver’s seat now.

"
7185,20 november 2016,gemini,"It’s a perfect day to pick up the phone, call a friend and head off on a spontaneous little adventure. Rebellious Uranus wants you to spend less time working around the house and the office and more quality time for yourself. Besides, you never know whom you might meet while you’re out cavorting! A pal could be an important source of an introduction in the week ahead.

"
7186,21 november 2016,gemini,"Intimacy and romance are two separate things. After all, what’s the point in having a lover if you can’t connect with them on a deeply emotional, even spiritual level? Dinners out and good sex can only go so far. This week will bring this point home as you will have to examine how soulful a relationship you truly have. Fear not, however–the Sun enters your commitment sector today, an auspicious aspect for long term bonding.

"
7187,22 november 2016,gemini,"Now that the Sun is in your partnership sector, relating to others should become a lot easier. You may need to use more creative ways to get through to the people in your circle, be they family members or people at the office. But a happy angle today will help you do just that. Sometimes just planning a fun luncheon or evening out, away from the stress of home base, is enough to get people to lighten up.

"
7188,23 november 2016,gemini,"Are you ready to go the distance? In romance, that is! A megawatt meeting between Mercury and Saturn presses you to have The Talk with a lover. You know, the one that starts off with, “Where is this relationship going?” It’s time to get off the fence, as Saturn is the planet of long-term planning. If either you or your lover are holding back—expressing love, getting engaged, planning a family—next week’s new moon is going to shine its light on the issue. Single? You could meet a keeper in the days ahead.

"
7189,24 november 2016,gemini,"Mixed signals could arise between you and a romantic partner, and the problem seems to be a lack of communication. Pluto and Mercury are both in your house of intimacy, encouraging you to pour your heart out—and maybe you’re doing just that without enough feedback from the other person. It’s critical right now to not just get carried away with a romance, but to know deep down that this person is right for you. The only way you’ll know is by studying their actions and paying attention to their words.

"
7190,25 november 2016,gemini,"Love relationships can take a dramatic turn for the better as Venus and Pluto encourage you to share your thoughts and emotions with your amour. Singles, now’s the time to be on the lookout for a soulmate, someone who will truly understand you. The new moon on the 29th is custom made for all Geminis to open up a new chapter in romance. Listen to your own heart and not the advice of others when you make your pick.

"
7191,26 november 2016,gemini,"If there’s one message the cosmos wants you to get these days, Gemini, it’s that partnering with others is your ticket to living a better life. Your chart is loaded with planets in the houses that govern business alliances, volunteer groups, friendship, industry connections and romance. To shut yourself off from the world would be a crime, especially with today’s terrific Mercury-Uranus trine encouraging you to get out and mingle.

"
7192,27 november 2016,gemini,"Friends with benefits? Don’t be surprised if a “pal” shows more interest in you than usual. Likewise, a friend may want to set you up with someone, or express their opinion about your love life. Don’t go there. Planetary influences indicate that you’re better off relying on your own opinion than the opinions of others.

"
7193,28 november 2016,gemini,"Romance reboot! The new moon on Tuesday falls in your house of commitment, which bodes well for attached Geminis who need to put the spark back in their romance. Singles could meet a new beau or belle with long term potential. With lusty Mars in your house of adventure, things could get (ahem) interesting.

"
7194,29 november 2016,gemini,"Two heads are better than one and today’s lunar activity encourages you to join forces with other people for a common goal. Find an exercise buddy, a local mom who’s willing to swap baby sitting duties, or a business partner. Looking for love? Jupiter is in a super angle, helping singles find a keeper and couples to develop an even deeper bond. Just keep an eye on finances, both in love and commerce. Know what you’re getting into if an alliance requires an investment of cash or sharing money. Is your partner solvent, and do they share the same goals?

"
7195,30 november 2016,gemini,"Cooperation may be in short supply as people around you all seem to be focused on their own agenda. Trouble is, with the jovial Sun in your partnership sector, you’re  willing to work with others. If someone else is wearing their bossy pants, let ‘em. This soon shall pass. Just focus on your own needs and activities today.

"
7196,1 december 2016,gemini,"Your optimism about life will soar as energetic Mars and abundant Jupiter hold their once a year meeting. Luckily for you, they’re in your romance and adventure sectors, and they’re determined to bust you out of a rut. This is a mind expanding vibe, so consider taking a class, hanging out with new people from other cultures, exploring different philosophies or going to an off-the-beaten path travel destination.

"
7197,2 december 2016,gemini,"Talk flirty to me! If there was ever a time to get your feelings out in the open with a romantic partner it’s now, Gemini. Transformative Pluto and love planet Venus are in your house of sharing deep emotions, and today they’re joined by verbal Mercury. While this can bring about sexy texting, this is also a time for soulful discussions in which you can make a lot of progress. Make sure to hold meaningful discussions before the 19th as Mercury will retrograde then. And the last thing you need at the holidays is unnecessary drama with your lover.

"
7198,3 december 2016,gemini,"Your creativity is off the charts these days, so don’t dismiss ideas that come your way. Whether you dream up fabulous ideas for decorating your house, the ultimate client presentation, better ways to communicate with your kids or an invention that will make you a millionaire, there’s no limit to what you can achieve. And when Venus enters Aquarius next Wednesday, you’ll be even more inspired.

"
7199,4 december 2016,gemini,"Your attitudes and emotions toward love may improve this week as a number of positive aspects are buoying your optimism. The great thing is that this confidence will spill over to other parts of your life. Once your mind has been expanded and you see things differently, there’s usually no going back to old ways of thinking. Life is too short to spend your days thinking about the small stuff.

"
7200,5 december 2016,gemini,"This is no time to keep bright ideas hidden under a bushel, Gemini. Your ability to come up with solutions to problems or profitable ideas for a business are fabulous under current planetary conditions. But you’re going to need help turning these into reality, so seek out the help of people in the know. Someone whom you may not expect to be in your corner could actually turn out to be an angel is disguise.

"
7201,6 december 2016,gemini,"With energetic Mars in your house of far flung travel, this is a good time to plan a trip that’s more than just downtime—it’s an adventure. And with spontaneous Uranus active in your friendship sector, consider which partners in crime you’d like to bring with you on this adventure. Parents, leave the kids at home and take a voyage with some other burned out adults. You need to recharge your batteries.

"
7202,7 december 2016,gemini,"Busting out of a rut is what the cosmos has planned for you, Gemini! Dynamic Mars has been in the most adventurous part of your chart, and now Venus is joining him today. With next week’s full moon in Gemini spotlighting you—your passions, goals and dreams—it’s time to think about how you can radically switch things up. From your love life to career to travel plans, think outside the box.

"
7203,8 december 2016,gemini,"Filters, please! Before you say it (or text it) think twice about your words. The problem is the assertive Mars is in your highly opinionated ninth house, and even though you may be entitled to your own ideas, others may not agree. Nor will they enjoy seeing how motivated you’ve become. Unless you want to deal with backlash, keep things low key.

"
7204,9 december 2016,gemini,"Planetary influences indicate that you need to get crystal clear about a romantic or business partnership, and today’s a good time to focus. Saturday brings a major meeting between the Sun and Saturn in which you’ll have to make some choices. Consider whether you need to retain the services of a booking agent, attorney or PR agent. Ask yourself if your lover is the right one for you, or if there are issues that need to be settled. Next week’s full moon in your sign is telling you to take care of #1.

"
7205,10 december 2016,gemini,"Significant progress can be made today in partnerships, but the key is to make sure first that you’re both on the same page. If you’ve been kidding yourself about a romantic partner or business alliance, sober Saturn will smack you upside the head. Under current planetary aspects you may find that others are interested in joining forces with you, but you need to be choosy.

"
7206,11 december 2016,gemini,"Holding a heart to heart discussion with someone is a good way to cement your relationship, Gemini. The emotional Moon is in a terrific angle today to help you dig deep and get your emotions and thoughts out there. You may end up being surprised at the way your connection to this person is transformed. It’s important to do this now before the full moon in your sign on Tuesday, as it will close out one chapter so that other can begin.

"
7207,12 december 2016,gemini,"To thine own self be true? The people around you, from family to friends to lovers, may be full of advice and some of it may sound pretty darn good. But the cosmos suggests that you pay attention to that small, still voice of wisdom in your head that always seems to guide you in the right direction. Tomorrow’s full moon in your sign will ask you to balance your own opinions against those of others. Don’t let anyone twist your arm into doing things their way.

"
7208,13 december 2016,gemini,"Woo-hoo! The cosmos delivers a glistening full moon in your sign today, Gemini. It’s time to focus on your goals, dreams and passions and what you’d like to accomplish in 2017. If a relationship has been less than satisfying, you may decide to move on with a Moon-Saturn opposition. It’s critical that you share the same values and wishes for the future. That being said, a luscious Moon-Jupiter aspect bodes well for creating more romantic moments in your union or even finding new love.

"
7209,14 december 2016,gemini,"Considering that yesterday’s full moon fell in your sign, Gemini, your needs and dreams will be foremost in your mind. Not in a selfish way, but a healthy one. You’re ready to move forward with some big plans, but your friends and romantic partner may not be on board. They’re in for a big surprise once Mars enters your house of authority next Monday. Nothing is going to hold you back.

"
7210,15 december 2016,gemini,"Get ready for a s*** storm as four celestial orbs can’t seem to get their act together today. It’s really just a matter of mixed signals coming from the general direction of your lover, kids and friends. This storm will be brief, however, and by Saturday you’ll be in a much better place to figure out what people are thinking. When Mercury retrogrades next week it will be time to think about your  emotions for a change.

"
7211,17 december 2016,gemini,"The energy of the recent full moon in Gemini is still in effect, and it puts your needs and goals in the forefront of your mind. Today is perfect for holding conversations with friends and partners, be they romantic or business. They may be able to provide you with some thought-provoking advice that will be helpful in the months ahead. Keep an open mind and consider all of your options.

"
7212,18 december 2016,gemini,"You may be tempted to hold back and not express your opinions today, as a tense Moon-Mars opposition warns against it. But that doesn’t mean that you’ll be suffering in silence in the weeks ahead. Quite the opposite! You’ll be too busy to care. That’s because aggressive Mars moves into your house of personal ambition tomorrow, firing you up to focus on what’s important to you. Worrying about what others think won’t be a priority.

"
7213,19 december 2016,gemini,"The mighty Sun is just about to move into your house of big money–investments, retirement accounts, perks, court awards, inheritances and joint business ventures. But pesky little Mercury retrogrades in the same sector today, so before you move ahead with any major financial decisions you need to make sure that the numbers add up. If possible wait until mid-January to sign papers or make your move.

"
7214,20 december 2016,gemini,"If you want to move forward with a big goal, it would be wise to make sure that the financial and tech aspects of it are in order. Mercury is retrograde in your eighth house of big money and the last thing you need is chaos with a website or funding. That being said, when the Sun enters Capricorn on Wednesday you can make significant progress with any ambition of your choosing. You will be pouring a lot of passion into it, and the week after Christmas is super for developing momentum.

"
7215,21 december 2016,gemini,"It’s time to start making some serious coin. With the Sun in the part of your chart that’s all about increasing your net worth, and mighty Mars in your career zone, you couldn’t ask for better aspects to start pulling in more cash. This isn’t about your income so much as making smart investments and managing your funds more carefully. Considering that Mercury is retrograde in this part of your chart, you should look to the past. What mistakes did you make? What did you do right? How can you increase your cash flow? Is there a business you should start, or a product that you can patent and develop?

"
7216,22 december 2016,gemini,"The level of drama in your relationships could get ratcheted up a bit with a meeting today between the passionate Moon and Jupiter. You may feel like expressing yourself openly. But can the people around you handle that? If in doubt, hold back on your opinions.

"
7217,23 december 2016,gemini,"Don’t assume that you can’t make major progress today with a career goal, because you can. A lucky Moon-Mars trine makes this a super day to send out your resume, reach out to a potential client or research that business idea that you have. Next week is actually a busy week in the cosmos with excellent aspects for forward momentum. Take advantage of it!

"
7218,24 december 2016,gemini,"Christmas is a time for dreaming and making wishes, and you will be doing just that in the days ahead. With Uranus in the house of your deepest hopes forming a superb aspect today to Saturn, you’ll be thinking about how to logically pursue your dreams. There’s no need to put yourself out on a limb–you can create a happy future and still maintain some security.

"
7219,25 december 2016,gemini,"As the new year approaches you’re feeling friskier and ready for change. You could really feel that today as Venus, in the most adventurous part of your chart, pushes you to think about how you could live life more creatively. Whether that means choosing more exotic travel destinations, taking up a hobby or adding more sizzle to a romance, start pushing past previous limits.

"
7220,26 december 2016,gemini,"Break the mold. That’s the message from the cosmos today with a rare Uranus-Jupiter opposition. Should you feel free to express yourself creatively or should you follow the rules of society? Is fitting in with the crowd really worth it? Let’s face it, most of the great artists, scientists, writers and thinkers have been misfits. But then, they’re the ones who’ve made it into the history books.

"
7221,27 december 2016,gemini,"It’s time to take charge of your mental well-being with a strong Sun-Mars aspect. If you’re plagued with negative thoughts such as jealousy, obsession or fear, you need to do some personal work and cleansing. Fortunately this is a very cathartic vibe so do whatever it takes: meditate, talk to a friend or therapist, get out in nature or study ancient philosophies such as Zen or Tao.

"
7222,28 december 2016,gemini,"Excellent day to think and talk about money–the big kind, not chump change. The cosmos wants you to get serious about building a firm foundation for the future: college funds, retirement, plenty of cash for emergencies and enough for medical bills. With a new moon tomorrow in this part of your chart, you should be examining bank statements, figuring out a way to pay down debt and considering your next career move.

"
7223,29 december 2016,gemini,"Be nice to your friends. Very nice. While you’re at it, find some new ones. Now that Uranus resumes forward motion in your house of networking, your pals and industry contacts can be a big source of help in all areas of your life. With a new moon in your house of intimacy, a friend could introduce you to a keeper. Doors could begin to open in business too, as this lunation could point out a smart investment to or profitable joint venture.

"
7224,30 december 2016,gemini,"Peace at last? A highly cathartic vibe helps you heal your tired, maybe wounded soul. Cleansing your spirit of fears, resentment and other unpleasant energy is what it’s all about today. Inspirational Neptune is in a take-charge mood, so chances are that you’ll be motivated to clear out the mental junk without much prodding from others.

"
7225,31 december 2016,gemini,"A friend may come to your aid in a rather unexpected way in the days ahead, a happy circumstance indeed! They could tip you off about a job opening, introduce you to a potential suitor, or provide sound advice about which direction to head in. A helpful way to start off the new year, don’t you think?

"
7226,1 january 2017,cancer,"With a lot of planetary activity in the most free-wheeling, optimistic part of your chart, you may feel as though there are no limits as to what you can achieve this year. And you’re right! The good news is that logical Saturn in your house of strategizing and streamlining will help you develop the good habits you need in order to get things done. Of all the signs of the zodiac, you should have more discipline and drive.

"
7227,2 january 2017,cancer,"Plans take flight! Now that Uranus has gone direct in your house of ambition, you can see the future more clearly. And with planet of ease, Venus, about to enter your optimistic ninth house of taking chances, you’ll be more ready than ever to get rolling. Just don’t forget that the devil is in the details so pay close attention to them between the 4th and the 12th.

"
7228,3 january 2017,cancer,"Green lights ahead! Charming Venus enters your free-wheeling, optimistic house of going for it. Over the next four weeks you’ll be mighty tempted to take some chances on things that you may have been skeptical about before, maybe even fearful. This old saying applies: you can’t reach a new destination unless you’re willing to set sail and leave the shore. Bon voyage, Cancer!

"
7229,4 january 2017,cancer,"The new year is under way and you’re going to be one of the most motivated signs to make things happen. It’s a smart move today to revisit projects you were working on (and prospective clients you were chasing) before the holidays, even back in October or November. Mercury backslides into your highly effective house of work assignments, bringing some of these initiatives back to life. If you’re looking for a new gig you might want to reach out to colleagues you used to work with to see if they know of any openings. This window will close by the 12th, so make haste.

"
7230,5 january 2017,cancer,"Today is not the day to rock the boat, either at home or the office. With the Moon swinging past maverick Uranus in the most authoritative part of your chart, you may be tempted to try to take control of a situation that’s gotten out of hand, or worse, pull rank. It could backfire today, but not on Saturday when the Sun and Pluto meet up. Your powers of persuasion will be based more on logic than emotion and you’ll be able to get your point across successfully.

"
7231,6 january 2017,cancer,"You’re becoming more fired up than ever to get organized and knock some things off your to-do list, and today you could become even more motivated. But now it’s not just about tying up loose ends—it’s about going after some of your bigger goals. Which is the way it should be, Cancer! The full moon on the 12th falls in your sign, wrapping up the past so that you can move on. Matters of the heart especially can take a big leap forward, so get ready.

"
7232,7 january 2017,cancer,"You’re in an awesome position to join forces with someone who’s a mover and shaker in business. A fortuitous meeting today between Pluto and the Sun could introduce you to someone who shares your aspirations in business, or take an existing alliance to a much more prosperous level. But this important planetary meeting can also affect your love life in a big way, as it takes place in your house of serious romance too! Singles could meet a new flame and attached Cancers could enjoy more soulful interchanges. This energy will last for awhile, so keep your eyes open!

"
7233,8 january 2017,cancer,"If one of your 2017 resolutions is to become more organized, today’s the day to take action! Mercury resumes direct motion in your sixth house of efficiency and good habits. If you need some help at the office or home, it’s also a smart time to consider hiring someone, even if they’re part time. Red tape and slacker co-workers may ease up a bit too, but you may have to take some action to achieve this. That’s OK–with Thursday’s full moon in your sign, you’ll be more than ready to give people a ration of whoop ass.

"
7234,9 january 2017,cancer,"First the good news. Motivator Mars and inspirational Neptune are both in the most adventurous part of your chart, helping to boost your optimism as you make grand plans for the future. Now for the warning: your intuition is off today, or your confidence may be taking a hit for some reason. This could extend into tomorrow so the smartest thing that you can do is to rely on facts and logic, not making any key decisions. That will change on Thursday, though, with the full moon in your sign. Patience.

"
7235,10 january 2017,cancer,"You may need to take control over situations that are going off the rails, whether they’re at work, home or within a group activity. With a full moon arriving this Thursday in your sign you’re not in the mood for anyone’s nonsense and stalling tactics. Try to be as diplomatic as possible though, because maverick Uranus may push you to use a bit too much force.

"
7236,11 january 2017,cancer,"You’re definitely in a good place when it comes to teamwork, whether that means sharing responsibilities with a lover, business partner, co-workers or members of a group you’re involved with. Furthermore, with dynamic Mars in Pisces, you’re able to see the bigger picture and point it out to others with ease. However, the people around you may be more than willing to let you do all the work, perhaps resorting to poor-little-me routines—or on the flip side, acting like domineering divas. With tomorrow’s full moon in Cancer, these folks had better snap out of it, stat. You’re not a mule, Cancer—don’t act like one.

"
7237,12 january 2017,cancer,"The full moon today is in your sign, Cancer, making this the perfect time to wrap up loose ends or see a plan that you’ve been working on come to a happy conclusion. However, it’s surrounded by other planets tugging and pulling on each other, making you feel as though you can’t keep everyone happy. Your career or classwork may leave you with little time for your family or vice versa. Just take one day at a time. A happy Venus-Neptune aspect suggests that you take a much needed vacation, so start planning it.

"
7238,13 january 2017,cancer,"Yesterday’s dreamy full moon in your sign may have set your desires racing as you ponder the year ahead. It was accompanied by a sweet meeting between two of the most romantic and luxe planets in the solar system, Venus and Neptune. This is definitely the time to dream big, but it’s also essential to keep it real. With the Moon in one of the most practical places in your chart this weekend, don’t lose sight of the nuts-and-bolts work that needs to be accomplished.

"
7239,14 january 2017,cancer,"The planets are shining their light on your closest partnerships, so expect things to heat up in the weeks ahead—in a good way! Mercury has just entered your commitment sector, enabling you to hold serious discussions with your amour, business partner or key client. Financial discussions can especially go well after next Thursday when the Sun enters Aquarius. There seem to be some matters that need to be resolved, though, and they deal with your level of comfort and security within the relationship. The energy over the next week is perfect for making progress.

"
7240,15 january 2017,cancer,"My way or the highway? That could be your attitude, thanks to the recent full moon in your sign. But it’s not wise to let it show with a Moon-Venus opposition today. Others may not take too kindly to being pushed around. Keep an open mind about opinions that are different than yours–you might learn something valuable.

"
7241,16 january 2017,cancer,"Lines of communication open today with a pleasant Moon-Pluto aspect. Your relationships with certain people are going through a transformative phase and it may be time to talk about what you’s like to experience and where the connection is going. This holds true for personal alliances as well as business ones, so make the decision to work well with others.

"
7242,17 january 2017,cancer,"It may sound paradoxical, but sometimes in order to have greater security and comfort you need to take a risk. Planetary influences over the next week will be pushing you out of your comfort zone a bit, which could create unease today. But it won’t last long. Tomorrow your eyes could be opened up to some new opportunities.

"
7243,18 january 2017,cancer,"There is definitely an air of expansion around you, Cancer. The cosmos is pushing you to grow, so consider taking a class, attending a seminar, hooking up with a mentor or joining a group of like-minded people. Even romance can improve with a change in attitude. Be more willing to accept another person’s faults and circumstances, as long as you maintain your self-esteem in the process.

"
7244,20 january 2017,cancer,"Sweet, sexy love! The Sun just entered Aquarius, your eighth house of intimacy and bonding. Over the next four weeks you can learn so much more about your lover and enjoy some steamy romps in the boudoir while you’re at it. This is a soulful house, not the sector of quick flings. So singles, be on the lookout—a soulmate could be out there waiting for you.

"
7245,21 january 2017,cancer,"The next week is an auspicious time to work on partnership issues, which includes business alliances. You should especially be looking at joint assets, such as investments and savings, or company revenues if you’re involved in a business partnership. Your money situation can improve dramatically in the weeks ahead, especially after the new moon on the 27th. But in order to see progress you need to get a snapshot as to where you are right now.

"
7246,22 january 2017,cancer,"Famed author Sean Covey has stated, “we become what we repeatedly do”, and this holds true for you today, Cancer. A sparkling Sun-Moon connection asks you to examine the routines you go through every day, especially where your physical and emotional health are concerned. This Friday’s new moon in Aquarius is the perfect time to begin a new habit or two that will lead to a happier, more vibrant you.

"
7247,23 january 2017,cancer,"You can do your best work alone today, and it’s advisable that you do. Other people around you may be too confused or full of themselves to be counted on for the straight story. With rational and disciplined Saturn by your side, you’ll have the good sense to see through their bluster and the desire to power through your tasks both at home and at the office.

"
7248,24 january 2017,cancer,"With structured, serious Saturn in your sixth house of efficiency you may feel as though you can take on an endless list of chores and obligations. Fueling this fire is Neptune, planet of inspiration, encouraging you to think big (as in—world domination). You’re going to have to make a short list of what’s important and needs to be accomplished first. When aggressive Mars enters your house of ambition this weekend, you may try to achieve so much that you’ll flame out. Prioritize.

"
7249,25 january 2017,cancer,"Got some issues to work out with a lover? Then today’s the day to open up the lines of communication. The passionate Moon is in your favor, swinging past verbal Mercury and change-inducing Pluto in the heavens. Considering that this Friday’s new moon is in your house of sexuality and intimacy, you certainly don’t want to be dragging any unfinished business into the future—or your boudoir.

"
7250,26 january 2017,cancer,"Hmmm…contentment and guarantees, or taking a risk? A helpful Jupiter-Venus aspect asks if you’re playing things too safe. It doesn’t matter if it’s in love, business, travel, or friendships—it’s time to spread your wings a bit and fly. Tomorrow’s new moon in your house of passion will only add gasoline to this fire, so change is coming—ready or not!

"
7251,27 january 2017,cancer,"Ready to open up a hot new chapter in intimacy? (Who the hell isn’t?) You’re in luck, Cancer, as today’s new moon falls in your house of bonding both emotionally and sexually. Couples, it seems that you need to focus more on your love life than the food shopping, the kids and the stress you’re bringing home from the office. Singles, you’re in a good place to meet someone who would really qualify as a soulmate, if you would ever take some time from your busy schedule to get out there and meet someone.

"
7252,28 january 2017,cancer,"You are in one heck of a good place to pull in some serious coin, Cancer. Today high octane Mars enters your career and ambition sector, setting the stage for progress. Yesterday a new moon occurred in your sector of financial strength. Not only will your confidence rise, your passion for succeeding will too. Don’t be surprised if someone wants to partner with you or represent you in some way.

"
7253,29 january 2017,cancer,"How passionate and strong is your romance? That’s the question with today’s Pluto-Mercury meet up. The planets are encouraging you to take a more authoritative role in partnerships, which also includes business alliances. This doesn’t mean being pushy or obnoxious, but making sure that your voice is heard as well as your emotions and ideas being respected.

"
7254,30 january 2017,cancer,"You’re stepping into a much more commanding position, Cancer, now that Mars is in your house of ambition and success.  And today the passionate Moon meets up with inspirational Neptune in the most visionary part of your chart. Toss out old ideas about what you thought was possible and look at your life through a new lens.

"
7255,31 january 2017,cancer,"Your closest relationships are in the spotlight, and you can make a lot of progress when it comes to understanding your loved ones better, not to mention important business alliances. But it’s imperative that you don’t come on too strong, a possibility with a tense Mercury-Uranus square. It may take others a while to catch up with your view of things; give them time.

"
7256,2 february 2017,cancer,"Afraid to speak up? The cosmos urges you to find your voice. There’s no point in going through life keeping everything bottled up. You have an opinion and it counts. There’s an old saying from the business world: you don’t ask, you don’t get. The same holds true for your personal life, so let others know where you’re coming from.

"
7257,3 february 2017,cancer,"Put a ring on it? Venus enters your tenth house of traditional love for an unusually long stay, blessing romantic unions. Singles, you stand a good chance of meeting someone new, especially around Valentine’s Day when long term Saturn could find you a honey in your line of work. Just know that Venus retrogrades here on March 4th, so all Cancers need to make an effort to take care of romantic issues before then, which includes your own fears and hangups.

"
7258,5 february 2017,cancer,"Hold off before diving head first into some kind of enterprise, whether it’s applying to college, taking a new job, getting married or traveling to Timbuktu. From your chart it appears that you’re overlooking key details, or that you don’t have the best habits or routines in place to carry you forward. That will change quickly, however, once Friday’s lunar eclipse occurs in one of the most structured parts of your chart. Not only will you get your act together, your dignity and self esteem will rise in the process.

"
7259,6 february 2017,cancer,"Stop and smell the roses? That’s what you should be doing over the next four months as Jupiter retrogrades in your house of comfort and family ties. You can’t be working all the time, Cancer, and you need to recharge your batteries. Allow the pace of life to slow down as you catch up with your loved ones. Don’t forget to book some time just for yourself: a massage, reading a good book before you go to bed at night, or spending time in nature. You’re going to need the rest as Friday’s lunar eclipse falls in your income sector, making you motivated to earn more. Balance is the key.

"
7260,7 february 2017,cancer,"Felling emo? You might be, considering that verbal Mercury just entered your soulful eighth house. Intense feelings may bubble up to the surface over the next three weeks, but that’s happening for a reason. It’s time to sort them out so that you can develop a greater sense of internal comfort and security. This Friday’s lunar eclipse will only intensify your desire to build a strong, serene foundation.
 

"
7261,8 february 2017,cancer,"Tread cautiously around business partners, big clients and bosses as the emotional Moon may cause you to be far more vocal than is good for you. Someone in a position of rank may do or say something that sets you off, but keep calm and carry on. Thursday and Friday are much better days for speaking your mind. Heck, you can even impress these folks then and see more cash coming your way down the road.

"
7262,9 february 2017,cancer,"A smart money-making strategy could reveal itself over the next three days, although you can help matters along by doing some brainstorming and research. If you’re considering finding a job elsewhere, this is an excellent day to put out some feelers, as is tomorrow. The lunar eclipse on Friday falls in your income sector and it’s a honey. There could be a shakeup at the office, or a sudden decision on your part to make a big move–such as switching industries.

"
7263,10 february 2017,cancer,"Ah, the sweet sound of crisp green Benjamins rustling between your fingertips. You’re the envy of the zodiac, Cancer, now that a series of eclipses begins tonight in your income sector. Between now and 2019 your earnings can grow exponentially, provided that you put in the effort. Stellar aspects surrounding tonight’s lunation are helpful in landing new assignments or even a new position. Erratic Uranus is acting up (in your favor!), indicating that a deal or job offer could come your way that you weren’t expecting. Eclipses can be felt for six months, so hustle between now and August 7th.

"
7264,11 february 2017,cancer,"Keep your antennae up today, Cancer. Last night’s lunar eclipse in Leo was all about making more money, and today you might hear about an opportunity that will help make that happen. Your aspects for landing new clients or a promotion are excellent, as is developing new income streams if you’re self employed. This isn’t a quick payoff of some chump change; we’re talking good money over the long haul.

"
7265,12 february 2017,cancer,"Need to make a decision? Then wait a few days as confusing Neptune is swirling its mist. It’s also a smart move to keep your mouth shut today for the same reason. You run the risk of making a statement that’s based more on emotions than facts, which can come back to bite you later on. Tuesday is a far more practical and strategic time to voice your opinions.

"
7266,13 february 2017,cancer,"Try a little tenderness. Someone close to you may need a delicate touch, and you might not be able to approach them the same way you usually do. But you won’t have to tiptoe around forever. This aspect passes quickly and by tomorrow you’ll be able to tell it like it is.

"
7267,14 february 2017,cancer,"With the Sun in your house of passion and libido, and Mars and Venus in your take-charge sector, you’re definitely not in “shrinking violet” mode, Cancer. No, this is more about being lusty, loving life and sharing it with a person who also knows how to live la vida loca. But with Jupiter in your warm and fuzzy domestic sector you’ll also want to nest. Seek balance.

"
7268,15 february 2017,cancer,"Reminiscing about the past, especially fond family memories, is the order of the day. The cosmos reminds you that there is more to life than work, something that you need to be mindful of with aggressive Mars in your ambition sector. Start carving out more quality time for your family, lover or just for yourself. Don’t worry, you’ll still have time left for going after your goals.

"
7269,16 february 2017,cancer,"Working with others to make progress is the name of the game over the next week. Just don’t appear too anxious to seal a deal, or push others to make a decision. Your confidence speaks volumes. The people around you will sense it and come around to your way of thinking.

"
7270,17 february 2017,cancer,"Feeling emo? It wouldn’t be surprising, especially when it comes to your relationships with loved ones. The Moon is churning up your feelings and you might not be seeing things in a realistic light. This will change by Monday, when you will suddenly feel more in control of your alliances, but for now don’t make any major decisions.

"
7271,18 february 2017,cancer,"Is it time to expand your knowledge base? Now that the Sun is in your house of learning and expanding your horizons, you might be thinking about signing up for a class or getting licensed in a new trade. Maybe a trip abroad would provide you with a fresh perspective, or reading part of a good book every night before you go to bed. Even the most talented CEOs, surgeons and artists are always perfecting their skills. You don’t stop learning until you die.

"
7272,20 february 2017,cancer,"Brainiac Uranus is lively today, stirring things up in your career sector. You could stumble upon a smart way to earn more money or develop greater financial stability. Just don’t expect everyone around you to be as excited as you are, especially on Wednesday. That’s OK. From your chart it doesn’t look like you need anyone’s approval or help. You’re on a roll, so don’t let anyone or anything slow you down.

"
7273,21 february 2017,cancer,"“Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love.” So sang Phil Collins back in the day (and he was covering the Mindbenders’ version from 1964!). Well, that’s what the cosmos has in store for you Cancer–a shagadelic, groovy kind of love that comes with a soulmate attached. That includes you too, singles, so don’t despair. Today’s trine will help you, along with the upcoming solar eclipse on Sunday.

"
7274,22 february 2017,cancer,"Where there’s a will, there’s a way. Assertive Mars is powering its way through your house of ambition, usually a beneficial situation. Today, however, there could be pushback against your forward momentum from someone who seems determined to stand in your way. The key is to maintain your authority and progress without going bats**t on this individual. Temper, temper.

"
7275,23 february 2017,cancer,"With so much activity going on in your big-picture thinking sector, you could be losing sight of the details that need to be handled. Chunk down larger projects into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Your passion will rise and your stress will decrease.

"
7276,24 february 2017,cancer,"Nothing of any value has been achieved without passion, and the dedication and zeal you bring to important aspects of your life will pay off. A happy lunar aspect helps you dig deep into that wellspring of inspiration so that you can pursue your goals with well-directed intensity.

"
7281,3 march 2017,cancer,"Mixed signals? Try to reach an agreement today with a lover or business partner as to the direction you’re heading in. Otherwise control battles may erupt over the next four weeks. Venus will be retrograding in your house of authority on Saturday, which might challenge your self-confidence.

"
7282,4 march 2017,cancer,"Keep your cool, Cancer! Slowdowns may occur in your career as profitable Venus goes retrograde in your ambition sector for the next month. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t make progress. You’re actually in a super spot for coming up with some interesting ideas that could take your career and income to a higher level. They may take a bit longer than you’d like, but start working on them. After the 13th momentum will build.

"
7283,5 march 2017,cancer,"Practicality rules with structured Saturn telling you to draw up an action plan for your ambitions. It’s not enough to dream it, talk about it or create vision boards–you need to get real about timelines, resources you’ll need and your mindset. Fortunately assertive Mars is in your house of ambition, lighting a fire under you to get moving.

"
7284,6 march 2017,cancer,"An idea that seems a little “out there” may actually work, Cancer. Brilliant little Mercury and the fiery Sun meet up in the most original, free-thinking part of your chart, so some interesting brainstorms could come your way. Considering that assertive Mars enters your house of teamwork this Thursday, you might consider crowdfunding or collaborating with others to turn an idea into reality.

"
7285,7 march 2017,cancer,"Stepping into your power is in the cards today, but people around you might make a fuss. What’s their problem? Are they used to getting their way? Oh well! They’ve been getting away with this for far too long. With Venus now retrograde in your house of authority, it’s time for you to consider the ways in which you’ve given away your power in the past.

"
7286,8 march 2017,cancer,"Teaming up with other people never looked so good, Cancer! Whether it’s for love, business, a charity, or friendship, this week is super for making connections. The best part is that the people who will enter your world will be more open minded and optimistic than the folks you’ve known in the past. Get out there and mingle.

"
7287,9 march 2017,cancer,"It takes a village! That should be your mantra over the next six weeks as Mars has just entered your house of networking and camaraderie. This is an excellent time to join forces with like-minded people, whether it’s for a charitable cause or your career. Seek the advice of savvy experts, and rub shoulders with movers and shakers. Group efforts can really pick up steam, but watch out for infighting and team players who seem to be more interested in their own agenda than the good of the group.

"
7288,10 march 2017,cancer,"From your chart it appears that you need to think on more global terms, Cancer. Don’t set your sights too low. Instead, raise them! Today’s a good one for thinking and talking about earning more, but you’ll have to change your mindset first. Do things the same way you’ve always done them and you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.

"
7289,11 march 2017,cancer,"You’re about to enter a phase in which you can relax more, emotionally that is. Stressful situations and dramas will start to recede, and you could start feeling that today. Tomorrow’s full moon falls in one of the most social parts of your chart, so start making plans for brunch, cocktails, movie dates and neighborhood get togethers. Travel is also on the planets’ agenda.

"
7290,12 march 2017,cancer,"Tonight’s full moon could bring news that you’ve been waiting for, Cancer. It also sets the stage for some awesome strategy sessions. But a difficult Mercury-Saturn aspect warns that you don’t go too big and bold too fast. Take your time with your thesis, manuscript, website launch, relationship or exercise program. While it appears that you’ll be receiving the support of people around you, you still need to take baby steps and do things right.

"
7291,13 march 2017,cancer,"It’s time to freshen up your image on the career front, Cancer. Mercury has just entered your house of ambition, so polish up your resume, portfolio or thesis.

Today the planets tell you to slow down and make plans to hang out with your friends. This is more than having fun and sharing confidences; the people in your world could shape your path in the years to come, in unusual and positive ways.

"
7294,17 march 2017,cancer,"First the good news: the Moon and Neptune in the most creative parts of your chart are sparking up all sorts of bright ideas. Now for the downside: you need to get real about them. How much money will they cost? Are there enough hours in a day to complete them? If not, so you need to delegate or hire someone? If you need the cooperation of others, will they sign on? This is true whether you’re looking to get engaged or invent the next Spanx. When the Sun enters Aries next week you’ll be able to figure it all out.

"
7296,19 march 2017,cancer,"An extremely active period is about to begin tomorrow when the Sun enters Aries, the most ambitious part of your chart. Today the Moon conjuncts Saturn, telling you that in order to achieve success in any  area of your life that you need to toss out ineffective routines and time wasters (which could include people). Fortunately Saturn is the planet of logic and discipline so whatever changes you make should get locked in with ease.

"
7297,20 march 2017,cancer,"Your career catches fire now that the Sun is in Aries, your tenth house of ambition.

"
7298,21 march 2017,cancer,"Your head and your heart could be working at cross purposes today and for the rest of the week, for that matter. It may be difficult to make decisions about key issues. This is definitely a time when you need to create a short list of what’s important. Otherwise you’ll be torn and matters that need to be settled will drag on.

"
7299,22 march 2017,cancer,"With both the authoritative Sun and magnetic Venus in your career house you should have no trouble in impressing higher-ups with your know how. Today is a good time to initiate conversations, but wait until next week to really get going with initiatives. A tense T-square tomorrow and Friday could create mixed signals and power struggles.

"
7300,23 march 2017,cancer,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Cancer, something that will become apparent with a tough Mercury-Pluto square. Someone may place demands on your time and they could be pushy about it. Remember that with the Sun in the most ambitious part of your chart that you need to take care of #1. There’s nothing wrong with drawing boundaries.

"
7301,24 march 2017,cancer,"You’re quite an ambitious individual these days, what with the Sun and Mercury blazing a path through your house of success. But you could be hampered today by the demands of others, especially family. It’s also possible that the demands of your job are such that you feel guilty about not spending enough time with the family unit, not to mention relaxing on your own. Well, your success streak ain’t gonna stop anytime soon, especially with next week’s new moon in this sector. But you really do need some down time, so try to schedule it.

"
7302,25 march 2017,cancer,"Making headway in a romance is a strong possibility with a happy Sun-Venus connection. You and a lover may finally reach a decision as to where you’re headed. Singles, you could meet a stable, mature (and possibly older) person who is well established both financially and socially. This is no time for fly-by-night love affairs or partners who can’t commit. Not satisfied in love? Then Tuesday’s new moon could prompt you to move on.

"
7303,26 march 2017,cancer,"A sudden burst of inspiration could hit you to go after a goal, or to switch up the way you’ve been trying to achieve one already. What’s up? Inspirational Neptune is on the job, sending you insight from the heavens. If you need to seek advice from a mentor, or think that attending a seminar might help, get moving. From your chart it appears that other people will be crucially important when it comes to achieving your aims.

"
7304,27 march 2017,cancer,"You’re the most goal oriented sign of the zodiac these days thanks to planets occupying your ambitious tenth house, and today is loaded with positive energy.

Tomorrow’s new moon kicks off a wonderful phase which could bring results by the time of your birthday.

"
7305,28 march 2017,cancer,"You’re on fire, Cancer! With the Sun, Moon, Venus and Uranus all packed into your ambition sector, there will be no shortage of ideas and goals to pursue on your part. If finding new love or improving an existing relationship is on that list, you’re in luck. Today’s new moon is well aspected by amorous Venus. Over the next six months your romantic situation could change rather nicely, provided you’re willing to put in some effort.

"
7306,29 march 2017,cancer,"If you’ve been pushing yourself too hard—and from your chart it appears like that’s the case—your health may be taking a beating. A strong Mercury-Saturn link tells you to develop better habits, such as drinking more water, eating more vegetables, going to bed earlier and working out more frequently. Don’t take your health for granted; there’s only a finite amount of energy we have each day and it can get depleted.

"
7307,30 march 2017,cancer,"Optimistic Jupiter is encouraging you to seek peace of mind, especially at home. Your relationships with kids, a lover and family members may need some mending, but today is probably not the best for expecting results. A tense Jupiter-Pluto square could bring out a power struggle in which one of you tries to outmaneuver the other, with hurt feelings resulting. Mercury enters the teamwork sector tomorrow, though, so over the next few weeks you should be able to work things out.

"
7308,31 march 2017,cancer,"Technology rules for you over the next few weeks, thanks to Mercury joining Mars in the eleventh house of the digital world.

"
7309,1 april 2017,cancer,"You’ve been pushing hard with your career and other ambitions, Cancer, but you can expect some relief tomorrow when Venus retrogrades into a far more relaxed location. Plan a vacation or some exciting weekend options for the upcoming month. Sign up for a class or seminar that’s just for fun. Daydream and then take some actions on the “fantasies” that pop into your head. By mid-April you’ll be rested and ready to socialize more.

"
7310,2 april 2017,cancer,"Any time you’re trying to get a plan off the ground you need to be cognizant that along the journey you’ll have to adjust things. Nothing ever goes exactly to plan, so flexibility and the openness to change your viewpoint and strategy are key. Over the next two weeks you’ll need to revise a goal, project or even an opinion. Venus has just begun to retrograde in your house of learning big lessons, so pay attention.

"
7311,3 april 2017,cancer,"Your creative mojo is off the charts today with a superb Moon-Neptune connection. You’ll have the ability to think big and bold—but that doesn’t mean that others around you will be able to appreciate your genius. A boss or client especially may resistant to your ideas. Actually they may have a point; with Saturn about to retrograde it’s not necessarily that the idea is bad, but it needs to be fleshed out in greater detail.

"
7312,4 april 2017,cancer,"Unexpected criticism from a boss, client, parent or other authority figure could rattle your confidence today, Cancer. The trouble is that you may react emotionally with the passionate Moon in your sign. This energy continues into the weekend, so put on your seatbelt. The good news is that the full moon on the 11th will help you sort out your feelings and put some of this drama to rest.

"
7313,5 april 2017,cancer,"Don’t be so tough on yourself, Cancer. A part of you wants to follow the rules and maintain perfect habits while another part of you wants to break free. The good news is that you’ll be able to do both with a smart Moon-Neptune connection. Don’t kid yourself–even people who seem like free spirits have routines and habits that enable them to live life a little larger than everyone else.

"
7314,6 april 2017,cancer,"Take a deep breath and slow down, Cancer. Structured Saturn is now moving backward in your house of productivity, forcing you to examine your methods when it comes to work flow both at home and the office. It’s time to get a handle on unfinished projects, overflowing e-mail accounts and inefficient methods. But if you put in the effort and make changes, you’ll live a far less stressful lifestyle.

"
7315,7 april 2017,cancer,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Cancer, something that you need to be mindful of. A tense Sun-Jupiter opposition will remind you of that fact. Between your career demands and those of your family, you appear to be spread too thin. And what about taking some time for yourself? Slow down, schedule some free time and examine your priorities.

"
7316,8 april 2017,cancer,"Practical matters must be addressed this weekend, regardless as to what your romantic partner or pals may want to do. You may need to come down hard on folks who’d rather play than get things done, but watch that you don’t push too hard. The approaching full moon in your sector of comfort and domesticity is making you aware that routines need to be followed so that life can run more smoothly.

"
7317,9 april 2017,cancer,"Tech success could become stalled as Mercury retrogrades today in your digital sector. Hold off (if you can) on launching a website, app, social media blitz or internet marketing campaign. The same is true for online dating—a dicey proposition between now and the 20th when Mercury goes direct! But the delays can help you if you take the time to perfect everything that you’re putting out there on the internet.

"
7318,10 april 2017,cancer,"Your self-confidence gets a boost with a serene Moon-Jupiter connection. You’re learning that your dignity and self esteem are not dependent upon the opinions of others, even those who are closest to your heart. Tomorrow’s full moon will really drive this point home as you may decide to cut ties with those who seem determined to put you down.

"
7319,11 april 2017,cancer,"Creating a balance between helping loved ones but maintaining your own space may not be easy, but it’s worth it. The full moon in the most emotional part of your chart will encourage you to develop a more deep seated sense of security. However, family and loved ones may be tugging at you with their issues. You must figure out how to maintain your own peace while helping them.

"
7320,12 april 2017,cancer,"Is there something that you’ve been dying to try or do–but something held you back? The planets are encouraging you to take a bold risk. Release your fears or worries about what other people will think. When Venus goes direct this weekend, nothing will get in your way.

"
7321,13 april 2017,cancer,"With the Moon in your house of talent, now is a good time to develop yours. Sign up for a class, find a mentor, read a book or model someone else’s success. A superb Sun-Uranus meeting on Friday is just the ticket for taking a chance on some bold new aspirations. Make sure that you’ve got the chops to go after them.

"

Sometimes ya just gotta break the rules and start doing things differently, and that’s what the cosmos is suggesting you try!

"
7323,16 april 2017,cancer,"They say that if you aim for the moon and you miss, you’ll still land among the stars. That phrase is perfect for you today as a happy Venus-Mars connection urges you to take a bold risk by thinking out of the box. Venus provides you with the vision and Mars the motivation. When the Sun enters Taurus in a few days your momentum will only increase.

"
7324,17 april 2017,cancer,"Trying to close a deal or land a position with more responsibility? Then today’s your day, Cancer. The authoritative Sun in your ambition sector puts you in the driver’s seat. New clients or projects could come your way, thanks to the hard work you’ve been putting in lately. When the Sun enters Taurus this week it sets up a four-week period in which networking is the way to go.

"
7325,18 april 2017,cancer,"Controlling your emotions is sometimes wise, but not necessarily today. Your loved ones need to hear how much you care about them. Try to mend fences now if there are outstanding issues, because once Pluto retrogrades on Thursday old resentments and problems will come bubbling to the surface.

"
7326,19 april 2017,cancer,"Who’s got your back? That’s the big question as the powerful Sun enters your house of camaraderie and networking. But with Pluto and Mercury about to retrograde in the houses that deal with romantic partners and business associates, you’ll need to tread a careful path to suss who has your best interests at heart. Fortunately Mars enters your house of intuition this Friday, so it shouldn’t be too hard to do!
 
 

"
7327,20 april 2017,cancer,"Trust issues, power plays, head games—if these are present in your romance they need to go bye-bye. The same holds true for singles who have burned in the past with these crummy vibes. Strong man Pluto retrogrades in your commitment sector, asking you to examine where you give up your power—or where you might be abusing it. Over the next few months do some inner work and release the memories associated with past mistakes, and put people on notice that you’re not going to be their doormat.

"
7328,21 april 2017,cancer,"If you’re smart, Cancer, you’ll start to slow down and take better care of yourself. Mars has just entered the quietest, most nurturing part of your chart, demanding that you soothe your rattled nerves and carve out some “me” time. It’s also wise to take a good long look at the path you’re on, both in your career and romance. Pluto and Mercury went retrograde yesterday in these sectors. If you have pent up anger or fears in these areas you need to release them and move on.

"
7329,22 april 2017,cancer,"Sometimes ya just gotta get the grunt work done, Cancer, and this weekend is the time to attend to it…no matter how much you want to play! Laundry won’t wash itself, nor will the basement get cleaned up on its own. Its also a smart time to tackle work and e-mails that have been piling up at the office. Don’t worry. Next Tuesday’s new moon falls in your house of camaraderie, so there are plenty of dinners out, cocktails and movie nights in your future.

"
7330,23 april 2017,cancer,"If your love life has become dull, or if you feel that life in general has become a snooze, it’s time to shake things up. A happy Venus-Moon meet-up in the heavens urges you to get out of a rut and try new or exciting things that will make your heart sing. Mars just entered your twelfth house, the place where we take good care of ourselves and regroup. Get out there and have some fun this weekend.

7331,24 april 2017,cancer,"Hustle. That’s the word o’ the day, Cancer. Mercury in your career house forms a fabulous angle with stable Saturn, indicating that initiatives that you start today will have some serious long term potential. Mercury is  retrograde, so you can’t expect cash, new clients and job offers to pour in right away. The key is to get some new things started and give them time to grow.

"
7332,25 april 2017,cancer,"Take this job and shove it? Erratic Uranus is acting up in your career sector today, sparking changes that you may not have seen coming. But this is a good thing as the genius planet is forming a terrific angle with Saturn. You could make the decision to find employment elsewhere, apply for a promotion or start your own company. A new client or project with excellent long term potential might land on your desk. Get ready to run with whatever happens as Venus cruises into your career sector on Friday.

"
7333,26 april 2017,cancer,"It’s not what you know, it’s who you know, and that’s the message behind today’s new moon, Cancer. While you’re being encouraged to make more plans to party with the tribe, you should be working your contact list for other reasons. Profitable Venus is about to enter your house of career and ambition, so reach out to former co-workers and bosses. Find a mentor or coach who can provide you with fresh ideas about how to achieve all of your goals, not just those that are work-related. May can be a big month if you start connecting now.

"
7334,27 april 2017,cancer,"Considering that yesterday’s new moon fell in your house of networking, you should be looking to meet as many new people as possible, not to mention connecting with existing contacts. Today’s perfect for talking about forming a business collaboration that will take you far. Don’t be shy about reaching out to folks who are movers and shakers, people whom you think might be “above” your level. They may be more accessible than you realize.

"
7335,28 april 2017,cancer,"Need to have a serious talk with someone about the future? Then hop to it as magnetic Venus just entered your house of structure and authority. This is no time to sit around and hope that things will come together by themselves. With Venus on the scene you won’t have to resort to threats or manipulation. Just be frank and let others know that you need an answer.

"
7336,29 april 2017,cancer,"Routines, protocols,habits—they may all be getting on your nerves today! Chances are that you are not  going to want to stick to your diet, clean out the basement, food shop or anything else that screams of discipline. That’s because the emotional Moon is creating a mini rebellion against play-by-the-rules Saturn. But this passes quickly, so whether you decide to play hooky or not this weekend is entirely up to you.

"
7337,30 april 2017,cancer,"New faces could come into your world this week provided you’re open to meeting new people. As a matter of fact the next three weeks are super for expanding your contact list, a bonus for your personal life as well as for business. Considering that profits planet Venus just entered your career sector, think about whom you can connect with. You might be surprised to discover that influential folks are willing to open doors for you.

"
7338,1 may 2017,cancer,"Tread carefully around authority figures as the Moon squares unpredictable Uranus. They could be set off pretty easily and you certainly don’t want to be the person who provokes them. Even if you keep a low profile, a boss or muckety-muck (judge, cop, government official) could hurl some criticism or make unrealistic demands. Fortunately this is a short lived situation. Keep calm and carry on.

"
7339,2 may 2017,cancer,"You’ll be able to breathe a sigh of relief soon, Cancer. Mercury is about to resume direct motion in your house of goals and career tomorrow, loosening up logjams and helping you proceed with greater confidence. But the cosmos throws you a bone today in the form of a profitable Moon-Mars connection. Quietly research some new options for increasing your income or starting your own business.

"
7340,3 may 2017,cancer,"Vamanos! Surge forward with your plans and ambitions, Cancer—Mercury is now direct in this part of the sky. Your best path to success is to include other people in your plans rather than trying to go solo. With the Sun in your house of networking you should be working your contact list, attending seminars and parties and finding a savvy mentor who can help you. It doesn’t matter whether you’re looking for a new spouse or a new job: contacts count.

"
7341,4 may 2017,cancer,"You may need to tiptoe around a love partner today or switch up your methods of communicating. The same holds true for bosses and authority figures. If you’re used to being straightforward, holding back information may be better. Always on the passive side? Then come on a little stronger, but carefully. There’s a time and place for everything and your job is to figure out the best MO for getting your point across.

"
7342,5 may 2017,cancer,"If you’ve been at odds with a friend, lover or family member today’s the day to make amends. Your peace of mind is so important, thanks to serene Jupiter occupying one of the most emotional parts of your chart. If you don’t take care of matters they’ll just eat away at you, so why put yourself through that? Get it over and done with and feel better, about yourself and the other person.

"
7343,6 may 2017,cancer,"Talk is cheap, Cancer. Stop talking about getting your body in shape. Quit saying that tomorrow you’ll start the diet. Of all the signs of the zodiac, your sign stands the best chance of getting fit and staying there. That’s because strict Saturn, the planet of maintaining discipline, has been in your house of wellness for some time now. Take advantage of this—it won’t be back for another 30 years!

"
7344,7 may 2017,cancer,"You’re a home body by nature, and today’s Moon-Jupiter meet up is going to create the desire to nest at home. But adventure is calling also, thanks to glamorous Neptune in your travel sector. Start searching for exotic locations to visit. In the meantime, work on turning your home into a luxurious place to come back to at the end of a long day.

"
7345,8 may 2017,cancer,"A battle may be brewing between your work responsibilities and your personal life, Cancer. A moody Moon-Mercury opposition today could prompt you to let someone have it. Think before you speak, especially if you’re considering venting at the boss or a key client. This energy builds as Wednesday approaches, by the way. But if it’s a lover who refuses to honor the effort you put in to your career, it may be time to set them straight.

"
7346,9 may 2017,cancer,"There’s power in numbers and the planets are advising you to join forces with savvy folks rather than going it alone. A stellar Sun-Pluto aspect puts you in touch with movers and shakers, whether they’re from the business world, volunteerism or the social strata. Don’t be surprised if someone wants to partner with you (which includes marriage, dontcha know). If you think that hooking up with a mentor or coach is a smart move then start making inquiries.

"
7347,10 may 2017,cancer,"Do you want your life to look like an episode of General Hospital  or The Guiding Light ?  No? Then you’re going to have to tread carefully, Cancer, as tonight’s full moon falls in the most dramatic part of your chart. Sure, this is also the house of romance, flirting, fun, culture and entertainment. But erratic Uranus is acting up, perhaps making you a little more demanding than usual. On the other hand, if you’re used to being a doormat this may be a good thing!

"
7348,11 may 2017,cancer,"Establishing long term plans with your amour is the order of the day, Cancer. An auspicious Sun-Pluto trine helps the two of you get everything out in the open. You won’t be settling for table scraps either, so be prepared to speak openly about what you truly desire. Singles, this is a terrific aspect for meeting someone new, someone who can go the distance. And your options for meeting them are wide open: an introduction from a friend, online or bumping into someone in a public place.

"
7349,12 may 2017,cancer,"Got something on your mind? Then get it out in the open, Cancer, as a superb Mars-Jupiter aspect helps you release pent up feelings. Singles, you may finally feel vulnerable enough to open up your heart and get involved with someone, important if you’ve been shying away for fear of getting hurt. Coupled up crabs can have some serious talk about the direction they’re heading in, especially when it comes to matters surrounding children (conceiving them, custody, adoption and so on) or housing. There’s a building feeling of optimism, so take it and run with it!

"
7350,13 may 2017,cancer,"Sometimes you need to step back from your friendships and groups that you’re involved in so that you can see how you fit in to the grander scheme of things. Maybe you’ve outgrown certain relationships and it’s time to move on. Or you realize that you’re being taken for granted by the team at the office or your pals. If everyone comes running to you with their problems but can’t seem to be there when you need a shoulder to cry on, you need to wake up. But you may not need to part company: a serious talk may do the trick.

"
7351,14 may 2017,cancer,"With so much planetary action in the deepest, most psychological part of your chart you may be wondering if you’re turning into a basket case. You’re not. But you are being encouraged to let go of mental kaka so that you can: (a) enjoy life more, which includes taking some interesting risks and (b) feel more content and serene while you’re having that fun. Don’t worry, with serious, logical Saturn in the most practical part of your chart you won’t do anything really stupid, and all of your work will get done.

"
7352,15 may 2017,cancer,"Power struggles within a close relationship? Or maybe you just need to revise the roles you play or the responsibilities you share with someone, such as a spouse or business partner. With intelligent Mercury just about to enter your house of collaboration and networking, you need to make sure that you’re not taking on too much. There will be new people coming into your life, people with wisdom and influence. Make sure that you have the time and patience to connect with them.

"
7353,16 may 2017,cancer,"Forging dynamic connections, becoming part of a new crew, socializing like mad—yup, it’s all possible now that chatty little Mercury is in your house of networking. Use this energy to expand your contact list. This sector also covers technology, so the next three weeks are super for getting a website ready for prime time, coding an app, preparing a social media campaign and even finding a lover online.

"
7354,17 may 2017,cancer,"Facing up to your fears becomes a lot easier today with a sweet lunar aspect. Mark Twain famously said, “I’ve had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened.” The humorist was pointing out that we humans love to create mental dramas when often there’s nothing to get worked up about. Even if there is, how does excessive fear and worrying help?

"
7355,18 may 2017,cancer,"Feeling crabby, Cancer? You might! The two most optimistic planets, Venus and Jupiter, are at odds in your houses of home and career. There simply may not be enough hours in the day to handle the responsibilities from both. If you’ve taken on too much, or you’re the go-to person, it may be time to let others know that you need some help. Cut back on some of your commitments. Carve out time for yourself while you’re at it.

"
7356,19 may 2017,cancer,"They say that rules are meant to be broken. In your case, Cancer, you should be rethinking the way you go about your daily grind at work, not to mention your career path. A superb meeting between maverick Uranus and disciplined Saturn urges you to think in a fresh new way. Are you in the right occupation? If now, what can you do now to make a change? How can you streamline your tasks at the office? With Uranus involved, change can happen quickly. A job offer may suddenly come your way, or you might make a fast decision about a career change. Perhaps you need to set your sights on bigger clients or deals. Consider your options.

"
7357,21 may 2017,cancer,"Your motivation to gain control over situations in your life increases today as the Moon is in one of the most authoritative and confident parts of your chart. But first you have to take out the trash. The mental trash, that is. This week’s new moon is a game changer as it occurs in the sector that governs emotional closure and healing. Do the inner work before embarking on the next phase of your life.

"
7358,22 may 2017,cancer,"Your ability to make some well thought out decisions about your career goes up as profitable Venus conjuncts the Moon. But don’t rush anything as this Thursday’s new moon falls in the most reflective part of your chart. You may decide to cut ties with existing clients or business partners in order to make room for some new ones that suit you better. Keep your cards close to your vest and see what other options you have.

"
7359,23 may 2017,cancer,"A lot of self-help gurus promise overnight peace, serenity, habit breaking and developing a successful mindset. But is that the way life really works? Not in your world, Cancer! Aggressive Mars in the house that deals with mental and emotional “cleansing” is encouraging you to cut negative thoughts and toxic ties, but the problem is that the red planet wants instant results. On the other side of the heavens, disciplinarian Saturn (who’s older and wiser, thank you) tells you that achieving these states is a day-by-day thing. After all, you don’t stop smoking for one day and call yourself a non-smoker, right? Time is the best judge.

"
7360,24 may 2017,cancer,"If you want to make progress with a certain relationship, today’s a smart time to work on it. That’s because the emotional Moon is in a “team spirit” kind of a mood. Make sure that you keep that attitude going over the next few days and be up front in a friendly way about your needs. Playing the passive aggressive game, or trying to guilt people into getting what you want isn’t going to fly.

"
7361,25 may 2017,cancer,"You’re currently going through a rather stressful time as the cosmos is trying to help you cleanse the negative “kaka” from your life. Kaka takes many forms, as we all know, from obnoxious exes to our own bad habits to not enjoying our job. But today’s new moon is the terrific antidote, a lunation that will inspire you to clean house (or the toilet, as it were). From your chart it appears that one of the first things you need to do is to be honest about the people in your world. Any frenemies there, or malcontents? If that’s the case you have some decisions to make.

"
7362,26 may 2017,cancer,"You may have been locked in a battle of wills with someone, and finessing it probably hasn’t been easy. Fortunately some helpful aspects arise today and over the weekend that will enable you to gain better control of the situation. This primarily comes from within as your sense of dignity and authority rises. Forget what you’ve heard about the meek inheriting the earth. You need to stand up for yourself.

"
7363,27 may 2017,cancer,"Simplicity is underrated in our over the top culture, but people in the East have long known about the benefits of paring back. It’s time to declutter. Cut back on your activities and the amount of new things you buy. Stick to the essentials. This not only applies to your outer world but also your inner world. Does your mind need to be going in 20 directions at once? No? Then find new techniques for decluttering your brain as well.

"
7364,28 may 2017,cancer,"The recent new moon may have encouraged you to go within and do some much needed pampering and nurturing, but today’s no time for cocooning at home. A sparkling Mercury-Neptune aspect tells you to get out there and mingle. The contacts you make could end up being quite beneficial: think matchmaker or potential business associate. Work your connections as best you can into the first week of June.

"
7365,29 may 2017,cancer,"Trying to do everything by yourself can lead to resentment and burnout. So….stop being an enabler, the family consigliere, the go-to person at the office, or the friend who’s always there for others but when you need a hug there’s no one around. Mars is in a place which could make you feel isolated, and if you decide to go the smug little saint route you can. But Saturn tells you to look after your own needs right now.

"
7366,30 may 2017,cancer,"This is a smart time to push hard with a goal you want to achieve, but keep your plans to yourself. Schedule job interviews, a meeting with an attorney or a mentor who can help you. There are some fast (but good) changes coming as you’ve been working hard and making a good impression on people who are decision makers. They can help you but for now you need to keep your conversations under wraps.

"
7367,31 may 2017,cancer,"Mending fences with the people in your world becomes easier today with a helpful Mercury aspect. You may come to the conclusion that you need to be more of a team player, even if you don’t feel like it! But cooperation will get you further in the future than going it alone. Besides, from your chart it looks like some of the people you will connect with will have some sage advice for you.

"
7368,1 june 2017,cancer,"If you’ve been yearning for more structure in your life and less chaos, you’ll be happy with today’s Venus-Saturn trine. This goes for romantic unions as well as professional pursuits,  not to mention going after other big goals such as weight loss. It’s not that the outside world is going to suddenly change and obstacles disappear; this is more of a mental shift in which you become determined to get things done regardless  of the chaos. As they say, you can’t stop a locomotive, and that’s what you’re going to become.

"
7369,1 june 2016,cancer,"Hold your horses. Big plans may hit a snag today as the Sun squares Neptune. It appears that not all systems are go, and that you may need to go back and reach closure on certain topics before progress can be made. So if your relationship is a bit of a mess right now, you might need couples’ therapy before taking the next step. Check your business plan for holes before you do a launch. Make sure that you’re the person you need to be emotionally before you take on a big role.

"
7370,2 june 2017,cancer,"There’s a lot to be said about enjoying a peaceful life at home, whether you’re single and living solo or married with kids. A sweet Sun-Jupiter aspect allows you to work things out with family members and loved ones, even if they don’t live under the same roof as you. You may need to lay down some practical rules and boundaries about household chores or the kind of behavior you expect, but with next week’s full moon occurring in your ultra-practical sixth house, that shouldn’t be a problem.

"
7371,2 june 2016,cancer,"What big career dreams fill your head, Cancer? The Moon in the house of optimism and big picture thinking will stir you up to think about that today, and it forms a magnificent angle with inspirational Neptune. Better yet? Your money and financial security houses are a part of this planetary conversation.

"
7372,3 june 2017,cancer,"Sometimes we realize in the blink of an eye that a previously cherished goal is not meaningful to us anymore. Or a brilliant idea or new dream pops into our head, and we feel that we must pursue it. That could happen today, Cancer, as a fabulous meeting of Venus and Uranus occurs in the heavens. Toss out outmoded ways of thinking and set a new course. This could be in any area of your life, by the way, from love to career to health. And don’t be surprised if you find yourself yearning for the more traditional things in life, such as a secure and happy marriage or a hefty retirement account. These two planets meet in the house of old-fashioned values.

"
7373,3 june 2016,cancer,"Watch your words! A tense Grand Cross in the heavens wants you to be careful as to what you say, type, print or publish. That’s because the Sun and Venus are stationed in your secluded twelfth house of confidentiality. Problem is, the ego-driven Sun may push you to blab something that’s not ripe yet for general dissemination. Serious Saturn on the other side of the solar system is saying, “Don’t even think  of going there.” This is especially true of any work or contract-related matters. Keep a lid on it. Remember the Wizard of Oz? “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.”

"
7374,4 june 2017,cancer,"Get out of my way! Yup, you’re on a roll, Cancer. Red hot Mars just entered your sign, making you the guy or gal to watch. Your self-esteem and charisma will rise exponentially in the weeks ahead as you dive right into projects that are near and dear to your heart. That may simply mean spending more time with your kids or eating healthier foods. But if you’re interested in world domination, well, that’s possible too! You’re just going to have to push the other Cancers out of the way. Survival of the fittest, babe.

"
7375,5 june 2017,cancer,"Are your ideas your own, or is someone trying to sway you to their way of thinking? Let your intuition be your guide rather than listening to the advice of others. Problem is, deceptive Neptune is active, swirling its foggy mist. But Mars just entered Cancer yesterday, so your sense of awareness and self will increase in the weeks ahead.

"
7376,6 june 2017,cancer,"A sweet, social season lies ahead now that charismatic Venus is in your house of camaraderie. This is no time to mope at home, singles, as getting out there and networking is the best way to find new love. Even couples will enjoy partying with a group rather than spending a lot of time alone with each other. Regardless of your relationship status, the next three weeks are super for getting involved in volunteer and charitable activities.

"
7377,7 june 2017,cancer,"You’re in a “wrapping up” mode this week, thanks to Friday’s full moon arriving in your house of efficiency and getting things done. And today Mercury slides into your quiet and confidential twelfth house, an excellent aspect for creative thinking, finishing tasks and reflecting upon the next step. With your birthday season officially kicking off on the 21st it’s smart to clear your desk and your mind of clutter.

"
7378,8 june 2017,cancer,"Your sign is known for its love of the comforts of home, so it’s not surprising that decorating your nest is important to you. A happy Jupiter-Neptune aspect urges you to dig in and start creating the place of your dreams. This also applies to your outdoor environment, so head to the garden and start digging. Neptune is the planet of inspiration—let it flow!

"
7379,9 june 2017,cancer,"Are you one of those people who thinks that in order to get things done right, you have to do it yourself? Maybe not, Cancer! A sparkling full moon in your efficiency sector recommends that you loosen your grip a bit and delegate. This is a great time to review your routines to determine where you can cut back on your personal workload. This goes for home as well as the office. Would it really kill your spouse or child to push a vacuum around the house? Is it necessary to be the office mule, taking on assignment after assignment? Set some boundaries and stick to them.

"
7380,10 june 2017,cancer,"Aaahhhh. Tension lifts as sweet Jupiter resumes direct motion in your house of home and family. People may actually start cooperating with each other. An ex may finally leave you alone. Your parents find someone else’s life to butt into. The mortgage gets approved. You find a better place to live. Cleaning out the closets and getting organized somehow seems less daunting. The bottom line: more peace of mind.

"
7381,11 june 2017,cancer,"Got the urge to purge? A sudden desire to get organized and feel on top of things could hit you today. Don’t be surprised, then, if you’re emptying out junk drawers or your e-mail account. But this also applies to fitness, so get thee to the jogging trail.

"
7382,12 june 2017,cancer,"Keeping information to yourself is critical this week, so choose your confidantes wisely. It’s a smart time to do work behind the scenes too, without a lot of fanfare. An intelligent Mercury-Jupiter trine today allows you to pursue avenues that will make for a happier and more secure home life. So—look for a new place to live, talk to an assisted living place about possibly taking in your parents, consult an attorney about the back child support your ex owes you. If a new job would make you feel more at ease, start looking.

"
7383,14 june 2017,cancer,"You’re a go-getter, Cancer, and today you’ll be motivated to plow though your chores at home and the office. Just don’t find yourself in a situation in which you’re doing all of the grunt work. While you may feel better about yourself for being on task and helpful to others, the people in your world may be more than happy to take advantage of your good nature.

"
7384,15 june 2017,cancer,"It appears from your chart that your daily routine needs a lot more structure. Whether it’s your workout regimen, getting the kids off to school or finishing tasks at the office, too many loose ends and inefficient rituals are going to trip you up. If you need to let go of certain commitments, do so, and delegate to other people if you can.

"
7385,16 june 2017,cancer,"Rome wasn’t built in a day, Cancer, and now that Neptune is retrograde in your house of big thinking, you’ll have to slow your roll. But this isn’t a bad thing. A grand plan needs careful execution; otherwise, it’s just a super idea. Lots of people talk the talk but they don’t want to get their hands dirty with the grunt work. Now’s the time to focus on the details and craft a strategy.

"
7386,17 june 2017,cancer,"Just how much adventure or risk do you want to take in love, Cancer? These days finding a keeper who’s a stable partner is looking far more palatable than hooking up with an exciting but inconsistent lover. And if you’re already attached, Neptune’s recent retro turn will encourage you to dial down the drama in your union.

"
7387,18 june 2017,cancer,"You may have a rather quick change of heart when it comes to an aspiration or dream that has meant a lot to you. This doesn’t mean that you’re going to chuck it; rather, you may refine it to make it even juicier! Your birthday season is about to begin, and next Saturday the annual new moon occurs in Cancer. That’s the time to launch new endeavors.

"
7388,19 june 2017,cancer,"You may feel that you know what’s best for other people in your personal or business life, but trying telling them that. Others may be operating with their own weird “logic” that makes no sense, but what can you do? Sometimes you just have to let folks make their own mistakes so that they can learn from experience.

"
7389,20 june 2017,cancer,"Your official birthday season begins tomorrow, Cancer, and the cosmos has an early gift for you: a hush-hush meeting between Mercury and Uranus. These are the two planets of genius and strategizing, and they are holding a conversation about your career prospects. So reach out to prospective employers, research an idea for a business you could start, snoop the competition or consider entering a new field. The next four weeks are awesome for gaining momentum.

"
7390,21 june 2017,cancer,"Oh, yeah! Happy birthday to YOU, Cancer. The cosmos has a sweet surprise for you: both the Sun and chatty Mercury enter your sign today. They stroll arm-in-arm into Cancer, helping you dazzle others with your magnetism. This should be a far more social birthday season than years past thanks to the chatty messenger planet in a party mood. Book those mimosa-filled brunches now.

"
7391,22 june 2017,cancer,"Your birthday season is here and to thine own self be true. Over the next week or so you’ll start initiating new projects and ideas that mean a lot to you. However, there could be some naysayers close by, people who may put up resistance to your efforts. Put them in their places if need be.

"
7392,23 june 2017,cancer,"With so much planetary activity now occurring your sign, you would be forgiven for feeling confused about which direction to head in. People around you may have advice but the best kind of wisdom comes from within. With the Moon forming positive angles with the Sun and Mercury, you’re coming from a rational place. Trust your judgment.

"
7393,24 june 2017,cancer,"Hey there, hot stuff! Your birthday season kicks off nicely with a new moon in your sign. This is the cosmos’s annual gift to you, a lunation that enables you to pursue your heart’s desire. There’s a strong networking vibe in the air, so don’t try to go it all alone. The people you know (and the ones you haven’t met yet) will play an instrumental role in your success over the next year, so get out there and mingle.

"
7394,25 june 2017,cancer,"You’re more than ready to bust out of an old groove, thanks to hosting three planets in your sign and a recent new moon there as well. But family issues may be holding you back, or people who are stirring up dramas in an attempt to get attention. Well Cancer, you can’t put out those fires and at the same time take care of you. This is now your  time.

"
7395,26 june 2017,cancer,"Your birthday season takes flight with a soaring Mars-Neptune aspect. The watery planet is in your house of philosophy and it encourages you to change your viewpoint–about love, your talents, the kind of work you do and the kind of life you want to live. Pick up a biography about someone who dared to walk to the beat of their own drum, or watch an inspirational movie. Then crib some tactics!

"
7396,26 june 2016,cancer,"Big doings today in the cosmos as two of the most powerful heavy hitters form a magnificent angle. Jupiter and Pluto are trining each other, a superb aspect for Cancers who are climbing that ladder. Now and over the next few days is the perfect time to make contacts with people who can help your ascent. A partnership or alliance is beneficial now, and it may be something that you’d never considered before. This is Mercury’s last day in your confidentiality sector, so you won’t have to keep things quiet for long! Your intuition should be on point and will guide you along the path ahead.

"
7397,27 june 2017,cancer,"You can’t please everyone, so you have to please yourself. And that won’t be too hard this week as a bevy of planets in your sign are encouraging you to let your freak flag fly! Eventually the people around you will catch up to you and realize that you’re on the right track. Eventually.

"
7398,27 june 2016,cancer,"As Mars bolts back into direct motion, creative projects that have been on the back burner (or under review) can now move forward. It’s a great time to self-promote, as chatty little Mercury zips into your house of self-image. The messenger planet also happens to be the planet of negotiation, sharpening your wits and smoothing your words. Oh, and romance happens to be in the same house as creativity—so your love life should get a boost too!

"
7399,28 june 2017,cancer,"“Discipline” is a dirty or unpleasant word to a lot of people as it conjures up images of kale salads and long hours in a cubicle. But you won’t need discipline to make things happen; all you need is the planet Mars, the ultimate momentum machine of the solar system. Today the red planet meets up with smart little Mercury, lighting a fire under your tush to start taking action on whatever birthday goal you want to achieve.

"
7400,28 june 2016,cancer,"A business relationship needs to be realigned, and the key is communication. Your business connections are of paramount importance now and in the near future–make sure that everyone is on the same page before moving forward.

"
7401,29 june 2017,cancer,"It shouldn’t be surprising that you’re primarily focused on your own desires right now, thanks to a bevy of planets in Cancer. But as it so often happens in life, once we start to travel down a different path—and certain people begin to notice it—they try to stymie our progress. Tough guy Pluto may bring out the annoying side of these people, who could be critical or uncooperative. Ignore them and soldier on.

"
7402,29 june 2016,cancer,"An unexpected development may arise today as someone may suggest joining forces for the betterment of both of your careers. Or perhaps it’s you with the bright idea to team up with or retain an expert who will help further your ambitions! With the recent full moon in your house of work assignments, it’s not surprising. Your hard work may have caught the eye of movers and shakers.

"
7403,30 june 2017,cancer,"Who’s wearing the pants at home? It’s a recurring theme over the next week or so, Cancer. Don’t just think that a spouse or parent is getting too bossy–it could also be a kid, roommate, ex-spouse, landlord or relative (who doesn’t even live under your roof). You’ll need to create boundaries, or risk getting run over.

"
7404,30 june 2016,cancer,"Look out for #1! That phrase often has negative connotations, drumming up images of selfish, greedy selfie-taking narcissists. But in reality, there are times when you simply must put your needs before those of others, and now is one of those times. This is especially true when it comes to romance. By the way, don’t expect the SO to be happy about you needing more space–and more of a voice. Pluto in your house of commitment indicates that a partner may be (too much) in charge.

"
7405,1 july 2017,cancer,"Travel and vacation plans may require some adjustments in the weeks ahead. From your chart it appears that matters at home need to be addressed before you can charge off into the wild blue yonder. Wednesday the 5th is a super time to figure it all out.

"
7406,1 july 2016,cancer,"It’s your time to shine! Magnetic Venus is in Cancer, your house of self-image. It’s also the place that deals with kicking off important new cycles and going after your passions. With Venus forming a marvelous aspect to Jupiter, your thinking will become more nimble, your judgment more astute and your willingness to take a chance increase.

"
7407,2 july 2017,cancer,"There is no room for drama today with a partner, whether it’s a lover or a business alliance. A harsh Mars-Pluto opposition could find you on either sides of an issue and things could get heated. A full moon occurs next Saturday in your commitment sector, so try to work things out as the full moon will demand closure.

"
7408,3 july 2017,cancer,"Ready to take a chance in love? From your chart it sure looks that way. With a full moon arriving in your commitment sector this coming weekend, you’re either going to take things to a higher level with your amour, or….you just might cut bait and move upstream. If that’s the case, why not start “shopping” now?

"
7409,3 july 2016,cancer,"Start setting intentions for what you’d like to see in your life, Cancer! Tomorrow the cosmos delivers its annual birthday gift to you, a new moon in your first house. Neptune is in your corner today, adding a touch of glamour, intrigue and optimism to the proceedings. Enjoy!

"
7410,4 july 2017,cancer,"An amazing healing time begins as golden girl Venus soothes your tired mind and soul. The planet of ease and comfort has just glided into your psychological sector, the place where we hold fears, resentment, and bad habits. What this means is that changing unpleasant thought patterns can actually be easier and faster than expected. And this includes anger at an ex, or carrying a torch for someone who isn’t worth it!

"
7411,4 july 2016,cancer,"The cosmos delivers a sweet birthday gift in your lap, and it’s the annual new moon in Cancer. You can use this terrific lunation in just about any way you want. Neptune is pushing you to live more authentically and with greater creativity, but Saturn urges you to be practical and to develop a good routine.

"
7412,5 july 2017,cancer,"What happens over the next 48 hours will remind you that you’re in charge of where your life is heading. Others may think that they have a say-so, but at the end of the day it all comes down to you. Remember that over the weekend when the full moon occurs in your house of compromising!

"
7413,5 july 2016,cancer,"How high can you fly? A magnificent trine between Mercury and Neptune tells you to go for it—whatever “it” is! Your planetary aspects for growth are phenomenal. Don’t worry, with Saturn in your efficiency sector, you’ll be approaching your dreams in a practical manner.

"
7414,6 july 2017,cancer,"Just how much are you going to have to sacrifice your own needs in order to keep the peace? You may be reaching your limit with this. Unfortunately, if you don’t speak up others may think that you’re perfectly OK with the status quo. Either that, or you like being a martyr.

"
7415,6 july 2016,cancer,"Step into the spotlight, Cancer! Planetary aspects are pushing you out of the shadows and into a position of power. As Mercury glides in front of the Sun, your ability to impress others and kick off new plans is off the charts. A romantic or business partner may not be on the same page as you right away, but that will change.

"
7416,7 july 2017,cancer,"No monsters under the bed for you, Cancer! Nor in the dark recesses of your mind. A super Mercury-Venus aspect provides you with the logic to examine your fears or worries and recognize them for what they are–inconsequential.

"
7417,7 july 2016,cancer,"With the Sun, Mercury and Venus all in Cancer, you should be raring to go. There’s nothing that’s going to hold you back…or is there? A tough opposition today indicates that a partner may not be supportive of your plans. There could be anything from silence to passive-aggressive behavior to an outburst, but keep your head up. Friday gives you the opportunity to talk things over.

"
7418,8 july 2017,cancer,"A tense Mars-Pluto aspect about a week ago may have created friction in romance, and things could come to a head tonight at the Capricorn full moon. However, Saturn–planet of maturity–is in a good angle, creating a practical vibe. And amorous Neptune suggests that you stop nitpicking and take a longer view. A lot of you will tie the knot under this lunation–once you get everything ironed out, that is!

"
7419,8 july 2016,cancer,"If you have a vision, share it. A marvelous Mercury-Jupiter meet up indicates that you are in a prime position for pitching ideas, impressing people, instructing them and letting them know how you feel. This holds true for business contacts as well as personal ones. The energy keeps rolling all weekend, straight into Monday.

"
7420,9 july 2017,cancer,"Emotions could be building up inside that need to be released, but it needs to be done constructively. This could be true at home and at the office. Key clients and bosses may not be easy to deal with in July, so don’t be too thin skinned. Once Mars and the Sun move into Leo on the 20th and 22nd, your self-esteem will rise.

"
7421,9 july 2016,cancer,"Sometimes the planets warn to keep your lips zipped, other times they tell you to let it all out. Today is a perfect time to vent, share, laugh, negotiate and comment. Have no fear, there is no aggression here! Just a happy meet up between the emotional Moon and optimistic Jupiter, telling you to speak your mind.

"
7422,10 july 2017,cancer,"It’s high time that you stand up for yourself, even if the other party doesn’t like it. This could be a romantic partner, an ex or a business contact, but if anyone else in your world has their bossy pants on, smack ’em down. This energy has been building for awhile and could show up again on the 17th and 20th. All the more reason to take care of it now.

"
7423,10 july 2016,cancer,"With the fiery Sun and outgoing Mercury in your house of self-esteem and charisma, you’re the person to watch these days, Cancer! You might want to put that charm to good use today, as there are two fabulous aspects that will help you draw closer to a lover. And yes, single people, I’m talking to you too. Artistic crabs should use the energy on tap to promote their talents, as you stand a good chance of scoring a deal.

"
7424,11 july 2017,cancer,"Your family, home and personal lives need some attention, Cancer, so don’t feel guilty about blocking out time for them. This may mean that other obligations have to be put on hold for a bit, but so be it. When the Moon enters Pisces this coming weekend you can go back to socializing with your friends.

"
7425,11 july 2016,cancer,"Tiptoe around power brokers, oh crabby one, because a tense square could put you in their crosshairs. Whether it’s your biggest client, the boss, a judge, or a radar-wielding police officer, you don’t want to ruffle any feathers. Criticism may be dished out, but just take it with a stiff upper lip and move on. Mercury and Venus are scheduled to roll into your income sector this week, so take comfort that a little more green could be lining your wallet.

"
7426,12 july 2017,cancer,"Fresh ideas could pop into your head, and you would be wise to consider them. With the Moon in the most forward-thinking part of your chart, you will be willing to take a chance–to go out with that new guy, finally sit down and write the book, or plan an epic voyage around the world to parts unknown.

"
7427,12 july 2016,cancer,"Prosperity is within reach, Cancer, and the good vibes start today as profitable Venus heads into your income sector. It’s not enough to have the skills, talent and a polished resume—you also have to look the part. Venus is all about appearance, so make sure your hair is well styled, your grooming is perfect and your wardrobe is spiffy enough to impress head honchos.

"
7428,13 july 2017,cancer,"Being outspoken can sometimes be a curse, other times a blessing. And today it’s the latter! Don’t hold back, as people need to hear what you have to say. Maybe it’s, “I love you.” Maybe it’s a cutting edge idea that can turn a project (or the company) around. Perhaps it’s a blog post or a compliment with just the right inspirational words that someone will greatly appreciate.

"
7429,13 july 2016,cancer,"They say that money talks, and of all the signs of the zodiac, this applies to you! Mercury, the planet of commerce and negotiation, has entered your income sector where it will remain for several weeks. The time is ripe for reaching out to contacts, making presentations, interviewing for a new position or creating new lines of products and services. With Venus in the same part of the sky the profit potential is fabulous.

"
7430,14 july 2017,cancer,"If you have been avoiding facing up to certain issues, today’s cosmic energy brings the chance to handle them with ease–and practicality. A productive Mercury-Jupiter aspect boosts your self-esteem and provides solutions too.

"
7431,15 july 2017,cancer,"“Hell, yeah….I can do  this!”  That’s your motto o’ the day, Cancer, as the Moon glides through the most optimistic part of your chart. Don’t be surprised if you suddenly decide to head off in a brand new direction that you hadn’t considered before or were too nervous to try.

"
7432,15 july 2016,cancer,"Something will happen today that will streamline your life for years to come. Maybe it’s the decision to cut back on activities that are overloading your schedule; perhaps you cancel your gym membership (the one you never use) and get more done by working out at home. The key to rocking today’s energy is to look at your chores, routine and schedule and start snipping away at the tasks that aren’t serving you well.

"
7433,16 july 2017,cancer,"With so much recent planetary activity pushing you forward, encouraging you to step into your own power, you could be receiving flak from others–who may sense the change in you. This vibe isn’t going away anytime soon, so get used to smiling at them diplomatically–and then doing what suits you regardless.

"
7434,16 july 2016,cancer,"The Sun in Cancer is placing your needs and goals in the spotlight, and it would be wise to give them some thought before El Sol moves into Leo next Friday. A tense Uranus-Sun square could find you getting fed up with a boss or a client and ready to make some changes. Fortunately, a confident and decisive meeting between Venus and Mercury will help you brainstorm your next move. They are in your income sector, so start thinking about ways to increase your earnings.

"
7435,17 july 2017,cancer,"You don’t have enough facts to move forward with a particular plan or goal, so slow down and retrench. The harder you push the more resistance you’ll experience. Once the Sun enters Leo later this week clarity will arrive.

"
7436,17 july 2016,cancer,"Thinking about cementing a bond with someone? La Luna enters your partnership sector today, culminating in a full moon event on Tuesday. Serious relationships are what it’s all about, be they about romance or your livelihood. It’s time to get off the fence and move forward, and that applies to all Cancers. Singles have an awesome opportunity to meet a keeper over the next six months. Business people will find that they can make more progress by working as a team, rather than going solo. Consider your options.

"
7437,18 july 2017,cancer,"This is one of the most romantic days of the month thanks to amorous Venus in a superb aspect with abundant Jupiter. But in your case, it’s not about grand gestures, i.e. the big date at the expensive, buzzy restaurant. No, this is more about staying at home with a bottle of wine and really getting to know your partner.

"
7438,18 july 2016,cancer,"The nature of a partnership may be changing, Cancer, and this is a good thing. Planetary influences indicate that trying to do things the same old way just isn’t working anymore. It’s time to hit the “refresh” button on your alliance, whether it’s a personal one or business. If the refresh button doesn’t work but the system crashes, it may be time to move on.

"
7439,19 july 2017,cancer,"Getting everyone on board to achieve a task becomes easier with a productive Mercury-Saturn trine. And this will also help build your personal resolve to develop better habits and routines. The best way to go about this is to put everything in writing (Mercury insists!) so that there is no mistaking what needs to be done next.

"
7440,19 july 2016,cancer,"The last six months have been bringing relationship matters to a head, and today’s full moon in your partnership sector could find you on the verge of a major decision. Some Cancers will tie the knot, others will part ways with a lover who hasn’t fulfilled their end of the romance. The good news is that a positive Mercury-Saturn angle could bring in a new flame who’s more of a team player for you singles out there. Committed Cancers are entering a period of greater security and financial stability.

"
7441,20 july 2017,cancer,"It may be summertime north of the equator, Cancer, but it’s time to buckle down and analyze your finances instead of playing in the Sun.

"
7442,20 july 2016,cancer,"With make-things-easy Venus in your income sector, you should be actively looking for new ways to bring in cash.

"
7443,21 july 2017,cancer,"This is no time to tell someone to stick it where the sun don’t shine, no matter how badly they might deserve it! There have been some button-pushers in your life as of late, and they’re still at it today with a Sun-Uranus smackdown. Let it pass. Once the Sun enters Leo tomorrow you’ll start feeling a lot more in control.

"
7444,21 july 2016,cancer,"With the Sun entering your income sector tomorrow, you have four weeks in which you can make progress. Make haste, however. Unpredictable Uranus is scheduled to go retrograde on the 29th, making it difficult to pin down new clients, bosses and other authority figures. Today is strong for negotiating terms with business associates, things that will bring more security to your bottom line.

"
7445,22 july 2017,cancer,"Don’t be crabby because the Sun has left your sign. Yeah, the birthday party is over, but now El Sol is in your house of making mo’ money and experiencing greater self esteem. If boundaries need to be set with people around you, do so.

"
7446,22 july 2016,cancer,"Yessss! The Sun is now in Leo, your make mo’ money sector. It joins intelligent Mercury and profitable Venus, so between these three you should be able to self-promote successfully. Ask for the order or raise, close the deals, drum up new sources of income. The new moon on August 2nd opens up a six-month cycle of growth. Start planning now.

"
7447,23 july 2017,cancer,"The new moon in Leo lights a fire under you to get organized and make more money. But you’re going to have to tap dance your way around bosses, key clients, hot prospects or authority figures as unpredictable Uranus could make them hard to read. The good news is that your intuition is sharp these days, thanks to Venus, so use that to your advantage.

"
7448,23 july 2016,cancer,"Oh, the places you’ll go! Dr. Seuss knew what he was talking about, Cancer. Innovative Neptune is helping you see possibilities that you may have overlooked before in all areas of your life.

"
7449,24 july 2017,cancer,"Lots of progress can be made at the office or at home, but you’re the one who’s going to have to be at the helm. Someone close by may be playing a passive-aggressive game, pretending to be helping when they’re really not interested in being a team player. If things need to be done, you may have to do them yourself.

"
7450,24 july 2016,cancer,"Sometimes you just gotta show everyone who’s the boss, and surprise, surprise….it’s you. Take control of matters in your life that have been festering or at a standstill for way too long. When Uranus goes retrograde this coming Friday, decision makers around you may falter. It’s time for you to step up to the plate, otherwise you’ll be waiting even longer for issues to be resolved.

"
7451,25 july 2017,cancer,"Money talks, and your ability to earn more can skyrocket now that shrewd Mercury is in your communication sector. The next four weeks are superb for landing a higher paying job or building new revenue streams. But if you want to see more green, you’re going to have to self promote.

"
7452,25 july 2016,cancer,"Two heads are often better than one, but today you would be wise to listen to your own counsel. A Moon-Pluto square will pit your ideas against a partner’s, whether it’s in romance or business. Your thoughts have merit–it may be best to keep them to yourself for now. When the Moon moves into Taurus tomorrow you can start to turn them into reality.

"
7453,26 july 2017,cancer,"Nothing, and I mean nothing, is going to stop you from making progress with your financial goals. The two most energetic and motivated orbs in the solar system, Mars and the Sun, meet up in the heavens, pushing you to pull in more dinero. When Venus enters Cancer next Monday you’ll be able to charm the birds from the trees…so work it!

"
7455,27 july 2017,cancer,"Emotional issues at home or with the family can be addressed over the next 48 hours, and it looks like you’re the one who’s going to have to bring them up. It seems that people ned to understand what rules and consequences are. Start drumming this into their brains now, as the August 21st eclipse will be all about new routines.

"
7456,27 july 2016,cancer,"It pays to be frank and upfront today, literally! Ask for the order, the raise, the new job. Talk about your skills openly and with pride. People in decision making capabilities will be listening.

"
7457,28 july 2017,cancer,"Judging other people is a part of the human experience, but today’s pleasant cosmic energy tells you to let it go–and just focus on making yourself happy. The ancient Taoists believed that our body and minds are like a temple: they need to remain pure, uncluttered and serene. Go within.

"
7458,28 july 2016,cancer,"There could be a difference of opinion between you and someone close, most likely a friend or lover. The Moon in Taurus is pitting your ideas and plans against their’s, but this isn’t a deal breaker. With intelligent Mercury in your communication sector you can talk things over and come up with a solution.

"
7459,29 july 2017,cancer,"You may feel like biting someone’s head off and they may well deserve it, but the planets warn to keep your cool. Once sweet talking Venus enters your sign on Monday you’ll be able to charm your way into making matters improve.

7460,29 july 2016,cancer,"S-l-o-w  m-o. That’s the gear your career may feel like it’s in over the next few months as Uranus retrogrades in this part of your chart. Decision makers may be difficult to reach or pin down. But this period can be beneficial, as it gives you the opportunity to sit back and analyze your strategy. If you rely heavily upon technology for your line of work, it may be time for an upgrade or some classes as Uranus rules the digital world.

"
7461,30 july 2017,cancer,"Sometimes the best way to ooze charisma and sex appeal is to keep things covered up and low key. Let the trashy Real Housewives put all the “merchandise” on display! Your best bet is to keep it classy and mysterious with alluring Venus in your secluded twefth house.

"
7462,30 july 2016,cancer,"Lucky you–Mercury, that energetic little planet known for its gift of gab–has just entered your communication sector! Hustle, Cancer, because it’s going to go retrograde exactly one month from today. Polish up proposals and resumes, finish your thesis, work on ad and marketing campaigns, and get that book started. Reach out to people too, whether it’s the local mom’s network to arrange play dates for the kids or the neighborhood block association. Socialize, network and multitask.

"
7463,31 july 2017,cancer,"All eyes are on you now that magnetic Venus is in your sign! And with so much planetary activity in your houses of earning an income and meeting new people, you’re in an awesome position to boost your finances while you connect (and party!) with others.

"
7464,31 july 2016,cancer,"You’re making some big plans for the future, Cancer. Whether you’re writing a screenplay, starting an online presence, or getting ready to trek through Africa, nothing is going to hold you back. So you might want to tell that to your partner, who seems to be copping a bit of an attitude these days. This could be a spouse, SO, business alliance or even an ex. If you stand on the railroad tracks, chances are you’re gonna get run over.

"
7465,1 august 2017,cancer,"Tossing out old routines and replacing them with smoother, even healthier ones is the name of the game now that Venus is in your house of efficiency and vitality. It’s interesting that the ancients placed both of these in the same sector–they knew that feeling vibrant is a result of good habits. Besides, the better systems you have in place at work and at home, the less stressed you’ll feel.

"
7466,1 august 2016,cancer,"A powerful Sun-Saturn aspect opens your eyes to a project or idea that may be worth pursuing. Your ambition is running high, so it’s not surprising that you’re spotting opportunities all around you. With long-term Saturn involved, whatever you undertake could prove to be a winner, provided you focus first on the details.

7467,2 august 2016,cancer,"Get ready to move mountains! But don’t burn out in the process. Energetic Mars barrels into your efficiency zone today, sparking your desire to cut through delays and get things done more productively.

"
7468,3 august 2017,cancer,"Don’t count your chickens before they hatch, Cancer! Erratic Uranus retrogrades for five months in your house of big dreams and goals, creating a one-step-forward, two-steps-back kind of a vibe. That said, you can still make a lot of progress–just give things plenty of time to gel.

"
7469,3 august 2016,cancer,"Who’s the boss? A strong beam from energetic Uranus tells you to seize the reins today, as a situation needs your firm hand to guide it. You may need to set rules, protocols and boundaries for the people in your home and work circles, but so be it. The cosmos is pushing you to excel, and to achieve your ambitions. Success can’t be built on a flimsy foundation.

"
7470,4 august 2017,cancer,"I’ll be honest—trying to win a family argument or romantic dispute will be damn difficult today, Cancer! Someone may be determined to do things their way, and the problem is that you may be tempted to let them make their own choices. Chances are they’ll make the wrong ones, but try telling them that. Wait until the full moon on the 7th to put an end to the nonsense.

"
7471,4 august 2016,cancer,"Sweet talking Venus is getting ready to glide into your communications sector, enabling you to become both persuasive and eloquent. And you’re going to need her help. Some tough aspects indicate that others around you, particularly co-workers and clients, are not open to fresh new ideas and are digging in their heels. When Saturn goes direct on the 13th, things will ease up. Until then, let the honey flow from your lips–even if it kills you!

"
7472,5 august 2017,cancer,"Breaking the rules is one of those things that often sounds delicious but carries way too much risk. Luckily, you now have the opportunity to shake things up a little bit without going off the deep end. Take that chance!

"
7473,5 august 2016,cancer,"Stern Saturn has been retrograde for months in your work sector, which may have brought about issues with slacking co-workers, unreliable employees or flaky clients. Red tape may have been thick and you’ve been banging your head against a wall dealing with inefficient protocols. But Venus comes to your rescue today, entering your communications sector. So while the slackers and red tape may still be there, your ability to work around it soars.

"
7474,6 august 2017,cancer,"Who’s the boss at your residence, or within your family unit? Today’s the kind of day when you may realize that trying to play nice and be a “team member” just ain’t working. So if you need to take a stand and put people in their places—so be it!

"
7475,6 august 2016,cancer,"Standoff! Mars and Venus are a tad annoyed with each other today, courtesy of a square between them. Squares indicate that something needs to be worked out, and the matter at hand is: who’s in charge? Yup, aggressive Mars has its bossy pants on while Venus is trying to make nice. This energy could crop up anywhere–at the office, in a romantic relationship or a in a family dynamic. There’s no honor in being a doormat, no glory in being a tyrant.

"
7476,7 august 2017,cancer,"Ready to see more cash in your bank account? Yeah, I thought so. Lucky for you, tonight’s lunar eclipse in Aquarius can help you wrap up financial negotiations, a real estate deal, windfall, inheritance or court award. And if you’re not involved in any of these matters, you’re still in a good spot as this is the house of making smart investment decisions and developing new passive income streams.

"
7477,7 august 2016,cancer,"KISS. Keep it simple, sweetheart. That’s the motto for today as an opposition between chatty Mercury and confusing Neptune takes place in the heavens. You certainly have the gift of gab these days, thanks to some positive planetary action in your communications sector, but others might not get what you’re saying. By the end of the week things should turn around. But pay attention to those people around you who do  get it and are pretending that they don’t.

"
7478,8 august 2016,cancer,"You can’t embark on a journey unless you’re willing to set sail and leave the shore. Watery Neptune is encouraging you to chart a course and let the wind carry you into a new future, but practical considerations and fears may be getting in the way. Chiron, the wounded healer, is active today, helping you get to the root of your concerns.

"
7479,9 august 2017,cancer,"Money matters require a firm hand these days, and you may find that getting advice from a savvy professional is the best way to go. You may need to make adjustments but the good news is that the cosmos definitely has your back when it comes to accruing wealth.

"
7480,9 august 2016,cancer,"Educate yourself about all the aspects of a decision you’re in the process of making, or a plan that you’re considering. Thanks to intelligent Mercury’s position in your third house of research, you should be able to uncover aspects that perhaps weren’t apparent before. A sweet Moon-Venus aspect also helps, as it provides creative solutions that you can act on right away.

"
7481,10 august 2017,cancer,"Sweet day for sweet talk! Flirt, whisper, laugh, flatter, chat up a new flame, and make plans with your current amour. But despite the frisky vibe, some stability can be reached within a relationship–a nice bonus indeed.

"
7482,10 august 2016,cancer,"How you relate to other people is the focus of the planets this week, and a powerful trine today will open your eyes. Doing things the same old way just isn’t cutting it anymore. So if you’ve been killing people with kindness, only to get nowhere, it may be time for some tough love. Likewise, if you’ve been coming on strong, switch to a more mellow approach, or even drop the subject altogether–at least until the other person gets it.

"
7483,11 august 2017,cancer,"As Scooby Doo is famous for saying….”Ruh roh!” Yup, Mercury goes retrograde–and it does so in your communication sector. Between now and August 31st Cancers, of all the 12 signs of the zodiac, need to be careful about what they say and put in writing. One of the issues at hand is that you’ve got great ideas, but others either can’t appreciate them or are trying to oppose them. Your best bet is to keep them to yourself, at least for now,

"
7484,11 august 2016,cancer,"You’re ready to get down to business and get some work done, whether that means putting together a business plan or weeding the garden. The problem is that the people in your orbit, from family members to friends to co-workers, seem to be getting in the way of you doing the job! However, going into tyrant mode is not going to work. With sweet Venus and benevolent Jupiter in your communications sector, you’ll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

"
7485,12 august 2017,cancer,"The more forgiving and relaxed you are, the more you’ll draw people in to your circle–and your way of thinking. This is especially true in the romance department, where a sultry Venus-Neptune aspect helps bring some peace along with some juicy, amorous excitement your way!

Just don’t be so ambitious that you try to force longer-term plans or projects into existence before the time is right. Slow down and make sure that you’ve got all your ducks in a row first.

"
7488,13 august 2016,cancer,"Finally–forward progress! Your daily routines both at home and at work have been under the strict scrutiny of retrograde Saturn. Over the past five months you may have tried new hacks and routines that were designed to lighten your workload and become more efficient. Delays may arisen with slacking colleagues or employees, computer systems that were out of date, or clients who kept making demands. Now that Saturn is direct, your routines should run more smoothly–and less stressfully.

"
7489,14 august 2017,cancer,"Friends and colleagues are your lucky charm today, so work those connections! A pal could introduce you to a new lover, tip you off about a business idea or serve as a good sounding board. This is also a smart time to seek the advice of a mentor or expert if you feel that you need it.

"
7490,14 august 2016,cancer,"Saturn went direct yesterday in your extremely efficient sixth house, firing you up to get stuff done. But don’t tackle too much too soon. Neptune and Venus are at odds today, indicating that long term plans and projects need a heck of a lot more thought before you charge ahead. With intelligent Mercury in your house of thinking you’ll be able to sort things out.

"
7491,15 august 2017,cancer,"Honey, it’s time to take good care of yourself  rather than tending to everyone else’s needs. A Venus-Pluto opposition warns that you’re putting too much energy into helping others, to the point where you won’t have any energy left for yourself. Stop being Mother Teresa.

"
7492,15 august 2016,cancer,"With the mighty Sun forming a fabulous angle with Uranus, you can hit upon some business ideas that will set you apart from the rest. The potential for making more money is excellent, but in order to profit from your brainstorms, you may need to seek the help of a mentor who can guide you down the right path. An alliance with another person may be the best way to go.

"
7493,16 august 2017,cancer,"Getting down to brass tacks with your income is what it’s all about, not chasing down high falutin’ dreams that have little chance of paying off.

"
7495,17 august 2017,cancer,"Your self-esteem may take a hit today due to a tense Venus-Jupiter square, but it doesn’t seem that the source of your discomfort is on the outside.

"
7496,17 august 2016,cancer,"With Venus in your chatty house of communication, you can sell ice cream to Eskimos.

Both in romance and business, you’ll be able to cajole, charm and win over the hearts and minds of people who count.

"
7497,18 august 2017,cancer,"With the Moon passing through your sign before it enters Leo for Monday’s eclipse, you should be thinking about the goals you have for the future. New possibilities are beckoning but for some reason you seem to be resisting them.

"
7498,18 august 2016,cancer,"You may be wrapping up an important financial deal, such as buying a house, settling a lawsuit or entering into a business deal. The full moon in your finance sector is pulling all of the pieces together. However, due diligence is needed when signing papers as Jupiter opposes Chiron.

You could be buying or selling a house, trying to close a client or are considering a job offer. Don’t make a decision today, or sign on the dotted line however.

7502,22 august 2016,cancer,"With the Moon swinging past Uranus, the planet of inner genius in your career sector, you may stumble upon brilliant ideas that will enable you to fulfill your ambitions. The best part? The Sun enters Virgo today, your third house of thinking, communicating and negotiating. Get to work on your plans right away for maximum results.

"
7503,23 august 2016,cancer,"Something that may have appeared to be a fantasy or pipe dream may actually be doable, Cancer. The key is to adjust your expectations a bit. With Mars and Saturn side by side in your house of getting things done, you won’t be short on ambition or discipline, that’s for sure. Just spend a little time considering how you can make this thing work.

"
7504,24 august 2016,cancer,"A friend or mentor may put in some good words for you, or help you out with a project you’re working on. Your diligence and ambition in recent weeks are admirable, but they may exact a price! Too much work and not enough play can make Cancer one tired soul. Plan some downtime for yourself this weekend–you deserve it.

"
7505,25 august 2016,cancer,"Paranoid much? The Moon in your mysterious house of psychological depth could be making you worry about health or business issues. Problem is, murky Neptune is in a funky angle, which indicates that your intuition could be off today. So before you conjure up images of being rushed to the hospital or getting fired from your job, count to ten. Then call a a pal and make plans for cocktails at 5, at which time you can laugh this off.

"
7506,26 august 2016,cancer,"Measure twice, cut once. That old carpentry saying is wise advice for you as the cosmos urges you to slow down–before you make a mistake. Mars is in your efficiency zone, riling you up to get things done, which is admirable. Whether it’s losing weight or trying to wrap up a work project, you want results. Problem is you’re too busy focusing on the big picture to pay attention to the details.

"
7507,27 august 2016,cancer,"Say it loud and proud! An audacious meetup between Venus and Jupiter in the heavens paves the way for you to speak and be heard. These two orbs, the most generous in our solar system, hook up in your third house of communication. Write that book or screenplay, become a teacher, negotiate the mother of all business deals, or unleash a social media campaign that will go viral. Your words and ideas have power–don’t hold back.

"
7508,28 august 2016,cancer,"The weekend has your name written all over it, Cancer. With the Moon in your sign it’s time to treat yourself to some downtime. Friends could call you to make plans, including someone who may have fallen off your radar awhile back. If there has been any tension between you and a pal this is a wonderful day to mend your relationship.

"
7509,29 august 2016,cancer,"With Venus spending a few last moments in your house of thinking, writing and communicating, you may be tempted to wrap up a contract, proposal or some kind of negotiation. If everything is solid, do so. But if not, try to hold off as Mercury retrogrades in this part of your chart tomorrow. That’s OK–this gives you a chance to review every facet and polish things up.

"
7510,30 august 2016,cancer,"You’re an idea factory these days, Cancer! The sector that governs expression and intelligence is fired up with powerful planets, and an eclipse is scheduled to occur here on Thursday. But make sure that everything you put out there is up to snuff as Mercury goes backwards in the heavens until September 22nd. Clients, friends and neighbors from the past could call you with socializing and working together in mind. These connections could pay off nicely in the future, so don’t brush them off.

"
7511,31 august 2016,cancer,"Show me the money! With the Moon linking to rebellious Uranus, you’re anxious to see more money coming in the door–literally. From your chart it looks like you need it for family and home-related expenses. But with Mercury now retro you have to be clear with others and confirm all financial transactions and details. There could be delays, but with Mars and Saturn in such a strong position from your work area, new assignments or gigs could be coming your way.

"
7512,1 september 2016,cancer,"Word up! A solar eclipse in your chatty third house of expression makes you the person to listen to. The next six months are auspicious for self-promotion, whether it’s via social media, blogging, writing a book or hitting the lecture circuit. Anyone in the arts benefits from this powerful energy as your ability to showcase your work is magnified, not to mention increasing your skill set. But all Cancers will be able to speak their mind with clarity and conviction, whether it’s with family members, a lover or the boss.

"
7513,2 september 2016,cancer,"With Mercury backstroking through your house of expression, this is an excellent time to polish up presentations, manuscripts, websites, blogs, your art portfolio, contracts and proposals. Today Mercury forms a fabulous aspect with lucky Jupiter, indicating that anything you work on will enjoy success, and profits to boot. If you’ve been considering getting a teaching gig, returning to school or public speaking, look into your options now.

"
7514,3 september 2016,cancer,"It’s a good day for making progress with the people closest to you, but communication is the key. Don’t expect everyone to read your mind and magically assess what you want and need. That being said, if you reach out to others, you can enjoy more contentment and security in the weeks ahead.

"
7515,4 september 2016,cancer,"Power struggles could erupt at home as a number of celestial orbs are at odds with each other today over everything from vacations, to which sibling helps out the most, to child care. A tough Sun-Neptune opposition in the heavens will make it hard to separate fact from fantasy. When optimistic Jupiter enters your fourth house of domestic matters this Friday, however, things will begin to get smoothed out.

"
7516,5 september 2016,cancer,"In the movies, the strong silent type (think Clint Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone) is always a hero among men as well as women. And there are some women out there too who say little but pack a powerful punch (think Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games).  With the mighty Sun moving ever closer to dominant, dynamic Pluto, you’re coming into your own strength. Words have great power: use them wisely and strategically.

"
7517,6 september 2016,cancer,"Keep your wits about you if you’re in the process of negotiating anything, whether it’s a legal contract or just trying to get your lover to spend more time with you. A tough Sun-Neptune opposition could cloud your vision. Don’t give in to flattery, guilt trips or excuses–nor should you dish them out yourself!

"
7518,7 september 2016,cancer,"Remember this from your report card? “Works well with others.” That’s the motto o’ the day as four positive planets encourage you to cooperate, for the good of the group as well as for your own personal gain. Dividing up the tasks that people need to take care of is part of this effort, so make sure that you’re not over or under delegating. The cosmos wants you to have more peace of mind and comfort, something that will become clearer after Jupiter glides into Libra on Friday.

"
7519,8 september 2016,cancer,"Taking care of business is what it’s all about today, and that means getting caught up with your chores at home and at the office. The Moon and Mars are going to fire you up to get moving, and with structured Saturn nearby, you’ll develop smart habits that will stick. Neptune is a bit peeved from your house of travel, annoyed that practical matters are taking precedence over having fun, but you’ll be able to kick back and relax in the not too distant future.

"
7520,9 september 2016,cancer,"A tender year lies ahead now that gracious Jupiter has entered your house of family and home. This is your best year ever for finding a new home or decorating your current abode. Any problems with landlords or mortgage companies should be alleviated, as Jupiter’s goal is for you to feel content and secure. This also includes settling family squabbles, especially with people above you on the family tree. You love to nest—this placement will help you create a home that’s a castle!

"
7521,10 september 2016,cancer,"The daily grind may be pushing you to the point where you fantasize about the future, not a smart move under today’s planetary influences. Get-real Saturn is squaring Lala Land Neptune, invoking thoughts of running away from it all. Like: quitting the job and moving to an island so that you can open up a pina colada stand on the beach. Telling someone to take a hike. Ditching the grocery shopping so that you can binge watch some Netflix. Sorry, Cancer! Duty calls and daydreams need to be backed up with a serious plan.

"
7522,11 september 2016,cancer,"Your emotions about a family or romantic matter may be all over the map today as Venus squares Pluto. The best way to handle it is to let the feelings flow, then get real. This is no time for holding things in, but nor is it the right time to play mind games–with yourself or others.

"
7523,12 september 2016,cancer,"Don’t assume that everything is cast in stone this week, Cancer. A series of squares advises that you focus on the details of projects or relationships you’re working on. They may need adjusting, something that will become more apparent with Friday’s lunar eclipse in Pisces. But this is a beneficial aspect as the eclipse’s energy will move your plans along, perhaps even much faster than anticipated.

"
7524,13 september 2016,cancer,"There seems to be a disconnect between you and some of the people around you. If you feel like you’re talking and they’re not listening–or they’re not getting it–you can blame it on a Sun-Mars square. But that’s OK. A glorious lunar eclipse this Friday will help take your message to a much higher level. You’re going to be given a brand new platform on which to present your ideas, and to people who are actually interested.

"
7525,14 september 2016,cancer,"A happy meeting of several celestial orbs bodes well for making progress at the office. Don’t be afraid to express your deepest thoughts to people in positions of power, as they will be impressed. If bosses or key clients have underestimated you in the past, they’re in for a big surprise!

"
7526,15 september 2016,cancer,"An unexpected opportunity might be coming your way to advance your career. Spontaneous Uranus in your house of ambition forms terrific angles with Mars, the Moon and Neptune. This is all about expansion and getting away from the same old grind. Stepping on to a more public stage is also a possibility: publishing a book, landing media interviews or becoming a public speaker. Tomorrow’s eclipse can make things happen quickly!

"
7527,16 september 2016,cancer,"If you’ve been looking for a platform on which to broadcast your talents or ideas, you’re in luck! Today’s lunar eclipse in Pisces is the ticket for more exposure, whether it’s getting published, scoring media interviews, teaching or hitting the lecture circuit. With energetic Mars in your house of work assignments, you could land some new projects, but make sure to wrap up things you were already working on before you move on to conquering the world.

"
7528,17 september 2016,cancer,"It may be the weekend but the planets are talking about you experiencing amazing success in your career! A fortuitous trine between Uranus and Mars is custom made to showcase your talents. Better yet is that Uranus will stimulate your brain to come up with cutting edge ideas that will dazzle others. Keep a notepad handy to jot down your brainstorms.

"
7529,18 september 2016,cancer,"It can’t be all work all the time, Cancer. You need to take a break from your your responsibilities and spend some time at home. Whether you’re single or are raising a family, quality time is needed. This may hit you rather quickly today as the Moon swings past erratic Uranus. They’re trying to send you a message to slow down and savor life more.

"
7530,19 september 2016,cancer,"It’s time to stand up for yourself, Cancer. By nature you’re a creature who craves comfort, and currently you may be taking the position that it’s best to not rock the boat with people who are challenging you. The problem is that if you don’t face them now, you could be nothing but roadkill in a few months. On Thursday Mercury goes direct in your communications sector, so get ready to set some boundaries.

"
7531,22 september 2016,cancer,"If you’re interested in making progress with a domestic matter, such as finding a new place to live, starting a family or taking care of your parents, the next four weeks are the best time in many years to do so. That’s because the mighty Sun enters Libra today, your fourth house of domestic bliss and contentment. Lucky Jupiter just went there on the 9th, so don’t waste this important and helpful energy.

"
7532,23 september 2016,cancer,"This could be an emotional day as the Moon in your sign forms a difficult angle with optimistic Jupiter. One part of you may be looking at the sunny side of the street while the other side focuses on the dark alleys! This too shall pass. Monday is a banner day when things improve.

"
7533,24 september 2016,cancer,"If the balance of responsibilities or power is off in a business or romantic partnership, today is perfect for discussing it. A pleasant Mercury-Pluto trine will enable you to clear the air. Avoid the tendency, though, to make it all about you.

"
7534,25 september 2016,cancer,"All work and no play is going to make a crab dull and boring! You need to lighten up your workload, whether it’s chores at home or the pile on your desk at the office. Venus is now in your fifth house of fun and relaxation, but with the Moon in your more serious house of duty and obligations, you may feel like you need to cross items off your to-do list. Please.

"
7535,26 september 2016,cancer,"Your overall feelings of security and contentment should increase dramatically over the next few months, thanks to a series of planetary aspects that are designed to help you feel more rooted. A sparkling Jupiter-Sun conjunction today sets the stage for changes to come especially in the area of home and loved ones: moving, buying a place, selling, redecorating, working out family issues and even starting a family of your own. A positive Moon-Saturn link indicates that more money will be coming in too in the form of a higher income.

"
7536,27 september 2016,cancer," 
Ready to join forces with another? Energetic Mars enters your house of partnering for the first time in two years. This is serious stuff, so be discerning about whom you connect with: a new lover, a future spouse, a business partner or an expert (such as a booking agent or attorney) who will represent your interests. Pluto has been asking you since April to analyze any flaws or weaknesses in an existing relationship. Now it’s time to either fix them or part ways.

"
7537,28 september 2016,cancer,"Excellent day to discuss things with a partner as the passionate Moon and intelligent Mercury trine Pluto. You need to get your relationship on a more even keel so that you’re sharing the balance of power. Focus on the issues that are in front of you right now, today, rather than discussing the long-term future. One step at a time.

"
7538,29 september 2016,cancer,"Keep your ear to the ground, Cancer! A scoop could come your way about something important to you, an ambition or goal that is near to your heart. It’s possible that someone in a decision making capacity will be making decisions that will positively affect you. Sit tight.

"
7539,30 september 2016,cancer,"Home and family matters get a boost today with an auspicious meeting of the Moon and Jupiter. Considering that the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, are forming a fabulous trine tomorrow, you could be considering a pregnancy, moving in with someone or (a drumroll please) meeting the parents. This is a good weekend also to shop for items to make your home more comfy and chic.

"
7540,1 october 2016,cancer,"Ready to feather the nest? Move to a posher pad? Start a family or move in with someone special? If that’s the case today’s new moon has your name written all over it. Over the next six months you can make headway in these areas, in addition to saving up the down payment for a place, helping out your parents or settling family disputes. Romance is also in the air thanks to a sexy Venus-Neptune trine, encouraging you to be a bit more adventurous. Date someone who’s not your usual type, or plan a night out at a venue that you may not have considered before.

"
7541,2 october 2016,cancer,"With yesterday’s new moon in your domestic sector, you’re entering a period in which your home life can and should be more peaceful and relaxing. A happy meeting between Pluto and Venus on Tuesday should have you thinking about where romantic love fits into this picture. Relationships with children should improve too as the Moon focuses on them today.

"
7542,3 october 2016,cancer,"You’re going to need perspective this week as some tough angles may make you take everything way too personally. Today and tomorrow, however, are good days for talking things over with people close to you. Try to clear the air now so that your nerves and emotions aren’t jangled by the weekend.

"
7543,4 october 2016,cancer,"Psychologists say that 90% of our daily actions and behavior are governed by habits and if that’s true, then we need to make sure that ours are excellent! And that’s what the cosmos is demanding of Cancers today with a potent Sun-Saturn sextile. A lot of our daily actions were shaped back when we were kids, and now is the time to examine what thought patterns and beliefs from our past might be holding us back. The good news is that Saturn is the planet of discipline so if you resolve to make changes, they should stick.

"
7544,5 october 2016,cancer,"A productive Venus-Pluto aspect works wonders when it comes to discussing deeply personal matters with someone close. Pluto is the planet that plumbs the depths of our psyches, so getting down to the nitty gritty is a possibility today. Fortunately gentle Venus will allow this to take place without a lot of drama–and with plenty of healing.

"
7545,7 october 2016,cancer,"Moody much? The Sun and Jupiter, two of the most beneficial orbs in our solar system, are both in your emo fourth house, with Mercury joining them today. The issue at hand is that over the next ten days they’ll be forming tight angles to other planets, possibly shaking your confidence and making you want to lash out, especially against a boss or lover. With manipulative Pluto in your partnership sector, it is entirely possible that a business or romantic partner may be trying to gain control of your relationship in ways that you don’t care for. But crying, raging, retreating, or sulking won’t help matters either. The full moon on the 16th helps put you in the driver’s seat.

"
7546,8 october 2016,cancer,"Things could get emotional in a partnership, be it business or romantic, possibly resulting in a power struggle. The passionate Moon connects with both aggressive Mars and metamorphic Pluto in your house of alliances. Who’s in charge? Which of you is doing all of the grunt work while the other slacks? Hopefully you’re not in this situation but if you are, it’s time for a wakeup call.

"
7547,9 october 2016,cancer,"Your opinion about what you need from love may be changing, courtesy of hosting transformative Pluto and fast moving Mars in your partnership sector. And with the Moon connecting with Pluto today, this process might be accelerating. Business alliances could also be affected, as you suddenly realize that changes need to be made–now.

"
7548,10 october 2016,cancer,"If you’re looking to secure financing for a home or a home-related purchase, you’re in luck. This week planets in your domestic sector are forming good aspects, and today the inspirational Moon is in your finance house. Brainstorm ways you can earn more, save more and reduce your debt. A family member might help you with down payment money, but relying on your own smarts is a also a good way to go.

"
7549,11 october 2016,cancer,"Truth be told, your weekly forecast holds some difficult aspects when it comes to home and family related matters, which covers a lot of ground: your kids (which includes custody arrangements), repairs (and the expense involved), and dealing with landlords, room mates and parents. But today is stellar for making things work, so by all means try to put dramas to rest as best you can.

"
7550,12 october 2016,cancer,"Your need for security may not be the same as someone else’s, something you would be wise to remember in the week ahead. Whether it’s emotional, financial or job security, it usually takes two or more people to create. And they may not be as interested or committed as you are. That’s OK—the full moon next Sunday in your house of authority will help you get a handle on things.

"
7551,13 october 2016,cancer,"Patience is definitely going to be needed today as a Mercury-Mars square could frustrate the living daylights out of you. Domineering Mars is in your house of partnerships, and today you may have just one nerve left—and your spouse, ex or a family member is working it. Watch what you say, as words can’t be taken back. You’ll need to remain calm through the weekend as this energy isn’t going away soon.

"
7552,14 october 2016,cancer,"You know that great feeling you have when you’re caught up–with errands, the house cleaning, that pile of papers on your desk? Make the smart decision today to develop new habits that will keep you on top of everything. Saturn, the great disciplinarian, will help new protocols stick.

"
7553,15 october 2016,cancer,"Try to keep a low profile in the days ahead, especially when it comes to dealing with people in authority. One of them could lash out with unexpected criticism, or try to gain control over a relationship or situation. Under current planetary influences, you may not be in the mood for rocking the boat. However, that doesn’t mean that you should let others steamroll right over you. Tomorrow’s full moon in Aries is perfect for gaining more authority of your own.

"
7554,16 october 2016,cancer,"Finally! Tonight’s full moon in your ambitious tenth house can bring some much needed acclaim and progress your way. You’ve worked hard over the past six months, Cancer—now it’s payback time, in a good way. In the weeks and months ahead you will see the fruits of your labors. If that means changing jobs or careers, or starting your own company, so be it. Any ambition of yours is highlighted, not just work-related ones. But the Sun is in a tough angle to Uranus, indicating that home and family related matters still need to be resolved.

"
7555,17 october 2016,cancer,"Super day to team up with mentors, new clients, business partners, pals, or your amour! A friendly Moon-Pluto aspect can also bring in new faces, people who can be part of your circle for a long time to come. Reach out to others and make an effort to expand your social network. With the Sun entering your work sector later this week, you’ll be glad you did.

"
7556,18 october 2016,cancer,"Hey there, you sexy thang! Venus glides into your house of wellness and vitality today which of course includes your fit physique. Wait, you’re sporting a muffin top or a beer gut? Then get moving, Skippy–literally. Get thee to the gym or the jogging path in the park and start toning up. You never know whom you might meet while sweating yourself into a dynamic new bod.

"
7557,19 october 2016,cancer,"You are in one heck of a sweet spot, Cancer! The recent full moon fell in your house of ambition, encouraging you to kick off or complete plans of great importance to you. And today a rare conjunction occurs between Mars and Pluto in your partnership zone, which could open doors to meeting new people. Whether it’s a new lover with serious long term potential or a person who’d like to join forces with you in a business setting, your ability to make the right connections is growing. Some of these folks could be major league decision makers too, a big benefit.

"
7558,20 october 2016,cancer,"Watch your words today as you may be prompted to come off a bit too strong with someone. Likewise, you could be at the receiving end of some criticism, and it may throw you off guard. Someone in a position of authority (or a wannabe) could be copping an attitude. Don’t read too much into it and imagine the worst. When the Sun rolls into Scorpio later in the week, your mind will turn to more pleasurable things—like romance and having fun.

"
7559,21 october 2016,cancer,"Take it easy there, crabby. With the emotional Moon in your house of self opposing Mars and Pluto, you could be tempted to take a nip at someone with those razor sharp pincers of yours. You may be chafing under the strain of the demands of a lover, business partner, ex-spouse or a client. This will pass within a day or so; chill. Better yet is that the Sun enters your fifth house of frisky fun and romance this Saturday. Start making plans.

"
7560,22 october 2016,cancer,"Phew. After months of hard work it’s time to take a breather. El Sol has just entered Scorpio, your house of frisky fun, romance and creativity. Over the next four weeks the cosmos asks you—no, it demands!— that you chill out and have some fun. Spend more quality time with your lover and the kids. Take up a new hobby or vow to set aside time every week to immerse yourself in an activity that brings you joy and relaxation. Singles, this is a super time to meet someone new, so get out there and circulate.

"
7561,23 october 2016,cancer,"Should you hold back in the safety zone, or take a risk? That may be the question today as optimistic Jupiter meets up with confusing Neptune. With the Sun now in the most creative part of your chart, chances are you’ve been considering living a more interesting life style. Fears and considerations might be holding you back. Perhaps you think you’ll look foolish or you don’t have what it takes. Wrong! When Mercury joins the Sun tomorrow, you’ll be ready to step out of the shadows.

"
7562,24 october 2016,cancer,"Saying what’s on your mind gets a heck of a lot easier with Mercury changing signs today, especially if you need to communicate with a lover or a child. Singles, now’s the time to broadcast your availability and to put yourself in places where you could meet someone new. This placement is also excellent for creative types or those who need to think in innovative ways to get their job done. Thursday rocks for getting your ideas across and showcasing yourself.

"
7563,25 october 2016,cancer,"While you’re clear on the direction a project should be taking, other people around you may be throwing monkey wrenches into the works. Stalling, being too opinionated, deliberately trying to undermine a group effort—all of this could be on the table today. Keep calm and carry on. Tomorrow is a better day for getting back on track.

"
7564,26 october 2016,cancer,"Happiness at home is not far away with a series of happy angles over the next few days. Whether you’re single or attached, you should be focused on turning your home into a castle. “Just dating” folks could talk about moving in together, babies could be on the way, problems with roommates or family members can be resolved and chores can be assigned fairly to the people under your roof.

"
7565,27 october 2016,cancer,"When chatty Mercury meets up with the Sun (as it does today), it’s time to hold a conversation and demonstrate your ideas. In your case, Cancer, they meet in your house of romance, fun and children. So: ask someone out. Talk to your boyfriend or girlfriend about where you’re headed. Plan a terrific weekend event, such as a party or going to a concert. Consider whether it’s time to start a family or not. And since this also the house of creativity, it’s a fabulous day for inspiration, showcasing your ideas, or signing up for a class or webinar that will take your talents to a higher level.

"
7566,28 october 2016,cancer,"You’re not destined to always be slogging away at the office, Cancer! It may feel that way with aggressive Mars charging forcefully through your house of work, but today the red planet forms a sweet angle with Chiron. The message? Slow down and smell the roses. Believe it or not, you can probably get more work done in less time if you would spend more time recharging your batteries and relaxing a little.

"
7567,29 october 2016,cancer,"The two most combustible planets, Mars and Uranus, are at loggerheads today, creating a tempestuous mood. You or someone close may not want to stick to tried and true methods. A difference in opinion could lead to feeling defensive. Someone may try to pull rank in a romantic or business partnership, pushing the other person around. Just know that a new moon in Scorpio tomorrow bodes well for ironing out your differences and enjoying life a heck of a lot more!

"
7568,30 october 2016,cancer,"Time to let your talent shine! A new moon in the most expressive and creative part of your chart is custom made for showing off your skills. Over the next few months, do what it takes to develop them further. This holds true whether you’re an accountant, stay-at-home mom or a musician. Sign up for classes, read a book, attend a seminar or find a mentor. Inspirational Neptune is close by, promising that if you put in the effort that you’ll see results.

"
7569,31 october 2016,cancer,"Recent planetary activity has been stirring up ideas and possibilities in your brain, and you may be keen to start working on them. But don’t push too hard or too fast. You need the approval, cooperation and good opinions of other people for some of these activities, who may not be as motivated as you are to get things done.

"
7570,1 november 2016,cancer,"Confusion about the future of a long term plan clears up, especially in the area of romance. While it may have felt in the recent past that progress has been slow, a Sun-Neptune trine sheds light on what needs to be done next. This is also true for matters involving children—custody arrangements, their education, discipline—and whether or not you should conceive! Your skills and talents are well aspected too. It’s time to take your mojo to a much bigger stage.

"
7571,2 november 2016,cancer,"The word o’ the day is: chill. Schedule some down time for yourself, whether you go solo or spend it with a lover or the kids. No one gets to the end of their life and says that they wished they had spent more time at the office. You may need to be the one in a romantic partnership who has to schedule the date nights or the quality time with the little ones, but it’s worth every minute.

"
7572,3 november 2016,cancer,"Turn off the TV. Put the smart phone away. Shut down the computer. Instead, have a face to face talk with the people you love: kids, family, or a lover. When I was growing up my father never let us use the phone or watch television while we ate, as that was considered to be valuable sharing time. And that’s what the planets want you to do today: have meaningful conversations with your loved ones.

"
7573,4 november 2016,cancer,"If you’ve been feeling that you have little or no say-so in a key relationship, your emotions could start to bubble up today. Erratic Uranus is active in your house of authority, so you may feel unsure about how to go about being heard. Try to talk things over on Monday, a positive day for discussion. But don’t wait, because once aggressive Mars enters Aquarius next week, you might erupt like a volcano.

You will have the opportunity to dazzle a boss, client or prospective employer with your money-making  (or saving) ideas, not to mention your talents. The 14th brings a full moon in your house of teamwork, so don’t be surprised if you are selected for a special role in a group project.

"
7575,6 november 2016,cancer,"A sudden burst of energy may inspire you to get fit and live a healthier lifestyle, Cancer! With inspirational Uranus in your take-charge sector, you may quickly toss the Cheetos and chips from the kitchen cabinet and replace them with fruits and vegetables. Lace up the sneakers and head out for a run or power walk, then schedule time for physical activity in the week ahead. Considering that disciplinarian Saturn is currently in your house of habit-building, you can’t go wrong.

"
7576,7 november 2016,cancer,"Do you go with your gut, and your own opinion, or do you do things the way someone else wants you to do them? That’s the dilemma today with a Moon-Sun square, but fortunately it’s short lived. You’re becoming more decisive, not only in your own personal affairs but those that involve others. There’s nothing wrong with taking charge of a situation. As a matter of fact, the cosmos recommends it.

"
7577,8 november 2016,cancer,"You have a secret weapon at the office, Cancer—it’s your creativity. Innovative Uranus in your house of talent is stirring up your brain to come up with bright ideas, new protocols and financial strategies. Don’t be afraid to act on them, as it appears from your chart that you will benefit over the long run with more money in your pocket.

"
7578,9 november 2016,cancer,"Hold on to the plastic in your wallet—as well as your tongue! Aggressive Mars just entered your house of finances and emotions. You could burn through cash and run up your credit cards under this aspect, so be careful when it comes to holiday spending. Likewise, keep a rational mind set. Don’t let jealousy, resentment and anger take over your mind quickly. That being said, you can make great progress when it comes to saving money and feeling more secure emotionally if you choose to focus on the right things.

"
7579,10 november 2016,cancer,"Jimmy Buffett sings that changes in latitudes will bring changes in attitude and truer words were never spoken! A Moon-Neptune conjunction could put you in the mood for white sandy beaches and pina coladas, not to mention romance. So start trawling the travel sites and make some fun plans. Singles, new love could be found while on holiday, so pack your bags and go.

"
7580,11 november 2016,cancer,"What a combo! Mars just entered your house of steamy sex two days ago and today his cosmic lover, Venus, glides into your house of commitment. Things should really start heating up in the next five weeks as the cosmos wants you to enjoy the company of a lusty keeper, not a seductive loser. Racy, provocative commitment-phobes and already married people are not the way to go right now.

"
7581,12 november 2016,cancer,"You know the saying: if you want to get things done, ask a busy person to do it. The idea, of course, is that busy people have figured out how to efficiently handle what’s in front of them. But now’s not the time to be that busy person who gets dumped on! Yes, Mercury just went into your productivity sector, but the planets suggest that you let others pick up some of the slack. Otherwise you’ll be fried by the new moon on the 29th.

"
7582,13 november 2016,cancer,"Getting along well with other people should become a lot easier in the weeks ahead. No, they’re not going to change, but your attitude will. You should find that it’s much easier to deal with the moods and quirks of the folks around you thanks to easy going Venus now in your house of relating.

"
7583,15 november 2016,cancer,"An exciting new project could come your way, something with some serious profit potential. With Mercury in your house of efficiency you have what it takes to blast through it with ease. But co-workers or team members may not be as quick to get on board. Slacking and disagreements could arise, which will test your patience. When Neptune goes direct this weekend some of the confusion may dissipate and momentum can build.

"
7584,16 november 2016,cancer,"What’s the best way to proceed with a romantic dilemma? It could be something small, such as telling your boyfriend that he needs to put the toilet seat back in place, or it could be something far more important. The good news is that your intuition is in fine form so use it to figure out the next step. Uranus’s position indicates that you  need to take ownership of the situation in order for it to improve.

"
7585,17 november 2016,cancer,"Keep your opinions to yourself over the next few days! A tough Neptune-North Node aspect could create foot-in-mouth syndrome in which your words, no matter how well you mean them, could be misinterpreted. This is especially true at the workplace, where you need to tread carefully around co-workers and clients. Say your piece after Neptune resumes direct motion on Saturday.

"
7586,18 november 2016,cancer,"Make sure that your opinions—and gut instincts—are the primary source when it comes to making decisions today, Cancer. A tough Mercury-Neptune standoff indicates that people around you may be trying to sway your opinion their way. Problem is, they could be operating with a hidden agenda. This is especially true in the workplace, where a client or co-worker may not be revealing all that they know. Just keep your nose to the grindstone, get your job done, then wait till next week when the fog clears.

"
7587,19 november 2016,cancer,"Good news! If projects at home or the office have been stalled, now they can start to pick up steam. Currently you have several planets in your house of productivity, which has forced you to slow down and focus on details and procedures. But Neptune has been retrograde for five months in your house of “the bigger picture”. Now that the watery planet has resumed direct motion you can start focusing on the overall plan rather than the minutiae. This doesn’t mean that you can take your eyes off the daily routine, but that more optimism and a sense of completion will be coming your way.

"
7588,20 november 2016,cancer,"Sure, it takes bright ideas to get ahead in the world and with Neptune now in direct motion, you should have no shortage of inspiration. But they need to be implemented and you have to develop the right skill set to do so. Today is perfect for considering the best habits and routines to follow, as well as how to become more of an authority in your field.

"
7589,21 november 2016,cancer,"If you have your health–both physical and emotional–you can move mountains, and that’s the situation that you can  be in. Now that the Sun is in your vitality sector, it’s up to you to eat well, work out and get enough sleep. And with go-getter Mars touring your house of deep emotions, it’s also up to you to get rid of the nyah-nyah stuff: jealousy, resentment, obsession, and fears of not being good enough, to name a few toxic terrors. Next week’s new moon on the 29th helps you open up a new chapter.

"
7590,22 november 2016,cancer,"A smooth running home environment is key to maintaining your serenity, not to mention your sanity. A helpful Mercury-Jupiter aspect will enable you to kick off a home organization plan that will set you up nicely for a more peaceful (and profitable!) 2017. Get the grunt work out of the way now, holidays be damned. You can thank me later.

"
7591,23 november 2016,cancer,"Use the holiday slowdown at the office to focus on where you’re heading with your job. Clear off your desk, empty out your e-mail account, review the roles your employees play, consider new service providers and come up with long term plans for the next year. The new moon next week on the 29th will fall in this part of your chart, so get a jump on this now. If it’s time to move to a different company, work on your resume over the weekend.

"
7592,24 november 2016,cancer,"Your desire for a peaceful home and family life could be thwarted today as people around you are in a touchy mood. More than touchy, actually.  They could be downright obnoxious! But this passes, and by the weekend you’ll at least have the opportunity to have a serious discussion with a romantic partner about where things are going. It’s possible that family members are opposed to your choice of romantic partner, or that a mixed family situation is off keel. You can get things back on track next week.

"
7593,25 november 2016,cancer,"A tug of war may be brewing between the demands of your family and those of a lover, with you caught in the middle. There just don’t seem to be enough hours in the day for you to manage the needs of loved ones and your career. The new moon on the 29th in your ultra-efficient sixth house will help you delve into time management practices that should lighten your load.

"
7594,26 november 2016,cancer,"Holiday weekend? What holiday weekend? The planets are focused on your career, Cancer, and the future is looking good. Today a sudden burst of inspiration could come your way that will help you on the job front. It could be the solution to a problem with employees or clients, a brainstorm about a new product or service you can add to your company’s lineup or a phone call from an industry contact who wants to toss an idea around. Next week’s new moon will help you take action.

"
7595,27 november 2016,cancer,"Grunt work is never sexy, whether it’s cleaning the house, doing homework or powering through the pile o’ papers on your desk at the office. But with so much planetary activity encouraging you to get your act together, you’d be wise to get cracking with organization and catching up. The good news is that a helpful Moon-Neptune aspect can help you find more creative ways to do so. An empty desk leads to a more fun-filled mind!

"
7596,28 november 2016,cancer,"Slow and steady wins the race, and the habits you establish in the days ahead can spell the difference between success or lackluster results. The planets are urging you to get house house in order, which literally means your home environment as well as the work flow at the office. The good news is that these new routines will spill over into other areas of your life, such as getting fit and carving out more family time.

"
7597,29 november 2016,cancer,"An assertive new moon in your house of getting things done could really light a fire under you to produce. But you need to make sure that you don’t burn out, a possibility under the current planetary aspects. Mars is pushing you to earn more, Jupiter is telling you to get your home environment organized and decorated, Saturn is urging you to get fit and healthy, and Venus wants you to have more love in your life. Unless you want to feel like a hamster on a wheel, pick just one or two priorities and go after them first.

"
7598,30 november 2016,cancer,"You’re ready to swing into action, thanks to yesterday’s new moon in your house of productivity. But Neptune is calling your name like the sirens from Greek mythology, the deceptive creatures that tried to lure sailors into crashing their ships into the rocky shoreline. This is no time for daydreams and fantasies. Get real and get things done.

"
7599,1 december 2016,cancer,"This is no time to keep your emotions under wraps. A sparkling aspect between Mars and Jupiter is all about letting others know how you feel—in love, business, and family matters. The upside to being so open is that it can pave the way for positive events in the near future. Your financial picture especially can improve, so ask for the loan, the order, or the joint venture.

"
7600,2 december 2016,cancer,"Yum. Effervescent Mercury zips into your house of romantic commitment today, just in time for the holiday season! Singles, the next few weeks are super for finding a serious contender, but put yourself out there before the 19th when Mercury goes retrograde. That being said, the cosmos still dishes up some positive aspects on the 24th and 25th, so don’t think that all is lost. Coupled up Cancers can work things out and find more quality time to enjoy each other’s company right now.

"
7601,3 december 2016,cancer,"Your finances can improve dramatically in the weeks ahead as a series of positive aspects helps you pitch ideas to clients, bosses, co-workers and prospective employers. But before you do, make sure that all of your handouts, contracts, resumes and other pieces are perfect. You will need the help of others right now as the planets indicate that teamwork is necessary. While you can’t control what they do, you do have ownership over your own conduct and presentation. Sparkle!

"
7602,4 december 2016,cancer,"This can be one heck of a passionate day as the Moon glides past Mars in one of the most stimulating parts of your chart! Most people think about sex and romance when they hear the word “passion”, but it can mean so much more. You can be passionate about your family, putting them first. You can be devoted to changing the world by being involved in a charity. Or you may spend your Sunday afternoons involved in a hobby or past time that makes your heart sing. Whatever uplifts you, make sure to partake in today.

"
7603,5 december 2016,cancer,"Building a solid financial base is what the planets are encouraging you to do, Cancer, and with the passionate Moon in fine form today you may hit upon a way to earn and save more. Fortunately this positive energy carries through into early 2017 with Venus entering this part of your chart tomorrow. Inspiration may strike out of the blue, and it’s also possible that someone may suggest entering into a joint venture.

"
7604,6 december 2016,cancer,"If you want to get something done, ask a busy person to help you. That saying may be true, as busy people tend to be efficient. But they also get taken advantage of, and that’s the risk you run in the next few weeks. With Mars and Venus in your house of sharing—work tasks, finances, emotions—you may be in demand as others ask for assistance. Pick and choose the people and activities you want to  be involved with, otherwise you’ll be in so deep that you won’t have time for yourself.

"
7605,7 december 2016,cancer,"You’re entering a highly cathartic period, considering that assertive Mars has been asking you to examine your deepest emotions. This is not always an easy task, but things should go smoother once Venus enters the same part of the sky today. This is especially helpful when it comes to matters of the heart. Next week’s full moon on Tuesday falls in your sector of healing and closure, so expect to release things that have been on your mind for far too long.

"
7606,8 december 2016,cancer,"The cosmos is lighting a major fire under your booty to go out there and make some serious coin. With assertive Mars and profitable Venus in your house of ambition, you have the smarts and the energy to pull off a nice success. Today you might suddenly decide to switch gears, though, or try a different angle or technique. Go for it. Success often requires a fresh way of thinking.

"
7607,9 december 2016,cancer,"As the Sun and Saturn move ever closer in the heavens, they’re asking you to focus on the balance of labor at your office or home. Basically, are you carrying most of the load while others slack? If that’s the case it’s time to issue some edicts. Saturday will be the day to pull out the guillotine and starting chopping people’s heads off, but today the planets provide you the opportunity to travel the kinder, gentler path of negotiating first.

"
7608,10 december 2016,cancer,"Your life needs to be running like a Swiss clock, and if it isn’t, you need to make some changes—stat! Serious Saturn asks you to examine your work habits, routines at home, and the efficiency of employees and co-workers. Everyone needs to be pulling their own weight. If they’re not, then it’s time to tell them to shape up or ship out. And speaking of weight—if yours is too high, Saturn demands that you address it. After all, this is the planet of no pain, no gain!

"
7609,11 december 2016,cancer,"Serious relationships are going through a transformation these days, courtesy of Pluto’s activity in the commitment part of your chart. Today helpful Pluto-Moon aspect will allow the two of you to discuss future plans and goals. This includes business alliances as well as personal ones. With next week’s full moon falling in your house of closure, it’s time for old projects, attitudes and ambitions to be either completed or tossed out so that new ones can begin.

"
7610,12 december 2016,cancer,"A bold idea might come your way, something that can catapult your career to a higher level. It may not have anything to do with a new line of work or inventing the next Spanx, but simply a better way of handling your existing projects and responsibilities. Don’t dismiss any idea as being foolish or impossible. Your intuition is on fire and could help you dream up some profitable new concepts.

"
7611,13 december 2016,cancer,"Close the door on the past, Cancer. Today’s full moon is in the part of your chart that deals with cleansing, healing and moving on. You may especially feel this surrounding work and health issues as the Moon opposes Saturn. It’s time to get real—and disciplined—when it comes to lingering health issues. Difficult co-workers, too much red tape, a job that doesn’t pay enough—if that’s what you’re dealing with, it may be time to move to greener pastures. The week after Christmas rocks for getting your name out there with a new moon in the career house.

"
7612,14 december 2016,cancer,"A person in a position of authority today may say or do something that will rattle your cage. The best advice, Cancer, is to bite your tongue and consider your next step. Yesterday’s full moon was in your house of closure, so if you’ve had it with someone’s attitude— a boss, a pompous client, a selfish lover—it may be time to move on. Quietly consider your options. With the Moon in Cancer your emotions may be high. Chill out and take your time before you make any major decisions.

"
7613,15 december 2016,cancer,"Now that the Moon has entered your sign, you may be feeling more passionate about your goals and ambitions. However, you seem to be surrounded by red tape, delays, and people who can’t figure out what they want to do next. Count to ten and breathe, Cancer. This soon shall pass. Saturday is a much better today to get things done and to communicate with The Confused People.

"
7614,17 december 2016,cancer,"Forge ahead with business deals and projects, as the Moon puts some passion in your efforts today. Regardless as to what co-workers, bosses or clients say or do, just keep plowing away. While you’re at it you may discover some helpful new routines and habits that will not only increase your ability to earn more, but your self-worth and serenity as well.

"
7615,18 december 2016,cancer,"Retail therapy isn’t the way to go today, nor is overspending on holiday gifts. With the emotional Moon in your house of savings opposing reckless Mars, it will be easy to burn through a wad of cash if you’re not careful. Hold on to your money, because when Mars changes signs tomorrow you’re going to need it for some lofty pursuits.

"
7616,19 december 2016,cancer,"Patience is a virtue, my Grandma used to say, and you’re going to need some in the weeks ahead! That’s because Mercury is retrograding in your partnership sector just as the Sun is firing up an independent streak. Relationship issues are going to come to the fore, and that includes baggage associated with an ex, who may decide to reappear on the scene in some fashion. Slow down and talk things over before heading to the door.

"
7617,20 december 2016,cancer,"You are determined to make your mark on the world now that dynamic Mars is in the highly public ninth house. But before you take your standing ovations before the crowd, you’ll need to ensure that anyone you’re partnering with is on the same page as you. This could be either a romantic liaison or a business one. Working with a partner right now can really add momentum to your ambitions, but only if the other party is as committed to your vision as you are.

"
7618,21 december 2016,cancer,"Sweet love! The mighty Sun enters your commitment sector today, making Cancers one of the most likely signs to hear wedding bells in the near future. Not to mention starting a family, cohabitating, meeting his or her parents, or simply growing closer to each other. But Mercury is  retrograde in this part of your chart, so if you want to make progress, first you have to clean up any “messes” or issues from the past. Singles, you’re in an excellent spot to meet a keeper, and with charismatic Mars in your house of open-mindedness, you could be attracted to someone who breaks the mold from the usual type.

"
7619,22 december 2016,cancer,"A power struggle may arise within the family or people close to you, and it may seem to come out of left field. As Jupiter begins to form an opposition to Uranus, an aspect that will culminate on the 26th, tensions could be growing as someone is trying to place themselves in a position of control. What you need to remember is that no one can call the shots in your life other than yourself, so don’t roll over and play dead for anyone.

"
7620,23 december 2016,cancer,"A creative or out-of-the-box idea can take flight with an auspicious Moon-Mars connection. Now that Mars is in your highly public house of big ideas and acclaim, you should be pushing hard to polish up brainstorms and written pieces that reflect your talent. When Uranus goes direct on the 29th, the brakes come off and you can showcase your work.

"
7621,24 december 2016,cancer,"You should be feeling more in charge of your life with maverick Uranus acting up in your house of authority. This is a good thing, Cancer! And it won’t be a fleeting moment, not with Saturn involved. It’s high time that you step into a place of greater respect and self-assurance. When Uranus turns direct on the 29th, your self-esteem and confidence will grow even more.

"
7622,25 december 2016,cancer,"Super swoony day with love planet Venus in a passionate mood! Couples could be talking about wedding plans, moving in together or starting a family. Singles could find new love this week, especially after the new moon on the 29th. But you could also find a greater sense of contentment and peace as Venus currently resides in the house of soulful catharsis.

"
7623,26 december 2016,cancer,"Too much work and not enough down time can make a Cancer pretty crabby. You could reach a saturation point today at which you realize that there’s more to life than just plowing through the work at the office. New Year’s Eve brings a terrific aspect that helps you break out of a rut and experience more joie de vivre.

"
7624,27 december 2016,cancer,"George Michael (may he rest in  peace) wrote and sang a fabulous song called “Freedom”, in which he says “I’ll hold on to my freedom. May not be what you want from me.” And today, the cosmos asks just how much freedom you need in a love relationship. The good news is that a positive Sun-Mars aspect will allow you to live your life within the constraints of a partnership–as long as you’re not too pushy about it!

"
7625,28 december 2016,cancer,"Trolls, doubters, and nay sayers will always be out there, but that doesn’t mean that you have to listen to them. You’re about to enter a highly productive time in which you can pursue so many things of interest to you. Listen to your own heart, not the “advice” of others.

"
7626,29 december 2016,cancer,"Confused about which direction to move in? Fortunately the fog should lift as erratic Uranus finally goes direct in your house of ambition and success. Not only that, romantic partnerships can start gaining momentum thanks to the new moon in Capricorn. Your optimism will start to rise, with New Year’s Day being a time for considering going after new goals that may have seemed laughable not too long ago.

"
7627,30 december 2016,cancer,"Don’t be surprised if you’re craving adventure, or just a break from the same old grind. Inspirational Neptune in your house of wide open spaces and travel is calling your name, and the watery planet isn’t going to let up any time soon! Plan a weekend escapade or a well-deserved vacation, even if you can’t get away for awhile.

"
7628,31 december 2016,cancer,"Who wants a buff body in 2017? Maybe the question should really be–who doesn’t? With Saturn, planet of discipline in your house of fitness, forming a glorious trine with Uranus, chances are your motivation is going to skyrocket. Uranus is in your take-charge sector, so you’ll toss out the lame excuses and take responsiblity for your health and wellness.

"
7629,1 january 2017,leo,"This could be one of your biggest years ever for a deep romantic commitment and raking in the big bucks, but first you need to do some inner work. As success coach Jim Rohn says, “Your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development, because success is something you attract by the person you become.” A Mars-Neptune meet up today urges you to release the negative parts of your psyche–resentment, fear, jealousy–in order to develop forward momentum.

"
7630,2 january 2017,leo,"It’s time to get real about matters of the heart, Leo. The passionate Moon, lusty Mars and amorous Neptune are all sequestered in your house of intimacy and libido right now, which can certainly turn up the heat! But the downside is that they might blind you to the truth about the relationship and the other person you’re involved with (or thinking about getting involved with!). Take your time and perform due diligence.

"
7631,3 january 2017,leo,"The ancient philosophy of Taoism produced some of the most amazing people this planet has ever seen: the warrior monks, martial arts experts who understood that the best way to maintain peace of mind was through rigorous training. But before they even set foot in the dojo, they needed to rid themselves of the mental and emotional baggage that was holding them down. Now that cathartic Venus has entered your house of psychological depth, you should do the same.

"
7632,4 january 2017,leo,"Mercury back spins into your fifth house of love and creativity today, which is a good news/bad news kind of a thing! It’s great for creatives as projects and clients you were working with in the fall and December can come back to life. If you think that taking a class or seminar will upgrade your skills, this is a great time to sign up. Now for love. Exes can come crawling out from underneath their rocks between now and the 12th (Good? Bad? It depends on how you feel about the person. If in doubt, block your phone and e-mail account.) Attached lions will need to work out relationship issues between now and the full moon on the 12th, and that includes matters that involve your kids.

"
7633,5 january 2017,leo,"You could suddenly be inspired to pull out all the stops today and go for it, whatever “it” means to you! But your actions may be premature, and in your rush you could overlook key details. Slow down and set aside some time this weekend for strategizing, a must considering that powerful Pluto and the brilliant Sun will be meeting in your house of streamlining, details and organization. Mercury will resume direct motion on Sunday, allowing your creativity to flourish.

"
7634,6 january 2017,leo,"Leos usually never shirk from drama, but you may be getting tired of life being a soap opera. Even if you’re not intrinsically a part of an ongoing stage play, such as the ones being put on by the office divas or your family, chances are you don’t want to be a spectator either. The good news is that Mercury’s return to direct motion on Sunday should calm things down a bit. Besides, you’ve got bigger fish to fry. Next week’s full moon in Cancer signals an end to things that have reached their sell-by date and a new chapter opening up.

"
7635,7 january 2017,leo,"This could be one of the biggest days for you in 2017 Leo, as powerhouse Pluto and the Sun meet up in your house of strategizing and getting organized. Don’t underestimate this, as the decisions and plans you set in motion today could have far reaching consequences. If you’re the “big picture” type who’s great with overall concepts but not the details, you’re going to have to get down to the nitty gritty. The key is to analyze your habits and procedures both at home and at work, and how they affect all areas of your life, from fitness to saving cash to the way you get through chores and assignments. Then make a vow to 86 the things that aren’t working and replace them with new systems that do. You can thank me later in December.

"
7636,8 january 2017,leo,"Too much drama can be draining, and with a full moon arriving this Thursday in your house of peace and serenity, chances are you’re not interested in dealing with divas, malcontents and even loved ones who want to stir up trouble. Fortunately Mercury goes direct in the sector that deals with kids and romantic partners, so at least they  should settle down. This is also a bonus for creatives and those Leos who need to think in more conceptual ways in their line of work, as this sector governs innovation and talent.

"
7637,9 january 2017,leo,"You seem to be in a mood to cooperate and work with others, so what the hell is their problem? If you spend too much time trying to figure that out today you’ll get nowhere but frustrated, Leo. Tomorrow there may be more of the same, so your best move is to take a vow of silence for the next 48 hours and let them stew.

"
7638,10 january 2017,leo,"Keep your head down at the office and just plug away at your work. Expressing your opinions or providing your input could backfire today, even if you’re 100% right and the input is valuable. Do you have employees working for you? Then dole out instructions and criticism carefully, as people could be touchy—and uncooperative.

"
7639,11 january 2017,leo,"You’re a natural born leader, Leo, and with both the Sun and Pluto in your house of work assignments, you are ready to cut through tasks like a hot knife through butter. These are the two most authoritative orbs in the cosmos, so while they can motivate they also can make you a tad opinionated. Watch your words today. Even if you’re as silent as the grave, others may be interested in getting in your face. Hmmm…are they resentful of your ambition and upward trajectory?

"
7640,12 january 2017,leo,"You can put lipstick on a pig, but that sow is still a pig, Leo! Stop trying to get people and circumstances to be something they’re not. The full moon in Cancer is telling you to put an end to useless dramas and situations so that you can move on. With Mercury moving into your take-charge sixth house, joining the Sun and Pluto, you’re ready to get important things done. Too bad other people in your environs aren’t as motivated. Cut bait and move upstream.

"
7641,13 january 2017,leo,"It’s a good thing for all signs of the zodiac when the Moon enters Leo for the weekend, but it’s even better for you! Yesterday’s full moon in Cancer told you to say goodbye to the kaka of life, and now that La Luna has glided into your house, you can kick off new initiatives with even greater ease. A powerful Venus-Neptune aspect is perfect for doing some much-needed inner work.

"
7642,14 january 2017,leo,"It’s a fabulous time to get fit, Leo. With the Sun, Pluto and Mercury all in your house of wellness and vitality, get going with the diet and exercise program, along with visiting doctors who can help you heal chronic problems. The full moon on Thursday occurred in your house of endings, and the ancients included ending illnesses as part of this sector. Both physical and emotional ailments can be treated and disposed of effectively under these powerful planetary aspects.

"
7643,15 january 2017,leo,"It’s time to get down to the nitty gritty when it comes to a project or plan that can take you far. Lofty ideas are fine, but they need to be executed in order to pay off. Right now it’s wiser to stay focused on what’s right in front of you–the process-than the end result. It will come in its own time.

"
7644,16 january 2017,leo,"We’re two weeks into 2017, and if you’ve already fallen off the resolution bandwagon today gives you the chance to climb back on it. A sparkling Moon-Pluto aspect allows you to analyze your habits and routines so that you can switch them up. The desire to make changes isn’t always enough: if it’s not backed by a solid set of habits, plans won’t take off.

"
7645,17 january 2017,leo,"What you think and what you say should be two different things, especially at the office. Besides, why waste time trying to explain things to people who can’t figure things out for themselves? Sit back and let them make their own mistakes–then maybe they’ll be more willing to listen to sound advice.

"
7646,18 january 2017,leo,"“Take your passion and make it happen!” Remember that from the movie Flashdance ? Today a happy Mars-Jupiter aspect tells you to dive into your passion projects. It appears that they may need some revisions, or a different way to approach them, but if you take a different approach you’ll get better, faster results.

"
7647,19 january 2017,leo,"Projects that you’ve been working on may seem stuck in the mire, and frustration could be building on your part. Where’s the money, dammit? You’re pouring your heart and soul into your work, but progress is slow. Blame it all on a tough Mars-Saturn square in the heavens. They’re both stubborn little buggers, and Saturn demands that you become better at your craft in order to see mo’ money. This vibe isn’t going away soon, so get cracking.

"
7648,20 january 2017,leo,"You’re in an interesting spot, Leo. The upcoming lunar eclipse on February 11th is designed to put your needs and plans front and center. Yet the Sun entered your partnership house yesterday for a four-week stay. Over the next few years  you will be torn between flying solo or developing close relationships with others. That’s because there will be a series of eclipses in Leo that continue into 2019 which will create the need for balance between your goals, and the desires of loved ones and business contacts.

"
7649,21 january 2017,leo,"A number of planets have been active in your financial security house lately, encouraging you to get a handle on spending and saving. It seems that you need more peace of mind in all  areas of your life, so a good place to start is right here. You should only be buying the basics. Don’t worry, this austerity plan won’t last forever. Next month’s lunar eclipse in your sign will help open up new doors.

"
7650,22 january 2017,leo,"“I adore simple pleasures” said Oscar Wilde, who really knew what he was talking about as the bon vivant of his day. Well, take a page out of the Oscar handbook, Leo, because the planets are telling you to indulge in enjoyment! Whatever it is that floats your boat, get to it. This vibe continues into Monday. Now is also the perfect time to indulge in new hobbies, sports or forms of entertainment.

"
7651,23 january 2017,leo,"Keep your emotions in check and rely more on rational thought. Someone may try to push your buttons with the usual smarmy tactics: guilt, criticism, demands, or a superior attitude. Ignore their petty dramas and stay on task with what you have planned for the day. Tomorrow’s a much better day for gaining cooperation.

"
7652,24 january 2017,leo,"With three planets in your highly emotional eighth house—Neptune, Mars and Venus—you may find that you’re experiencing knee jerk reactions to the things that people say and do. Even a traffic jam is enough to set you off. Fortunately intelligent Mercury steps in today and tells you to take a deep breath, slow down and take one minute at a time, one task at a time. It’s high time that you look after your physical and emotional health, Leo.

"
7653,25 january 2017,leo,"The planets are lighting a fire under you to get organized, Leo, a trend that has been going on for awhile and shows no signs of letting up. Today the Moon gets into the action, helping you become even more inspired to transform your routines and habits. By the end of this week you’ll be glad that you did, as your life is going to become more action packed—but in a good way! A new moon kicks open a fabulous phase in romance and Mars enters your house of adventure. Trust me, there will be no time for cleaning out the garage.

"
7654,26 january 2017,leo,"Reaching down into the deepest wells of your passion and emotion should be easy today with a helpful Jupiter-Venus connection. Naturally this can help you enormously in matters of the heart, but it can also be a big bonus in your career. These are the two planets that govern profits, so taking your passion for your work and channeling it can result in bigger bucks later this year.

"
7655,27 january 2017,leo,"What’s going on with you, Leo? Is your love life taking a back seat to your job? It sure looks that way from the positions of the planets. There’s a new moon today in your house of forming deep connections, but the office and household chores are also calling your name thanks to Mercury and Pluto in your ultra-organized sixth house. The key is to find balance between the two, which also includes taking darn good care of your health and fitness levels. If you’re wondering how you’re going to fit all of this in, don’t worry. When Mars enters Aries on Saturday you’ll be able to figure it out.

"
7656,28 january 2017,leo,"If any sign of the zodiac is ready for fresh new experiences it’s you, Leo! Throw open the windows of your life and let the stale air out. Now that megawatt Mars has entered your house of mind expansion, travel, freedom and adventure, it’s time to enjoy some new experiences–not to mention new people! Over the next two months some folks with interesting perspectives could come your way. Honey, you’ve got places to go and people to meet.

"
7657,29 january 2017,leo,"Think big but work small. That’s the message the cosmos is delivering to you, Leo. You’re in a superb spot right now to visualize in a more revolutionary way, thanks to mighty Mars moving into your lofty and philosophical ninth house yesterday. With transformative and sturdy Pluto in your strategizing and details sector, you can easily take expansive projects and figure out the steps you need to complete them. Get moving.

"
7658,30 january 2017,leo,"Passion, practicality, visionary ideas—these are all yours for the taking, Leo. Recent planetary aspects have set the stage for you to think intelligently with both  sides of your brain. This could, however, create a bit of a tussle as you try to figure out how to get things done the right way yet still have a sense of adventure. Don’t worry, lion—it can be done! It takes courage, but you’re not short on that, are you?

"
7659,31 january 2017,leo,"The devil is in the details, Leo. You may be raring to go with a plan but the cosmos warns that you may have overlooked a few integral components. The good news is that Mars and Uranus are in the most visionary part of your chart, turning you into an idea factory. The bad news is that these are two of the most impatient, hot-headed orbs in the solar system. Take time to do things right, and to give others whose cooperation you need the chance to get on board.

"
7660,1 february 2017,leo,"Something could happen today that might rattle your confidence. Someone could dish out some criticism, or try to pull rank. The key is to try to remain as objective as possible and not put on your own bossy pants in retaliation. With Venus getting ready to enter your house of authority you won’t need to beat anyone over the head to show them your smarts. They’ll find out in a much more subtle way.

"
7661,3 february 2017,leo,"Everyone is entitled to my opinion! Leo, if you have something to say, then say it….on the biggest platform you can find. With planet of ease Venus in your house of expression, the next four weeks are perfect for being loud and proud. Defend your thesis, launch a marketing campaign, use social media to promote your brand, schedule media interviews, write a book, or start a career in public speaking. Just make sure that everything is perfect beforehand as Jupiter will retrograde in a rather detailed sector on Monday. If you have any doubts about a presentation, hold back and seek a second opinion.

"
7662,4 february 2017,leo,"Taking your job home with you? That’s not OK if you’re so stressed that you can’t enjoy your down time. But it is  OK if you use your annoyance to come up with a Plan B—which is what the cosmos is suggesting you do. With a megawatt lunar eclipse arriving next Friday in Leo, you’ll be more than ready to make some major moves in all areas of your life. Happy with your career? Then use this weekend’s energy to plan the next big step.

"
7663,5 february 2017,leo,"There is something in life called “tough love” and sometimes you need to mete it out. Your chart indicates that someone close to you has to get their life together and that you’ve been trying to help them see the light. Problem is, they’re either not willing or ready to take your advice. So be it. Step away and let them figure it out for themselves.

"
7664,6 february 2017,leo,"Back to the old drawing board. Hold off on major launches or debuts until everything is “ready for prime time”. Jupiter has just gone retrograde in your third house of thinking, writing and all forms of self-expression. While you may become frustrated at projects taking longer to gel than usual, the good news is that the slower pace will help you work out kinks and potentially embarrassing and costly mistakes. Take a close look at your brand, if you have one, and make sure that it reflects the very best of you. Find a mentor, sign up for webinars or take a class that will sharpen your skills.

"
7665,7 february 2017,leo,"With Friday’s lunar eclipse taking place in your sign, chances are that you’re already thinking about your own needs rather than those of others. This isn’t selfish though–it’s a healthy energy. If you have your act together, the better parent, spouse, employee, boss or friend you’ll be. And now that intelligent Mercury is in your house of one-on-one relationships you can relate to people in a more constructive way. Listen to them, pay attention, but remember that your needs must also be met.
 

"
7666,8 february 2017,leo,"Walk softly and say little, Leo. A tense Moon-Pluto opposition could bring out the diva side of others and words might fly. If they do, make sure that you’re not the one saying or texting them. You’re about to enter a highly metamorphic time once the Leo lunar eclipse takes place this weekend. Keep your mind firmly focused on your own plans and keep out of the dramas that others want to create.

"
7667,9 february 2017,leo,"With Friday’s impending lunar eclipse falling in your sign, Leo, you may already be taking stock of your life and the changes you’d like to make. Today a fabulous Sun-Uranus aspect could spark your desire to live more of “la vida loca” when it comes to romance. If your love life is about as exciting as watching paint dry, it’s time for a reboot–and you’re the one who needs to do it.

"
7668,10 february 2017,leo,"RAWR!! Don’t hold back there, regal lion. There’s a lunar eclipse tonight in the heavens and it has your name written all over it. This is a huge  game changer as it’s the first eclipse in a series that will run until 2019. Just about every aspect of your life can change between now and then, and quickly at that. A terrific Moon-Jupiter aspect is suitable for launching a makeover. Writing projects, such as blogging or penning a book, are favored right now along with killing it in social media and the news media too. Oh, and your love life is heating up whether you’re single or attached with long-term Saturn in a good mood. This is your night, Leo—get out there and shine!

"
7669,11 february 2017,leo,"You are your own best salesperson these days thanks to the lucky eclipse in your sign last night. It sets up six months of time in which you can shamelessly self-promote. With optimistic Jupiter giving you the gift of gab and sober Saturn lending gravitas, your words and ideas will impress others. This is true whether you’re trying to land more business, get your kids to clean their rooms or ask someone out on a date. Don’t hold back, Leo!

"
7670,12 february 2017,leo,"The recent eclipse in your sign was like a gift card from the cosmos to use in any way you please. Initiatives begun now could start to bear fruit by your birthday season. But the planets warn against happy-happy, fluffy pink cloud kind of thinking today when it comes to finances. If one of your goals is to earn more and develop a stable financial foundation, then you need to get real about where you currently stand.

"
7671,13 february 2017,leo,"The moody Moon may have you concerned about expenses and savings. You’re smart to be thinking about your finances because the Sun will soon be entering Pisces, your house of wealth. Passive income streams or side businesses are especially favored in the months ahead, and the solar eclipse on the 26th will illuminate some bright ideas for you.
 

"
7672,14 february 2017,leo,"What a lineup you have for Valentine’s Day, Leo! First, long-term Saturn is in your house of romance. It sends glorious beams to the Sun, currently in the commitment sector. And with Mars and Venus, the planets of amour, in your adventurous and optimistic ninth house, you’ll be interested in love that makes your heart sing. No safe but boring romances for you, lion. But then I wouldn’t expect anything less of you.

"
7673,15 february 2017,leo,"No matter how confident you are about your opinion, and how optimistic you may be that your ideas will be accepted, planetary activity suggests otherwise. Energetic Mars is blasting a path through your blue-skies-ahead ninth house, filling that brain of yours with brilliant and out-of-the-box ideas, but people around you may be stuck in doing things the same old way. No matter. Keep charging forward and keep those gems to yourself.

"
7674,16 february 2017,leo,"Sometimes it’s best to pay attention to your own inner wisdom; other times you should seek advice from a mentor or expert. The latter is what the cosmos has in mind for you, Leo. Over the next few days ask yourself whom you can reach out to who will be able to give you the honest feedback, strategy or knowledge you need.

"
7675,17 february 2017,leo,"You’re more than willing to be a team player, but you’re not  willing to be someone’s enabler, Mommy, maid or doormat. If anyone thinks otherwise they need to be put on notice that they need to start dealing with their own dramas and be responsible for their duties. Take care of this issue now, others it could be a bigger problem during the Pisces time period.

"
7676,18 february 2017,leo,"If you have been trying to get closer to someone emotionally, the next four weeks should be the right time to forge a deeper connection. Today the Sun enters Pisces, your eighth house of intimacy and sharing. There have been a series of eclipses in this part of your chart since 2015 with one last one scheduled for the 26th. Progress may have been slow, but now things start to develop momentum.

"
7677,19 february 2017,leo,"Color outside the lines, Leo. Your sign isn’t known for playing it safe, but sometimes you can get set in your ways. Add a little flair to your life with a new look in your hair or wardrobe. Head to a cultural event that’s different than the usual. Look into a new sport or hobby that you’ve been planning on doing “someday”. With the Sun in your house of passion, it’s time to get excited about life again.

"
7678,20 february 2017,leo,"Meet and greet! The cosmos suggests that you expand your contact list, Leo. A lion may be a solitary, fierce predator but they’ve also got the urge to hang out with a tribe built into their DNA. Collaborations with others are highly advised in the weeks ahead, and it looks like you’re about to meet some interesting people. Keep an open mind and see where these connections lead.

"
7679,21 february 2017,leo,"Hesitant to express your feelings or thoughts with someone? Today the floodgates open thanks to a harmonious trine between Jupiter and Mercury. Jupiter is retrograde, which could find you choosing your words carefully. But with a solar eclipse coming in your house of passion this Sunday, there really is no point in hiding your emotions or ideas.

"
7680,22 february 2017,leo,"Finding the right balance between perfectionism and big-picture thinking could be difficult today, Leo. Go-getter Mars has you anxious to get things done, and we’re not talking the “small potatoes” stuff either. But subterranean Pluto warns that if you go too fast you’ll gloss over important details, not to mention pissing off people who aren’t operating at the same warp speed as you.

"
7681,23 february 2017,leo,"Your sign is known for its creativity, and with mature Saturn in your house of skill development you would be wise to devote time on a regular basis to your craft, whatever it might be. Hobbies and sports are included here, along with the talents you bring to being a wonderful parent or savvy business person. Practice makes perfect.

"
7682,24 february 2017,leo,"It’s a dreamy day as two of the most passionate orbs, the Moon and Venus, wink at each other across the heavens. While this naturally bodes well for romance, it can also spur you to daydream about some of the juicier things you want in your life–exciting vacations, running your own business or writing an Oscar-winning screenplay as examples. Let your imagination rip, Leo, because a highly inspirational time is about to open up for you.

"
7683,25 february 2017,leo,"If your life has been a bit….dry and boring lately (yawn), get ready for an injection of joy and passion, Leo! Vivacious Mercury has just entered your house of joy and spirited excitement, which will be felt in all areas of your life: romance, work, going out, hobbies, you name it. A solar eclipse tomorrow in the same sector will vault you out of a rut and into a far more interesting place, so dust yourself off and clean the cobwebs from your mind.

"
7684,26 february 2017,leo,"It’s time to see green, Leo–lots  of it. A solar eclipse in your house of BIG money occurs today, and it’s the final one in a series that has been going on since 2015. No doubt you’ve been pushing hard since then, perhaps with not a lot to show for it. That’s about to change as the eclipse represents the final round of effort. By the time your birthday rolls around you should be seeing the fruits of your labor.

"
7685,27 february 2017,leo,"Pick just one or two good ideas to pursue, Leo, and work them until you’ve reached mastery. With so much positive planetary action in the most mental and expressive parts of your chart, you could easily get overwhelmed by options. Yesterday’s solar eclipse fell in your house of passion, so mojo is not a problem; being selective is.

"
7686,28 february 2017,leo,"No matter how tempted you are to roar, fierce lion, it isn’t worth it today. Other people around you may be slacking, BS’ing and spouting whacked out opinions, but your best choice of action is to ignore them. Trying to reach a consensus ain’t gonna happen. You might as well be talking to a wall. Slink off to your lair or cubicle and do your own thing

"
7687,1 march 2017,leo,"A lot has been said about manifesting, thanks to books like The Secret.  Whether you believe in the power of visualization or not, know that an auspicious meeting of the Sun and Neptune will provide you with the inspiration to create wealth. Don’t hold yourself back with limiting thoughts about what is do-able. However, you’d be wise to keep your dreams to yourself as the trolls and dream-stealers will be out there, ready to strike.

"
7688,4 march 2017,leo,"Some ambitious plans of yours may need to be slowed down a bit now that Venus has retrograded in your optimistic sector of big thinking. However, this doesn’t mean that you should settle for table scraps and think small! By all means, let your creativity flow. But really think about the practical aspects of implementing them. In love, you may start feeling restless—and a little lusty too. Hmmm….time for a fling?

"
7689,5 march 2017,leo,"Start getting clear about some ideas you’d like to pursue: a trip around the world, penning a novel, going back to school for an advanced degree, moving to a new location, starting a business or revamping your image. A superb Mars-Saturn aspect helps you think outside of the box. When Mars moves into your ambition sector this Thursday, swing into action.

"
7690,6 march 2017,leo,"Want to see more green? As in–dinero? There are basically two types of income, active and passive. The passive kind falls under the eighth house, which for you is lit up like a Christmas tree all week. Today intelligent Mercury holds a conference with the Sun as they brainstorm ways to increase your bottom line: rental real estate, royalties, licensing, stock market investing, and creating a side business that doesn’t require a lot of time. Take this energy and run with it, leo–all the way to the bank.

"
7691,7 march 2017,leo,"Sometimes you need to focus on minute details and strategy; other times it’s wiser to forget the little things while you let you mind think in big brush strokes. Today’s a “big picture thinking” kind of a day, so let your imagination and creativity rip. Your ideas have merit, and by mid-week you’ll be able to chunk them down into a plan.

"
7692,8 march 2017,leo,"Dragging your feet as you accomplish projects or goals is no way to go about things, Leo. Fortunately your passion will rise this week as the Sun and Mercury are active in your house of loving life and getting things done with a sense of purpose and zeal. Sometimes you need to think of life as a game—a fun activity in which there are many winners, you being one of them.

"
7693,9 march 2017,leo,"You are in one SWEET spot, Leo! Energetic Mars enters your house of ambition today for the first time in two years. Create a short list of the goals you’d like to achieve over the next six months and get to work on them. Better yet is the full moon that’s coming on the 12th which falls in your income sector. If career advancement and a higher income are on your list, this is a terrific time to pursue them. But from your chart it appears that you need to develop better daily habits and routines. Remain focused and don’t take on too much in too short a time.

"
7694,10 march 2017,leo,"Some practical ways for boosting your net worth are available, Leo, but you’re going to have to do a little digging to find them. Fortunately Saturn, the planet of long term success, is stirring up your creative mojo. This energy continues over the weekend and peaks nicely with Sunday’s full moon in your earnings sector. You’re about to turn a corner in your financial life—make sure you’re paying attention to ideas that pop into your head.

"
7695,12 march 2017,leo,"A luscious full moon could bring about major changes in your finances and career, Leo! Super-charged Mars just entered your ambition sector, and tonight’s lunation is in your house of income and savings. Some juicy new projects could come your way too. But the planets suggest that you become more disciplined in your habits, and that you don’t expect overnight success with cash pouring in the door. You can pull off a big coup if you develop routines that enable your talents to flow.

"
7696,13 march 2017,leo,"Damn your chart looks good! Megawatt Mars just entered your house of goals and ambition last Thursday. Then last night there was a  full moon in your income sector. And today intelligent Mercury zips into the house of large scale thinking and planning. Let’s put it this way, Leo–aspects like these don’t come along every day. Your opportunity for making headway in your career and income are terrific.

"
7697,14 march 2017,leo,"News or an unusual situation could come your way that might throw you off your game. Chances are it will happen at the workplace, but it could also be at home. Someone may resist your efforts or a project you’re working on, and it could be a person whom you wouldn’t have expected. This is a theme that will continue into next week, particularly around the 23rd, so it ain’t over tonight at sunset. Take it in stride and figure out how to get things done without them.

"
7698,15 march 2017,leo,"It’s not your karma to be struggling financially, Leo. You won’t get to heaven faster that way, nor will you enjoy the trip on this side of the veil! A happy Moon-Mars aspect reminds you that you can earn more, live a better lifestyle and actually enjoy the journey.

"
7699,16 march 2017,leo,"The Taoists say that the true master lives in the “center of the circle”, which is kind of like the eye of a hurricane. No matter what is going on around you, the key is to remain calm and unperturbed. Easier said than done, you say? Maybe! But a helpful Moon-Neptune aspect can put you in that place today. Once you get there, you’ll never want to leave.

"
7700,17 march 2017,leo,"Falling in love—or expressing your love—can be rapturous. And with the Sun in the most passionate part of your chart, you may be ready to shout your love from the mountaintops. But wise old Saturn sternly advises you to simmer down and restrain yourself. From your chart it appears that you either need to learn more about your lover, reset your timetable or let the other person be demonstrative for once.

"
7701,18 march 2017,leo,"The next two months could end up being a very expansive time for you, Leo. Your mind will turn to taking risks as you try new things, some of which may push you past your comfort zone. But all growth comes with a bit of a shock. You could get a taste of what’s coming today as brainiac Mercury meets up with magnetic Venus. Start dreaming up new ideas for the future, because when the Sun changes signs on Monday, a new chapter opens.

"
7702,20 march 2017,leo,"If you find yourself craving more freedom and spontaneity, Leo, blame it on the Sun’s entry into Aries! You’re what is known as a fixed sign, not always open to change. But your eyes are going to be opened to new possibilities and perspectives over the next four weeks, and chances are you’ll take a risk and develop some exciting plans. It’s also a smart time to learn more and develop your talents.

"
7703,21 march 2017,leo,"From your chart it appears that you have way too many projects going on and that it will be difficult to complete them all. Take a look at your habits and routines to see what you can change and streamline. Otherwise, some of your plans may need to be postponed until a further date. Try to do a few things with excellence rather than many things haphazardly.

"
7704,22 march 2017,leo,"Try to accomplish as much as you can today with a project or work assignment, as the end of the week brings a rather difficult T-square. With the Moon and Pluto in your house of productivity, you are one efficient machine. Too bad your co-workers or family members aren’t, something that will become apparent over the next few days. Don’t wait for them to get their acts together–so your own thing.

"
7705,23 march 2017,leo,"You’re about to enter a very organized phase in which being efficient at home and at work will mean a lot to you. Today the Moon makes it clear that in order to achieve your big plans, you have to have better habits and strategies. From your chart it appears that you’ve bitten off more than you can chew. Take a step back and consider ways to either cut out extraneous activities or find a better way to fit them into your schedule.

"
7706,24 march 2017,leo,"Thanks to bountiful Jupiter in your house if thinking and speaking, you have no shortage of bright ideas, nor are you worried about sharing them. And with Mercury in your house of big picture concepts, you are also thinking outside the box. But you run the risk of being overwhelmed today with too may facts, brainstorms and paths to take. Spend the weekend creating a short list. Once the new moon arrives next Tuesday you can pick the best option or two, and then run with them.

"
7707,25 march 2017,leo,"Feeling entrepreneurial? Ready to embark on an exciting trek to a new land? Willing to buckle down at a university or trade school in order to secure your future? A sense of optimism and adventure is building, Leo, and you’re in one heck of a sweet spot to run with it. Mars is providing you with the energy and ambition over the next few weeks, and today Venus will help you draw in the resources you need to make things happen.

"
7708,26 march 2017,leo,"With motivator Mars blasting through the most ambitious part of your chart, you’re pretty much unstoppable these days, Leo. The best part is that planets in your blue-skies-ahead, big picture sector are active as well, helping you paint the future picture in bold brushstrokes. Today smart Mercury and spontaneous Uranus unite to blow the cobwebs from your mind and fill it with genius concepts.

"
7709,27 march 2017,leo,"Nothing of value was ever achieved without passion, Leo, and you should possess it in abundance. The emotional Moon meets up with vibey Venus in your bold, brilliant ninth house of big picture thinking today, to be followed by a new moon tomorrow. This is one of your best times all year to take ideas and run with them. The worldwide stage awaits.

"
7710,28 march 2017,leo,"Despite Leo’s reputation for being proud and fierce, you’re not as adventurous as the other signs, preferring to relax in your lair. Which is fine—unless the lair becomes a rut. Well, the cosmos is hell bent on expanding your world, which starts with expanding your viewpoint. The new moon in Aries will jumpstart a new chapter in which you’ll start to become more curious and motivated to try new things: vacation destinations, a brand new occupation, a different self-image, reading books and socializing with folks who are a different breed than the usual.

"
7711,29 march 2017,leo,"Something that you’ve been working on is now at a place where you have to give it more effort, and fortunately the cosmos is by your side. An energetic meeting between Mercury and Saturn will boost your creativity and overall vision to greater heights. It’s all about thinking on a grander scale, Leo. Small thoughts create wimpy results, and you don’t settle for table scraps!

"
7712,30 march 2017,leo,"Can’t see the forest for the trees? That may happen as a confusing Jupiter-Pluto aspect turns your focus to the small stuff instead of the bigger picture. It may not be your fault, however—colleagues or family members may be so bogged down in minutiae that they pull you into it as well. Don’t worry—intelligent Mercury enters your ambition sector tomorrow, so you’ll regain your focus within the next 24 hours.

"
7713,31 march 2017,leo,"Your motivation level has undoubtedly increased thanks to hosting red hot Mars in your ambition sector over the past few weeks. Get ready for a second blast of energy as Mercury buzzes in there today too. This is one of your best times all year to make progress with all of your big plans, but try to get as much done as you can now. Pay attention to details too, as Mercury will be retrograding on April 9th.

"
7714,1 april 2017,leo,"It’s all fine and good to dream about working a better job, changing occupations or starting your own business—but what about the money component? What kind of income can you expect to earn? Now that Venus is just about ready to backslide into your net worth sector, you need to seriously consider the bottom line. Maybe you can start a side business while staying at the day job. Perhaps some kind of passive income stream would be the way to go. Consider your options between  now and April 15th, at which time you can start taking action.

"
7715,2 april 2017,leo,"It’s time to release the past when it comes to romance, Leo: grudges, resentment, that torch you’re still carrying or fears of getting intimate. Whether it’s a lover who hurt you years ago or a current amour who’s pushing your buttons, you need to make a decision about the kind of life you intend to live. Love planet Venus is now retrograding though your intimate and emotional eighth house til the 15th. Are you going to choose happiness, or drama?

"
7716,3 april 2017,leo,"The planets are trying to push you past your comfort zone, something that we all need from time to time. But the usually fearless lion seems stuck in a comfortable groove, whether it’s in matters of the heart, career, family or residence. Well, that’s about to change, Leo. With four planets going retrograde this month you’ll be doing a lot of reflecting about where you are and what needs to change.

"
7717,4 april 2017,leo,"You’re rather obsessive these days about achieving your goals, thanks to assertive Mars barreling through your house of ambition. But you run the risk of burning out, mentally and emotionally more than physically. You must  take some down time to relax and regroup. When Saturn begins to retrograde on Thursday in your house of living life to the fullest, you’ll learn some valuable lessons about stopping to smell the roses.

"
7718,5 april 2017,leo,"With the Moon in your sign you may be feeling more focused than usual on your needs and image. Fortunately inspirational Neptune is standing along the sidelines, encouraging you to get in touch with a more sensual, artistic and even metaphysical side. It’s never too late to nurture that side of yourself.

"
7719,6 april 2017,leo,"Celibacy may actually be looking like an option now that Saturn is back stroking through your house of amour! While I’m joking a bit here, the reality is that all lions will be reconsidering their love lives. You may be wondering if a relationship is worth it or if you’re with the right person. Married Leos could feel that the sizzle has gone out of the union. But Saturn is the planet of long term stability, so if you put some effort into making things work you can experience progress.

"
7720,7 april 2017,leo,"Diplomacy is the word o’ the day, Leo! Unless you want to make enemies, watch that you don’t bloviate, bluff or schmooze. You could also be at the receiving end of someone who’s blowing a lot of smoke in your direction. The smartest thing to do is to say as little as possible, be it verbally or in writing—which includes e-mails, texts and contracts.

"
7721,8 april 2017,leo,"Creative projects and other matters that involve talent can really start to soar, Leo. The full moon on Tuesday in your third house of self-expression allows you to dazzle. But you can’t just be all ideas and no grunt work. Take your ideas and figure out the specific tasks that need to be accomplished in order to take them from the concept stage to reality.

"
7722,9 april 2017,leo,"Even though the two most unstoppable planets–Mars and Pluto–met up in your efficiency sector a few days ago, inspiring you to blast forward with your plans, you need to pause and reflect. Mercury retrogrades today in your house of ambition, telling you to cool your jets. Between now and April 20th you should be asking yourself if you’re going about things the right way. Make the necessary changes and move on.

"
7723,10 april 2017,leo,"Got an idea that you’d like to run with? Then go for it, Leo! And stay away from dream stealers who will tell you that it’s impossible or can’t be done. Tomorrow’s full moon is the perfect aspect for launching a pet project or plan. Don’t listen to people who are so set in their own ways that they can’s see past the end of their noses.

"
7724,11 april 2017,leo,"A sparkling full moon in Libra is just the ticket for making presentations, expressing your opinion and promoting your brand or company. Better yet is the strong presence of Saturn in your talent sector, which will allow you to develop even more skills. The key to finessing this lunation is to take your time, do things right, work independently and don’t expect overnight success. Do that and you’ll get results.

"
7725,12 april 2017,leo,"Generosity is a treasured asset, Leo, and today’s Moon-Neptune aspect will open up your heart to helping others in need, whether it’s a kind word or a financial gift. But your sign is known for being excessive at times, so limit your largesse. It’s one thing to be a giver and another to be an enabler.

"
7726,13 april 2017,leo,"A friend of famed artist Georgia O’Keeffe said that she “never allowed her life to be one thing and her painting another. She has never left her life in disorder while she sat down to paint.” Neatness and minimalism were found in her home, just as it was part of her art. The planets are urging you to create a home environment that is streamlined and functional.

"
7727,14 april 2017,leo,"You’re in quite a brainy mood this week, thanks to the recent full moon in your house of self-expression. And today brilliant ideas pour in, thanks to a powerful Sun-Uranus conjunction. Uranus is the planet of genius, so get ready for innovative perceptions and concepts to come your way. Then go loud and proud with them. Next week the Sun enters the most ambitious part of your chart; consider today’s conjunction as an early gift from the cosmos.

"
7728,15 april 2017,leo,"Cue the BeeGees, circa 1977: How deep is your love? That’s been the question over the past month as romantic Venus was retrograde in your house of intimacy. It stations direct today, helping to end drama, confusion and unhappy emotions. Truth be told, if a romance isn’t putting a smile on your face it may be time to vamanos. But today’s aspect could also open up a new chapter of relating and sexual closeness.

"
7729,16 april 2017,leo,"Your eyes will be opened to new possibilities this weekend, thanks to a happy Venus-Mars meet up. This includes romance as well as career and money-making opportunities, so pay attention to any thoughts that pop into your mind, even if they seem random. Now that Venus is direct in your house of intimacy and  wealth you can score big in both areas.

"
7730,17 april 2017,leo,"You’ve never been one to follow the herd. Heck no, you feel most comfortable being a leader, and today’s Sun-Saturn convo puts you front and center. A megawatt trine, the best angle possible, helps you shape a creative vision and run with it. In the near future people will come into your life who are noticing your ideas. Be ready to show them how good you are.

"
7731,18 april 2017,leo,"There’s an old saying: you can either have your own plan for what you’d like to see happen, or you can be a part of someone else’s plan. The cosmos is urging you, fierce lion, to start taking more control over matters, especially at the workplace. While no one’s telling you to become a tyrant–and you can’t magically make obnoxious co-workers and bosses disappear–you can still try to develop a greater sense of control, even if that simply means your emotions or how you manage your time.

"
7732,19 april 2017,leo,"It’s time to pounce, lion! The Sun has entered your house of ambition, so no cat napping for you over the next four weeks. Your optimism and desire for progress will increase significantly, but don’t expect overnight success. Four planets in retrograde are going to force you to examine all of your plans with a microscope before they can really pick up speed. But that’s OK: moving too quickly often produces mistakes, and they cost time and money.

"
7733,20 april 2017,leo,"You’re raring to go, lion, as the Sun makes its annual trek through your ambition sector. Problem is, Pluto retrogrades in the house that governs your habits, systems and the people you rely on to help you get your job done. Before you plunge headlong into a new endeavor, examine your routines for weaknesses and take care of them. Slacker employees? Get rid of them. Slacker co-workers? Steer clear and do your own thing. Pluto governs hidden snarky types so you may become aware of a few in the office. Keep calm and carry on.

"
7734,21 april 2017,leo,"Lions are interesting animals: they can act as a lone predator, quietly stalking their prey (or ambitions), but they also know how to hang with their tribe. Over the next few weeks it would be in your best interest to be a team player as Mars has entered your house of networking. It should also be a social time too, so bring on the brunches, cocktails and long chats with friends. This sector also governs technology, so you can really kick butt with a website launch or social media campaign—not to mention finding love online.

"
7735,23 april 2017,leo,"A sexy, soulful day is ahead with the passionate Moon and Venus meeting up in your house of intimacy and libido. Push your household chores to the side and simply enjoy the presence of your loved one. Single, or not happy in love? Then take good care of yourself. This is also the sector of emotional healing, so modalities like meditation, reiki, and good old fashioned massages at the spa can help you get relaxed and grounded again.

"
7736,24 april 2017,leo,"Doing things the same old way may have worked for you in the past, Leo, but the cosmos is telling you to go deep into your well of creativity and think in more innovative ways. A new moon is coming on Wednesday in your career and goal sector, enabling you to take your ideas and run with them. However, a stunning Mercury-Saturn trine today in the most creative parts of your chart suggests that you start thinking outside the box. Expand your mind to experience a different level of success.

"
7737,25 april 2017,leo,"You’re entering one of the most creative phases of 2017, Leo, welcome news as your sign is known for being the artistes  of the zodiac. A superb meeting of rule-breaker Uranus and disciplined Saturn encourages you to take a different approach to the way you go about your job, decorate your home, the way you dress, and in general, the manner in which you express yourself. If signing up for a class or working with a coach would be the best way to develop your talent, then do so, as the results will pay off big time.

"
7738,26 april 2017,leo,"“In the jungle, the quiet jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…”  Remember that song? Consider it a past memory, Leo, because you won’t be lounging around sleeping for the next few months. Au contraire, the cosmos is lighting a fire under your feline rear end to get moving. Today’s new moon occurs in your house of ambition and success. This is your annual gift from the heavens to manifest the things that are the most important to you. And you won’t be thinking small, either: magnetic Venus will be gliding into your big-picture thinking sector on Friday.

"
7739,27 april 2017,leo,"The new moon yesterday kicked off one of the most ambitious periods of the year for you, Leo, and you shouldn’t be wasting a moment of it. Today is the perfect time to gain control of your physical workplace, from the piles of paper on your desk to your e-mail inbox. You won’t be able to achieve your goals with lousy habits and routines. A strong Pluto aspect tells you to get the nitty gritty done first.

"
7740,28 april 2017,leo,"The great big world beckons, Leo, so it’s time to slink out of your lair and be a part of a bigger scene. Venus has just entered your expansive ninth house of international affairs, publishing, media attention, earning a higher degree and extensive travel. It just so happens that this sector includes love and money, and we’re not talking about boring dates and chump change. You want the sweeter things in life? Hunt them down and make them yours.

"
7741,29 april 2017,leo,"What you want to do with your life is your choice, Leo, and is not up for discussion with the people in your world. They may need to be reminded of that fact, unfortunately. You have a lot of planetary energy pushing you to achieve things—big things at that. If your friends, family of lover are threatened by your ambitious attitude, that’s their problem, not yours.

"
7742,30 april 2017,leo,"Take a few steps back in order to leap miles ahead, Leo. The recent new moon in your ambitious tenth house is stirring your desire to get ahead, that’s for sure. But some quiet strategizing is in order as the intuitive Moon glides through the part of your chart that deals with reflection. Work out the details now before you take that leap.

"
7743,1 may 2017,leo,"An unexpected development might occur in one of your biggest plans, something that catches you off guard. It could be finding out that the college of your choice has waitlisted you. Your citizenship application may have gotten held up. Travel plans have to be rescheduled. Whatever it is, you may feel deflated or emotional, but chill. Once Mercury resumes direct motion on Wednesday things will bolt forward.

"
7744,2 may 2017,leo,"Yeah, baby! The Moon is in your sign and it’s winking at red hot Mars. This is a super aspect for networking with other people, so make plans for Sunday brunch or Friday night cocktails. Head off to a seminar, trade show or convention where people will be congregating who share your interests. Go to a singles event, church group meeting or get involved in charity work. Your life is about to get a whole lot bigger.

"
7745,3 may 2017,leo,"The brakes come off now that Mercury is finally direct in the most freewheeling, visionary part of your chart. Whether you want to travel around the world, go back to school, become the next Bill Gates or join the Peace Corps, you can take action. Inspirational Neptune is in a terrific spot, helping you think in bolder terms than usual. But with the Sun in structured Taurus you’ll also possess logical thought.

"
7746,4 may 2017,leo,"Your financial future is connected to how much risk you’re willing to take, Leo. You’re a fixed sign by nature, not always willing to bolt out of your comfort zone. A gentle Venus-Moon aspect asks you to reconsider your options and to take a wider view. Are you truly happy in your line of work, for example? You may be surprised to find that you could earn more in an occupation that’s a better match for your talent.

"
7747,6 may 2017,leo,"Mental stumbling blocks may be getting in your way, Leo, especially when it comes to making money. You may be thinking that you don’t have the creativity or the know-how in order to make the serious stuff. But wealth is in your grasp, and with the Sun touring the most ambitious part of your chart you’re in a super position to land big bucks. Seek out the advice you need or take classes to develop your talents.

"
7748,7 may 2017,leo,"Feeling flirty…and maybe a little dirty? It’s quite possible with the passionate Moon snuggling up to juicy Jupiter in your house of conversation! Everyone thinks that the typical Leo is a sexy creature, always slinking around confidently, just oozing allure. But there are quiet, more restrained Leos out there. The cosmos tells you to start working your sex appeal in a slightly more apparent way.

"
7749,8 may 2017,leo,"Pretend that you’re a politician being interviewed and that everything you say will be scrutinized and disseminated. That’s the game to play today with a stinky Moon-Mercury opposition, which is another way of saying, “Loose lips sink ships!” Keep your remarks (both verbal and written) short, factual and logical. Keep emotions out of the mix. Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to vent later in the week.

"
7750,9 may 2017,leo,"Ready to assume the role of captain of the ship? Good, because the planets want to put you there! A fabulous meeting of the two most authoritative orbs, the Sun and Pluto, helps put you at the helm. The next few days are superb for showcasing your talent, interviewing for a new job or taking charge of a group effort. It’s also a smart time to strategize, and from your chart it looks like world domination is the end goal.

"
7751,10 may 2017,leo,"Tonight’s full moon could tug at you from all directions, Leo! It occurs in your cozy, domestic sector of home and family. There is a strong nesting vibe at play, encouraging you to settle down, redecorate or even move to new digs. But at the same time ultra-spontaneous Uranus is acting up, saying “WTF? Take a risk, babe! It’s time for some adventure.”  So what’s a lion to do? The choice is yours to make. Mega watt Mars is blasting through the house that governs your fondest hopes and dreams, so pick the top one and go after it.

"
7752,11 may 2017,leo,"You’re one ambitious soul these days thanks to the Sun blazing a path through your house of goals and success. And today El Sol forms a glorious aspect with power broker Pluto, helping you make progress. This is an excellent time to reach out to decision makers, land a more prestigious position or score a new assignment that will build your reputation. Intelligent Mercury is pushing you to think in creative new ways from its perching your visionary ninth house, so sticking to the tried and true—even though it may be working just fine, thank you very much—may actually hold you back a bit. Don’t be afraid to take a calculated risk.

"
7753,12 may 2017,leo,"The planet of motivation meets up with the planet of abundance today, an auspicious aspect for setting things in motion that are important to you. Mars and Jupiter form a trine in the heavens, the best angle possible in astrology. With Mars in the house of self-expression and Jupiter in the networking sector, your best chances for success are by joining forces with others, rather than trying to go it alone. Find a coach or a mentor. Talk to as many people as you can. Don’t be shy about self promotion (like that should be a problem for a Leo, duh). Want media attention? It could happen.

"
7754,13 may 2017,leo,"When the emotional Moon meets up with mature and disciplined Saturn, sometimes a clash ensues. But these two orbs conjunct in your house of creativity and romance today which is fabulous! In matters of the heart you can find long lasting commitment, full of passion but without childish antics. And you’re also encouraged to take that same passion and apply it to your career and other big ambitions. Schedule regular brainstorming sessions, or time in the studio, or weekend hours just to chill with your hobbies.

"
7755,14 may 2017,leo,"Taking on too much of a friend’s problems? It’s nice to be a shoulder for someone else to cry on, whether it’s a pal, co-worker or family member. But sometimes you just have to let some people figure things out for themselves. This isn’t cruel; folks need to learn from their own mistakes and problems and develop their own wisdom. Besides, your sign has a tendency to want to rush in and fix everything. Don’t.

"
7756,15 may 2017,leo,"Motivation strikes today and hits hard! Whether you decide to clean out the black holes otherwise known as your closets, start working out (for real this time), or catch up on old work assignments, you’ll be working with the energy of the cosmos. Tough guy Pluto is acting like a boot camp instructor, kicking your sorry feline ass into action. Good thing, too—Mercury enters your house of ambition tomorrow.

"
7757,17 may 2017,leo,"You’re a proud creature with healthy self-esteem, but you’d be wise to remember that you’ll need the cooperation of others to get ahead in this world. The Moon in Gemini will help you find the most diplomatic way of connecting with folks, whether it’s in business, your family or your love life. If you have a point you need to get across do so before Friday, when a stinky opposition will close off others’ minds for a few days.

"
7758,18 may 2017,leo,"Confusion is in the air over the next few days, Leo. It could come from within—you may not be able to make a decision about a long term plan or big vision that you’re working on. Or it could come from the people around you, who seem to be hell bent on talking in circles and possibly bulls***ting you along the way. But sit tight. Once the Sun rolls into Gemini on Saturday the mist will clear and so will the path ahead.

"
7759,19 may 2017,leo,"From your chart it appears that you’ve been laboring away at something that’s close to your heart, wondering when the glorious day will appear when you can take this dream and run with it. Well, that day is here, Leo, as Saturn and Uranus form the most beneficial aspect possible, a trine. Whether the dream is to find love, get a book published, travel around the world, have your art showcased in a gallery, conceive a baby, or launch a killer blog, “someday” is here. These two planets will be traveling close to each other between now and November, when this rare aspect will repeat once more. Use the next six months for one last push.

"
7760,20 may 2017,leo,"The mighty lion likes to travel with its tribe, and now that the Sun is in Gemini you’re in the perfect spot to socialize. Gemini is your house of teamwork and networking too, not just partying with your pals. Spend the next four weeks expanding your contact list, whether it’s for business, volunteer work, getting to know the neighbors or looking for love. This is also your tech sector, so any kind of internet-based project should really pick up momentum between now and the Cancer time period.

"
7761,21 may 2017,leo,"Sometimes you need to rally the troops (kids, co-workers, friends) and sometimes you just have to rally yourself. The good news is that this week’s planetary energy is all about developing momentum, and it starts today with the Moon in energetic Aries. So get your pep talk ready, and if that means talking to yourself in more positive terms–affirmations, thinking happier thoughts, experiencing gratitude–then so be it.

"
7762,22 may 2017,leo,"Nothing of value is ever achieved without passion and you should have it in spades today, Leo. Magnetic Venus meets up with the ardent Moon, fueling your desire to live life a lot more authentically. Why sit along the sidelines watching everyone else have a life? Lucky for you, this Thursday’s new moon will stoke you even more to chase after rainbows.

"
7763,23 may 2017,leo,"There’s something called “the creative process”, Leo, something that your sign is well aware of. After all, you’re the artists and innovators of the zodiac. But it can’t be rushed! With disciplined Saturn spending only seven more months in your house of talent, you should be focusing on developing your skills rather than chasing after the end goal. It doesn’t matter if you’re trying to become a better parent, graphic artist, CEO or gardener—put in the grunt work and the results will take care of themselves.

"
7764,24 may 2017,leo,"Tough guy Pluto is in your house of habits and efficiency, playing the role of boot camp instructor who tells you to drop to the floor and do 100 pushups. Except he’s telling you to get caught up on your errands, e-mails, and work projects. Oh, and while you’re at it, get back on the old diet and exercise routine. With the Moon in the most ambitious part of your chart you might actually feel like doing the grunt work! Until tomorrow, when lazy Venus feels like slacking. Keep your eye on the prize.

"
7765,25 may 2017,leo,"You’re usually pretty comfortable being the leader of the pack, a good thing considering today’s new moon in the teamwork part of your chart. Even if you prefer to go it alone, over the next few weeks you may still have to collaborate or make nice with others. You’re going to need a lot of diplomacy as a tough Venus-Pluto aspect indicates that there are malcontents in your midst. That’s OK: with energetic Mars in this part of your chart also you’ll be able to get things done. Just don’t mow people over.

"
7766,26 may 2017,leo,"You’ll be in a highly philosophical mood today and over the weekend, Leo, and this is a good thing. Don’t worry, you won’t spend Memorial Day weekend with your nose in a book written by Descartes or Jean-Paul Sartre. This is a happier, more bubbly mood in which you take on a different kind of attitude, living for the now rather than the future. But feel free to read a helpful book if it helps you gain the right perspective.

"
7767,27 may 2017,leo,"You weren’t put on this planet to be a work horse or someone’s maid, and the recent new moon should have reminded you of that fact! It occurred in one of the most festive parts of your chart so clear your schedule for some good times. It’s time to be a bit more adventurous in your tastes, whether that means in lovers, the kind of clothes you wear or the places you go for relaxation and culture. If anyone is cramping your style it’s time for a reality check.

"
7768,28 may 2017,leo,"Is there something that you’ve been interested in doing for years…but you never had the guts? Or maybe you were lacking the funds or the connections. Perhaps you were mired in emotional dramas that took up too much of your time and energy. Neptune is inspiring you to find the right solution and move past the limitations.

"
7769,29 may 2017,leo,"Setting boundaries with other people is not necessarily your strong suit. You tend to be fiercely loyal even to those who haven’t been the best of friends or lovers, giving them plenty of chances to redeem themselves. But things may be reaching critical mass in a particular relationship and it may be time to pull away. This doesn’t mean ending the connection. A cool breeze coming from your direction may be all it takes to make someone wake up.

"
7770,30 may 2017,leo,"Your spirits will rise considerably, thanks to a happy meeting between energetic Mars and spunky Uranus in the two  most buoyant parts of your chart. Take this energy and run with it, Leo! You’ve been carrying a heavier load than usual over the past few months and it’s time to let your hair down a little. Shake that mane and think about some new possibilities.

"
7771,31 may 2017,leo,"You can focus on the trivial nonsense that comes your way–from family, co-workers, the news media or your pals–or you can focus on what’s most important and get things done. Buddha said that we become what we think about. Consider that wise advice the next time you’re tempted to indulge in minutiae.

"
7772,1 june 2017,leo,"Staid Saturn has been in your house of skill development and talent over the past two years, demanding that you pay attention to your “craft”, whatever that might be: being a fabulous mom, an organized and productive employee or a savvy business owner. Today Venus adds a sizzling dose of creativity to your efforts. Don’t stick with the tried and true; add some some fresh new techniques to your repertoire.

"
7773,1 june 2016,leo,"The Sun and Venus are pushing you to go after your dreams, and so you should! But a tough angle today between the Sun and Neptune could throw up a roadblock. You may realize that you need more cash to finance a big plan. Perhaps the issue isn’t money, but a shortage of creative ideas. Neptune does control inspiration, and she may be withholding her gifts over the next few days. Have no fear. The roadblocks start to disappear next Monday.

"
7774,2 june 2017,leo,"Yowza! You have no shortage of ideas, that’s for sure. With optimistic Jupiter stirring up your brainy side, the problem is figuring out which idea to go after first. The best bet under current planetary auspices is to run your thoughts past a seasoned expert or friend who can point out the flaws and genius in your plans. The good news is that charismatic Venus enters your house of ambition next week, so you’ll be able to draw the right people and resources to you.

"
7775,2 june 2016,leo,"Were you put on this earth to work a sh** job? Are you destined to be a corporate drone, slogging away every day just to make someone rich? Were you an axe murderer in a former life and now your karma is to suffer? No, no and NO! Come on, Leo. You were destined for bigger things than this, and today’s Moon-North Node angle is going to point that out to you. Not only that, inspirational Neptune is in a super angle, helping you come up with fresh new ideas for your future.

"
7776,3 june 2017,leo,"Forget about thinking “out of the box”. Leos are able to think outside of this galaxy, thanks to a powerful meeting of Uranus and Venus. Uranus is known as the planet of genius, the orb that has inspired everyone from Einstein to Jobs to Mother Teresa. And with Venus nearby, taking brilliant new ideas and running with them should be easier than ever. Our golden girl is all about taking the silky smooth path, rather than the one loaded with pot holes. But you might want to keep your brainstorms to yourself, at least for a month or two. Mars enters your secretive twelfth house tomorrow, so discretion is key.

7777,3 june 2016,leo,"Aargh! it’s a planetary pissfest with five planets pulling and tugging on each other in a Grand Cross. What’s a regal lion to do? Let’s face it, you’re not exactly the wallflower of the zodiac. You adore the finer things in life and like to spend time with both friends and lovers alike. But the Sun and Venus in your house of pals is annoyed with Saturn in your house of love. Why can’t we all get along—and open up that bottle of Cristal together? Oh, by the way—Pluto in your financial security department is questioning the need for Cristal when a bottle of cheap Asti will do instead. Or maybe the wine that comes in a box. Yup, you’re going to have to scale back a bit when it comes to spending, and make some decisions about the people you hang with. It’s not like solving the crisis in the Middle East but it’s still a pain!

"
7778,4 june 2017,leo,"Lions know how and when to pounce: on an opportunity, an enemy or just having a good time. But do you know how to pull back and go within, regal one? Even a proud Leo is nursing past traumas, habits that need to be broken or negative thought patterns that need to be broken. The problem is that your pride will often prevent you from admitting your issues to others, so you’ll have to do some important inner work by yourself. That’s OK. You have the chops to do it. The upside is that you’ll emerge at birthday time stronger, happier and more serene for your efforts.

"
7779,5 june 2017,leo,"Teamwork could get a bit tricky with a Neptune-Sun square. There seems to be a big divide between those who think rationally and those who are in fantasy land. This can really get dicey if money or budgets are involved, so stay on your toes. Be discerning about what you share with others and how committed you want to be with this group or relationship.

"
7780,6 june 2017,leo,"Yeah, baby! Profits planet Venus enters your house of ambition and success. Sometimes going after what we want can seem like scaling Mount Everest, full of pitfalls, long hours and gritted teeth. But with Venus now in this part of your chart a sense of relaxation and ease should start to seep into your daily efforts. If you believe in the power of attraction, now is the time to put it into play.

"
7781,7 june 2017,leo,"The old saying, “It’s now what you know but who you know” applies to lions these days. Strategic Mercury is now in your house of networking, whether you schmooze potential clients or party with your friends. A BFF could be instrumental in introducing you to a new love, tipping you off about a job opening or serve as a good sounding board. It’s also an excellent time to find a mentor, coach or join a mastermind group. Work your connections as best you can between now and the 21st.

"
7782,8 june 2017,leo,"Relating to loved ones gets easier with a sweet Jupiter-Neptune aspect. Sometimes you just have to stop worrying about things that may never happen, and let the negativity of the past be a distant memory. A new chapter is about to begin in your personal life after Friday’s full moon. Listen to what others have to say and think about how you’d like the next year to progress with these folks.

"
7783,10 june 2017,leo,"You’re in a bit of an odd spot, Leo. Mars just entered your hush-hush twelfth house, the place where we work best in solitude. But happy-go-lucky Jupiter resumes direct motion in your chatty communications sector. The best way to finesse this energy is to diligently work on any project that deals with self-expression behind closed doors, at least for now. Polish up your portfolio or resume. Strategize. Learn how to work Photoshop or a graphic arts program—or hire a designer to work their magic on your promotional pieces. Develop a product line. Refresh your brand. Inspiration will be running high, spot take advantage of it.

"
7784,11 june 2017,leo,"The North Node of the Moon points out the path we should take in our life’s journey. Today the Node is active, telling you to take a more creative approach. This could be in the way you dress or cook, all the way to your choice of occupation. Study the lives of people who’ve marched to the beat of their own drum for inspiration.

"
7785,12 june 2017,leo,"Now that Jupiter is direct your ability to be diplomatic has returned, so use it to your advantage. This is especially true when it comes to networking with other people or cooperating with clients and co-workers. You may not agree with them—heck, you may not even like them!—but sometimes you just need to put that aside. You’ll be more serene as a result.

"
7786,13 june 2017,leo,"Despite your valiant efforts to be a team player, others may not be willing to play along. This is true of lovers, family members, co-workers or people you deal with on a volunteer basis. Some may report to emotional blackmail, passive aggressive BS or deception. This is a theme that reoccurs over the next two weeks, so go into “wise sage” mode and say as little as possible. The ancient Taoists said that the true master “resides in the center of the circle”; stay in the eye of the hurricane and you’ll remain at peace.

"
7787,14 june 2017,leo,"Tap in to your own wisdom these days, Leo, as it will provide you with better guidance than the people around you can. Sometimes the stars suggest finding a mentor or talking to a close confidante; other times they advise that you rely on yourself. The latter is important this week and next. Listen to what others have to say, but primarily rely on your own judgment.

"
7788,15 june 2017,leo,"With wise Saturn, the planet known as the teacher of the solar system, active in your creativity sector, you should have no shortage of bright ideas. And if you’re smart you should be devoting time every day to developing your craft. But a Sun-Saturn opposition today indicates that there is more that needs to be done. Are team members doing their share? Is it time to hook up with a mentor for some stellar advice? Consider what other people can and should be bringing to the table.

"
7789,16 june 2017,leo,"The languid lion can often be rather blasé about their finances, but that’s about to change. Neptune retrogrades today in your net worth and wealth sector, telling you to snap out of it! Be careful before investing your time and money in a venture. Study your bank and credit card statements. Carefully vet big ticket spending, such as buying a house. Obfuscation runs high with this aspect, so don’t let someone sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.

"
7790,17 june 2017,leo,"You’re entering a deep period of psychic and emotional awareness, Leo, one of the most intense in years. Over the next week alone you may decide to cut off the outside world to a certain extent and go within. You would be wise to do so. With so much planetary firepower arriving in late July and through most of August, you need to get clear about your journey.

"
7791,18 june 2017,leo,"Your dreams can take flight, Leo. The Sun is currently in the part of your chart that deals with your fondest hopes and wishes, and today it shakes hands with genius Uranus in the most adventurous sector there is. This is no time for holding back! But with the Sun about to enter Cancer, plan cautiously before you proceed. No Icarus-type thinking allowed.

"
7792,19 june 2017,leo,"Are you and someone close on the same wavelength? From your chart it appears that some friction has arisen due to fundamental differences in opinion or values. This doesn’t need to be a deal breaker, but if a relationship is fraught with too many problems or inconsistencies it may be time to reconsider the union.

"
7793,20 june 2017,leo,"A smart idea can become a brilliant one under today’s cosmic aspects, Leo! This is no time for thinking small. Let your imagination rip, then get ready for working in seclusion. The Sun enters the most confidential part of your chart tomorrow, the place where we hole ourselves away and create a magnum opus.

"
7794,21 june 2017,leo,"The Cancer season is here, typically the quietest time of the year for you. Maybe not on the outside—your daily schedule may be as busy as ever—but mentally. Pull away from the madding crowd a bit and do some deep reflecting about where you’re heading next in your life. Leo, you have some amazing  planetary aspects coming your way in four weeks. Make sure that you’re emotionally and mentally ready to take advantage of them.

"
7795,22 june 2017,leo,"The fierce lion tends to tackle problems head on—which means poised and ready to strike. But now that shrewd Mercury is in your secluded house of working behind the scenes, it’s time to get away from full frontal behavior. You know how to quietly sit on your haunches and observe your prey. Conserve your energy.

"
7796,23 june 2017,leo,"Sometimes we get so caught up in thinking about what’s going wrong in our lives that we can’t see (or appreciate) what’s going right. Fortunately the emotional Moon meets up with two illuminating and logical orbs, the Sun and Mercury, in the house of psychological health. You’re in an excellent spot to see things for the way they really are.

"
7797,24 june 2017,leo,"Today brings the annual new moon in the sector that encourages you to let go of people, habits, thought patterns and circumstances that are no longer helping you on your path. With Venus in a good supporting role, you can take control of your life without a lot of drama and anxiety. Not everyone may support your new direction, but chances are they’re the people who need to go!

"
7798,25 june 2017,leo,"Got a gut feeling about something or someone? Then double check it and be sure to use rational thinking when you do. Your intuition may be off today due to a Mars-Jupiter square, and a similar aspect shows up again on Tuesday. But on Wednesday it should be right on target, so wait til then before making any big decisions.

"
7799,26 june 2017,leo,"Trusting your own thoughts and gut feelings becomes easier with a magnificent Mars-Neptune trine. Take note: your intuition will be razor sharp this week, so listen to what it has to say rather than the advice of others. People may try to sway you to their way of thinking, or bamboozle you with bulls***, but your own internal guidance system will be spot on.

"
7800,27 june 2017,leo,"You have some big decisions to make Leo, but these are not the outwardly noticeable kind, like moving to a new city or losing weight. These have to do with your mental health and the kind of thoughts you allow to occupy your mind. It’s time to take out the emotional trash. Are you brave enough to release your victim stories?

"
7801,27 june 2016,leo,"My, my, don’t we have a mystery woman or man on the prowl! As Mercury joins Venus in the most secluded part of your chart, you can stalk your prey (romantic or business, choose your victim!) without leaving a trace. Neptune’s dreamy presence indicates that you could be feeling quite sexy in the process. Do you want that martini shaken, or stirred?

"
7802,28 june 2017,leo,"Done. Completely done. That’s the mood today as the cosmos serves up a powerful aspect, that of intelligent Mercury meeting up with ambitious Mars in the house of your subconscious mind. Bon voyage, bad habits. Hasta la vista, toxic ties. Buh bye feeling sad and gloomy. This lion’s ready to move on.

"
7803,28 june 2016,leo,"Time for Plan B. Jupiter’s been in your corner for the last ten months, aiming to increase your income. A helpful angle between Jupiter and the Moon suggests that it’s time to tweak your plans a bit for maximum impact. Pluto tells you that doing things the same old way is just going to give you the same old results.

"
7804,29 june 2017,leo,"Old habits die hard, something that may become apparent with a harsh Mercury-Pluto opposition! Scientists say that our habits actually create “neural pathways” in the brain, like a well-traveled road your mind wants to travel. Remember this if you’re trying to make changes. That old “roadway” needs to be torn up and a new one built in its place.

"
7805,29 june 2016,leo,"“Aha!” moments can hit us at the most unexpected times, and today could provide one of those brief moments of illumination. The Moon swings past high-charged Uranus in the most free-thinking part of your chart, so don’t be surprised if a fresh new concept or understanding comes your way. Better yet? La Luna scampers into your ambition sector a few hours later, pushing you to take that nugget of inspiration and do something with it!

"
7806,30 june 2017,leo,"Getting out of your own way is key over the next few weeks, lion. Listen, unless you go the Henry David Thoreau route and live in the woods by yourself, there will always be people around you with agendas and attitudes. But the #1 person you need to “tackle” is yourself. Do the important inner work now and reap the rewards by your birthday.

"
7807,30 june 2016,leo,"Let your inner radar be your guide. A tough opposition between Venus and Pluto could cause you to doubt someone’s motives. It doesn’t mean, however, that someone is deliberately trying to deceive you, but there may be an undercurrent that you need to keep an eye on.

"
7808,1 july 2017,leo,"Be kinder to yourself, Leo! A sweet lunar aspect suggests that you’ve been putting yourself down, and it’s time for some self love. Quit worrying about what everyone else is thinking and doing and just focus on you for awhile.

"
7809,1 july 2016,leo,"Sshhhh! Got a business plan or idea rolling around in that brain of yours? If so, get moving with it, but keep the details to yourself. As a matter of fact, Leo, the first two weeks of July demand that you keep your lips zipped about everything.  A host of planets in your confidentiality sector are working on your behalf, from love to money to career and health, but you don’t need to go public on Facebook with the scoop. Today is all about making more money, and the best source of advice and wisdom is your own intuition.

"
7810,2 july 2017,leo,"You’re currently in quite a practical place, Leo, in all areas of your life. The cosmos is demanding that you tighten up your routines and habits, get your house in order and finish incomplete tasks at the office. And this may mean doing some inner work as well. Procrastination, feeling overwhelmed, and refusing to deal with the reality of your responsibilities has to go. The full moon on the 8th will make that clear!

"
7811,2 july 2016,leo,"No sign of the zodiac has more secrets than you right now, Leo! Your mind is privately ruminating, assessing, analyzing and projecting into the future. It’s not so much that you’re hiding anything, but keeping your thoughts to yourself. And today you will be considering the children in your life and a lover (or the lack of one). The planets suggest that you need to readjust the manner in which you deal with these folks and your emotions. Any Leo in an artistic field should be considering their craft and the best way to perfect it, demonstrate it, and profit by it.

"
7812,3 july 2017,leo,"Feeling more settled and secure at home base is on the planets’ agenda today for you, Leo. Whether a pressing family issue is taken care of or you just start to feel more relaxed and at peace, this is a good day to chill out and take good care of you.

"
7813,3 july 2016,leo,"Neptune is known for creating confusion, and now that it’s retrograde there may be conundrums spinning through your head that you’re trying to sort out. Relief is on the way, thanks to a strong Sun-Neptune trine that will help clear up matters. Things will become even clearer on Tuesday.

"
7814,4 july 2017,leo,"The connections you make in July could be quite important, Leo, so make an attempt to meet new people–whether it’s in person or online. Venus has just entered your house of networking and friendship, a superb aspect for sharing ideas (and cocktails) with like minded people. Don’t share too much too soon, though, as the Sun and Mars are in the most confidential part of your chart.

"
7815,4 july 2016,leo,"With the new moon in the most secluded part of your chart, you will be able to come to grips with a number of situations that have been on your mind as of late. Neptune has been stirring up your deepest emotions, but with Mercury’s help you’ll be able to pinpoint the best way to resolve them. The next six months can be life changing, but first you need to take out the “trash”.

"
7816,5 july 2017,leo,"Mercury enters your sign today, the perfect aspect for expressing yourself both verbally or in writing. But with other planets in your house of confidentiality you would be wise to keep certain pieces of information to yourself. Not everyone needs to know every bloody detail of your life–or where you’re heading!

"
7817,5 july 2016,leo,"Your intuition should be off the charts today, due to a trine between Mercury and Neptune. The watery planet is known also as the artist’s muse, so if you’re looking for artistic and business inspiration, it’s there. Reach out and grab it.

"
7818,6 july 2017,leo,"You may have strong opinions about things but if you’re wise you will keep them to yourself over the next 48 hours. Not everyone can handle the unvarnished truth, nor are they as practical as you are these days. Let them figure things out for themselves. In the meantime, carry on.

"
7819,6 july 2016,leo,"As Mercury glides past the Sun in the most metaphysical part of your chart, your intuitive abilities will be right on point. Venus is also in this part of the sky, shedding light on which direction you need to head in and easing the way. With other planets in your family, love and money sectors all forming positive angles, you can make excellent progress in these areas. Between now and the time that the Sun enters Leo, you will be withdrawing and working in solitude….but that’s the best way to go right now.

"
7820,7 july 2017,leo,"You may need to readjust your relationship with a friend or acquaintance, Leo. Now that easy going Venus is in your house of camaraderie, you’ll have no trouble making new connections. But does everyone deserve to be in the inner circle? Pick and choose the people who rate that status.

"
7821,7 july 2016,leo,"Red alert: difficult day ahead in the cosmos. Keep your lips zipped at the office, and tread carefully with professors if you’re a student. The people you work with could be into power plays, but you are actually in a strong position. Your intuition is in fine form, helping you outsmart the boss wannabes and the tyrants. Things bounce back tomorrow, so just let it ride.

"
7822,8 july 2017,leo,"Nothing is going to get in the way of the fierce lion. Tonight’s full moon in your most energetic, let’s-get-things-done sector paves the way for a torrent of activity that’s about to take place. Losing weight, toning up, cleaning the house, catching up on work assignments–heck, you’re even going to get ahead of them! But this is a good thing. August promises to be one of the most amazing months ever, so you need to be primed and ready to go.

"
7823,8 july 2016,leo,"If you’ve been holding back, fearing to boldly move ahead when it comes to earning more (I believe they call it “fear of success”), it’s time to take your foot off the brake…and floor it! A beneficial aspect between Mercury, in your highly intuitive twelfth house, and profitable Jupiter encourages you to get moving.

"
7824,9 july 2017,leo,"Your intuition can serve you well these days, Leo, considering that the Sun and Mars are both in the house of the subconscious mind. But you need to put in the grunt work if you want to use it to your fullest advantage. That means that you need to take the time to meditate, journal your dreams, and basically slow down to become more mindful.

"
7825,9 july 2016,leo,"Still waters run deep, and with so many planets in your perceptive twelfth house right now, your intuition is your best guide. A secret meeting between the Moon and hit-it-big Jupiter in your income sector bodes well for making progress in this part of your life. Don’t pooh-pooh any ideas that come your way as being outlandish or impossible. Security is the name of the game.

"
7826,10 july 2017,leo,"Today’s a tense one for all signs of the zodiac with a showdown between two powerful orbs: the Sun and Pluto. People could be in quite a bossy or critical mood. But whereas other signs have the green light to blast the offending party into the stratosphere, you need to lay low, like the good little predatory lion that you are. Say little, observe a lot and wait for the right time to take action.

"
7827,10 july 2016,leo,"No sign of the zodiac has more going on behind the scenes than you, Leo! But this is a good thing. Your birthday season is fast approaching, and it’s time to figure out which opportunities to pounce on. Two amazing aspects today will help you get a handle on both residential/family matters and your career. The cosmos is determined to see that you feel secure in these areas, so consider what needs to be done quietly on your part to bring more balance into your life.

"
7828,11 july 2017,leo,"Your chart indicates that there are people around you who simply can’t be trusted for whatever reason. However, not everyone is an enemy and today you could talk with someone who actually has your own best interests at heart! Pay attention, because some interesting connections could be made this week.

"
7829,11 july 2016,leo,"Be careful with what you say or put in writing, as a tense square between demonstrative Mercury and maverick Uranus means that there could be unexpected repercussions, no matter how innocent your words are. Uranus is in your house of the media and dissemination, indicating that your remarks could reach more people than you intended. Even if you are the target of someone else’s vitriol don’t respond in kind.

"
7830,12 july 2017,leo,"Get your inner shaman on! With the Moon in the groovy, vibey eighth house it’s time to seek wisdom from other realms. Learn how to meditate. Study mindfulness. Create a vision board and focus on it. Sometimes ya just gottta stop using the left side of your brain.

"
7831,12 july 2016,leo,"Meow! Sultry Venus sashays into Leo today, ramping up your charisma and sex appeal. The next three weeks are perfect for jazzing up your image, whether it’s your physique, hair style, wardrobe or makeup. Set those appointments now with the stylist, personal trainer or even the plastic surgeon (Botox, fillers, tummy tucks—these are all in Venus’s area of influence). What a lot of people don’t know is that this golden girl also governs profits, so you’re also in an awesome position to negotiate, push your agenda forward and brainstorm when it comes to business. Gotta love it. And the Sun isn’t even in Leo yet!

"
7832,13 july 2017,leo,"With logical Mercury in your sign, you may be creating to-do lists and strategies. Which is fine–but maybe you need to think a bit more creatively! A Moon-Neptune conjunction helps you in the inspiration department, so don’t just stick to the old tried-and-true.

"
7833,13 july 2016,leo,"Got a message that you’d like to spread to the world, Leo? Then you’re in luck! Motivating Mercury zips into your sign today, helping you walk the walk and talk the talk. Whether it’s a video going viral, a book proposal you’re pitching, a declaration of love you’d like to make or a deal you want to close, you’ve now got the chops to pull it off. With Venus in the same house you have one heck of a tag team.

"
7834,14 july 2017,leo,"It’s not your birthday season quite yet, but energetic little Mercury is already in your sign and is anxious to get the party started. Since this planet is known for its ability to stimulate the mind and all forms of self-expression, your brain should be crackling with good ideas. When Mars rolls into Leo on the 20th, you can swing into action.

"
7835,14 july 2016,leo,"You may be tempted to take a chance on something, but conservative voices in your head are holding you back. Innovative Uranus is sparking your desire to live a little bit bolder, which is a good thing as it will help you grow as an individual. However, make sure that your plans are built on a solid foundation before you charge ahead. A measured risk, one that takes security into consideration, can  be accomplished.

"
7836,15 july 2017,leo,"This can be a wonderfully cathartic day if you allow it to be. Of course, if holding on to negative dramas is what floats your boat, then go ahead and wallow in your misery. But if you want to release the negative kaka and live a life of greater contentment, a cleansing Moon-Uranus aspect will soothe your soul.

"
7837,15 july 2016,leo,"Passion! We have it for so many things– a lover, our kids, a hobby, traveling, our pets, and feeling fit. Today’s Moon-Saturn convo tells you to pursue your passions with abandon. But how many times do we start something we love and not follow though? (Guilty as charged!) Saturn will provide you with the discipline to make it happen.

"
7838,16 july 2017,leo,"Not everyone around you shares your enthusiasm or opinions, and they may not be happy to see you make progress. But they’re in for a rude awakening as you’re moving away from malcontents and into a life that’s going to be a heck of a lot more exciting. Once Mars rolls into Leo next Thursday, the brakes come off.

"
7839,16 july 2016,leo,"Got a presentation to give in the near future? A job interview, a date with a sizzling new prospect or a written piece that showcases your talents? Hell, it doesn’t matter if you’re just going out for drinks with your pals! A smokin’ hot Mercury/Venus hookup makes you the person to pay attention to, Leo. Work it!

"
7840,17 july 2017,leo,"Someone in your personal or business life could be acting in a way that doesn’t sit well with you, but is it really smart to tell them off? This is one of those times when sucking it up may actually be the best strategy. This doesn’t mean that you’re weak; on the contrary, it indicates that you have the wisdom to pick your battles.

"
7841,17 july 2016,leo,"It’s back to school soon for the kids, but the cosmos is encouraging all Leos to do the same. Whether you take a class just for fun or to increase your earning power, today’s aspects indicate that a surprising benefit could arise from attending classes. It’s also a good day to apply for a scholarship or grant. The ancients understood that we need to expand our minds, and they never stopped learning. Neither should you!

"
7842,18 july 2017,leo,"Attention single lions: this is one of the best days of the month to meet someone new, and it could be from an online hunt, a matchmaking pal, or attending a get together. Attached Leos should start spending more time with other couples or join some kind of a group, like a charitable organization, to expand your social contacts.

"
7843,18 july 2016,leo,"It’s not what you do, it’s how  you do it that counts this week. A powerful Moon-Pluto meetup urges you to study your routines, schedules and protocols, both at home and in business. Pluto’s job is to pinpoint the weaknesses in a situation so that they can be fixed. With tomorrow’s full moon in this part of your chart, start evaluating how you can become more productive.

"
7844,19 july 2017,leo,"Buzzy little Mercury is already in your sign, lighting up your mind with new possibilities for the birthday year ahead. Today the messenger planet joins forces with stable Saturn, the planet of long term success. The message here? The projects you initiate now and the people you meet could play a big, happy role in  your future.

"
7845,19 july 2016,leo,"You wouldn’t set off on a journey without a map and a plan, would you? Not to mention having all of the supplies you need on hand. That’s the message of the full moon in Capricorn. This lunation falls in the most detail-oriented part of your chart, telling you to ponder, make lists, and strategize before you bolt forward. Whether it’s planning your wedding, organizing the house or restructuring the work flow at the office, take some time to think things through first. A tense Uranus angle warns that if you just focus on the big picture without considering the grunt work, your project could get derailed.

"
7846,20 july 2017,leo,"OK, let’s get this party started! Your birthday party, that is. The Sun isn’t in your sign yet, but megawatt Mars just rolled in and he’s ready to kick some butt. This coming year could be a major league game changer, thanks to a Leo eclipse coming in a few weeks, so start dreaming about what you’d like to manifest in the months ahead. Nothing, and I mean nothing,  is going to stop you.

"
7847,20 july 2016,leo,"Taking good care of yourself can take many forms, from eating right to exercising to hanging out with uplifting people. A sweet angle between luxe Venus and Saturn, planet of simplicity, tells you to practice more indulgent self-care by adding beauty into your daily life. Fresh flowers, a trip to the museum, a massage–think about ways you can appreciate life more visually and sensually, without breaking the bank!

"
7848,21 july 2017,leo,"A steady theme running through the month of July is that you may be trying to get too much done in too little a period of time. You need to figure out a way to finesse this, Leo. With the Sun about to enter your sign tomorrow you could become even more  motivated and anxious. Don’t forget to have some fun while you’re planning world domination.

"
7849,21 july 2016,leo,"Lucky Jupiter is stationed in your income sector, its first visit to this part of your chart in 13 years. It will be moving on in early September, so now’s the time to plant seeds that will grow into money trees. A positive Jupiter-Moon aspect encourages you to consider a business collaboration as a means to furthering your ambitions. This could also mean retaining an expert, such as a booking agent or stylist. Consider your options.

"
7850,22 july 2017,leo,"Yeah, baby–it’s showtime! The Sun is now in Leo, kicking off your official birthday season. Break out the bubbly and pour yourself a mimosa, as this year will be off the charts compared to years past. That’s because there will be a new moon in your sign on Sunday, then another  one on August 21st–a solar eclipse no less! It doesn’t get any better than this.

"
7851,22 july 2016,leo,"Happy birthday, Leo! Your annual new year begins today as the mighty Sun barrels into your sign. The year ahead will see big changes, as many lions will find new love, go back to school, and become an authority in their field. It will be all about self-promotion, not a problem for your feisty sign! Once Jupiter enters Libra in early September, it’s time to showcase your talents on a much bigger stage than the past.

"
7852,23 july 2017,leo,"Look at you, lucky lion! Today the cosmos delivers the first of TWO new moons in your sign (the next one is on 8-21). Take some time today to create a wish list of things you’d like to manifest in the year ahead. One warning, however: keep it real. Maverick Uranus could spur you to shoot for too many goodies in an unrealistic amount of time.

"
7853,23 july 2016,leo,"A simmering, sizzling Moon-Neptune connection stirs up your passion not only for another, but for life in general! With the Sun now in your sign, it’s time to think about not only the goals you want to achieve, but also the kinds of emotions  you want to experience in the year ahead. Joy? Gratitude? Anticipation? The choice is yours.

"
7854,24 july 2017,leo,"Thanks to so much recent planetary activity in your sign, your brain is coming up with exciting and visionary plans for the future. However, a harsh Venus-Saturn aspect indicates that people around you (friends and lovers, most likely) aren’t supportive. Looks like jealousy is the issue here, so disregard any snarkiness and carry on.

"
7855,24 july 2016,leo,"How high can you fly? A spectacular Moon-Sun trine sets your thoughts about the future soaring. With practical Saturn in your house of creativity, you can come up with visionary ideas that are still grounded in logic.

"
7856,25 july 2017,leo,"Things just keep on getting better for you, lion! The recent new moon highlighted all of the things that you’d like to manifest in the year ahead, and today shrewd Mercury enters your income zone. This may be one of the first areas to focus on, with September being the month for really making things happen financially.

"
7857,25 july 2016,leo,"The recent full moon in Capricorn is pushing you to streamline your errands and work flow. This is a smart move considering that your personal new year has begun, and the more organized you are the easier it will be to achieve goals and have free time for fun. But the Moon in the most footloose part of your chart today rebels against drudgery and routine. That’s OK. Enjoy yourself, because you’ll be back on track tomorrow.

"
7858,26 july 2017,leo,"Faster than a speeding locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound! No, it’s not Superman…it’s Leo! Damn, you’re motivated.

7859,26 july 2016,leo,"The kinds of assignments you handle, as well as the quality of the people you interact with at work, is under review by the cosmos. Fortunately, power broker Pluto is on the case, trying to improve your lot. Today a harmonious tine between Pluto and the Moon could fire you up to raise the bar.

"
7860,27 july 2017,leo,"The path ahead may have seemed unclear, all tangled up with branches and fallen trees that you needed to hack your way through to see clearly. Well, get out your machete, Leo, because the Moon is shining its light on the obstacles that need to be removed. After that it’s full speed ahead.

"
7861,27 july 2016,leo,"Some good news could come your way today about a change that will take you to a higher level in just about any area of your life. That maverick Uranus is shaking things up, challenging the status quo. Doing things the same old way just doesn’t cut it anymore.

An auspicious Moon-Jupiter conjunction helps you strategize, whether you’re trying to land Mr. Right or a new job. Your ability to brainstorm is second to none these days, so seek the advice of others, but remain the final decision maker.

"
7863,28 july 2016,leo,"You’re anxious to get started with new projects, Leo! Not surprising, considering the cluster of planets in your sign, setting your brain abuzz with plans for the future. With the Moon in your house of authority, your confidence level is rising too. But not everyone around you shares your views or agrees with your plans. It may be best to keep them to yourself as you charge forward.

"
7864,29 july 2017,leo,"Someone may be way too opinionated for your taste, but that doesn’t mean that you need to engage in their chatter. You have a lot of good things coming your way, which they may sense. Let ’em stew while you go about your day.

"
7865,29 july 2016,leo,"Back to the future! Tech-savvy, look-ahead Uranus goes retrograde for the next five months in your entrepreneurial ninth house. Which means–slow down, look for weaknesses in a plan, learn new skills and don’t expect overnight success in a product or service launch. All Leos, regardless of employment status, need to focus more on details and not take on too many activities or assignments. Long-distance love affair? Think twice before jumping in!

"
7866,30 july 2017,leo,"You know what you want…so what are you waiting for? Spunky Uranus lights a fire under you to grab that brass ring. Besides, more opportunities will be coming your way that you haven’t even considered. It’s your birthday season, babe–take a great big piece of the cake!

And with rational, long-term Saturn in your creativity sector, your ideas could be fresh, new to the marketplace and quite profitable.

"
7868,31 july 2017,leo,"Now that provocative Venus is in the most secluded part of your chart, you might back away from being showy. Does a beautiful flower fight to get the bees to come its way? Hell no. It just sits there looking gorgeous, waiting for the cosmos to send it admirers. And so should you.

"
7869,31 july 2016,leo,"Someone’s been working way too hard lately, and their paws are dragging as they try to slink forward as a fierce feline. Sound familiar, Leo? It’s time to recharge your batteries, and that doesn’t mean a beer and Netflix. Get thee to the gym, pool, or tennis court and get the blood and oxygen flowing in that body of yours.

Two hot steamin’ trines today will help you toss aside preconceived notions about what you’re capable of, and then take some calculated risks. You’ll be willing to take a chance in love as well as career. A trip to Katmandu? No problem. After you patent that invention that’s been rolling around in your head. Go for it.

"
7872,2 august 2017,leo,"No one loves love–or life!– more than a Leo, and today is a wonderful time to do more of what puts a smile on your face: spending time with your kids or amour, relaxing with a hobby, getting your blood racing with a sport or doing something creative. This isn’t just for today, though; this should become a new, happy habit.

"
7873,2 august 2016,leo,"Pour the Prosecco! The cosmos delivers its annual birthday gift to you: a new moon in Leo. This is like a gift card that you can use to go after any goal or dream of your choosing. You’ll have to put in the effort to be sure, but if you do so your life can look a heck of a lot different by next February. Oh, and by the way–it just so happens that Mars enters your house of romance today too. Shake that shaggy mane and pounce.

"
7874,3 august 2017,leo,"You’re flying high this month, Leo, especially with an upcoming solar eclipse in your sign on the 21st. You may feel as though the sky is the limit, and it is. But planet of genius, Uranus, retrogrades today for five months, which means that you have to avoid biting off more than you can chew. Focus on a few key goals and develop momentum with them first.

"
7875,3 august 2016,leo,"Motivation and a zest for living start to gain momentum, thanks to the new moon in Leo yesterday. Over the next two weeks you will feel more creative and in control. Looking for recognition? Then get your name, resume, talents and hot little body out there for the world to see!

"
7876,4 august 2017,leo,"You’re not the type that likes to be told that they can’t do something—RAWR!!—but planetary aspects indicate that you need to you need to slow your roll. It appears that you’re being overly optimistic about what can be done in a certain amount of time, and if you don’t take a time out things might start to fall apart. Rome wasn’t built in a day, Leo.

"
7877,4 august 2016,leo,"Now that the Moon is in Virgo and Venus heads there tomorrow, it’s time to develop some sound routines and strategies that will help you earn more. A solar eclipse takes place on September 1st in your earnings sector; be ready for it.

"
7878,5 august 2017,leo,"Are you bringing sexy back? Where the hell did it go? A spunky Neptune-Sun aspect tells you to get in touch with your steamy, sultry side. Don’t be so focused on chasing after your dreams that you forget how to live a luscious life.

"
7879,5 august 2016,leo,"Oh, yeah. The planet of profits goes into your income sector today. Between  now and the 29th you have an amazing opportunity to show your worth to the boss, clients, a prospective employer, an agent or the marketplace. But nothing will happen if you sit on your duff. Work it! With Venus by your side, people will pay attention.

"
7880,6 august 2017,leo,"They say that habits make the man (or the woman), and from your chart it appears that yours could use an upgrade. No matter how impatient you may currently be to get something done or achieve a particular status, it’s not going to happen unless you start handling time management and your routines better.

"
7881,6 august 2016,leo,"Just how willing are you to put yourself out there? Are you willing to take a risk in love? Quit the day job to pursue an entrepreneurial passion? Push your creative talents to an even higher level, one that you didn’t even think was possible? These kinds of questions will be on your mind today as two planets in security-conscious Virgo square off against two others in adventurous Sagittarius. When Saturn goes direct on the 13th the path will become clear.

"
7882,7 august 2017,leo,"Should I stay or should I go? The lunar eclipse in Aquarius poses that question to you. Whether it’s a romantic relationship or a business related one, it’s time to make an executive decision. Chances are you’ll be darn interested in looking out for #1 with assertive Mars close to the Sun.

"
7883,7 august 2016,leo,"Hold on to the plastic, Leo, and be discerning when it comes to spending and investing your hard-earned money. A demanding Mercury-Neptune opposition could tempt you to spend money that you don’t have, or to invest in a questionable venture. Right now it’s all about building a strong financial base. Focus on earning more and investing it wisely.

"
7884,8 august 2017,leo,"Uranus is known as the planet of genius and innovation, and today this bad boy is acting up–in a good way! It can change the way you view a key relationship, encourage you to form an alliance with someone, or plant an idea in your head that can take you far. The key right now is that other people can and will play a big part in your future happiness and success.

"
7885,8 august 2016,leo,"It’s critical to remain objective and rational when it comes to money matters and your big financial goals. Spontaneous Uranus is sparking your desire to go after something sensational–a business startup, quitting the day job, patenting an invention, going global–but other planets are warning you to keep it real. This doesn’t mean that your ideas won’t work. Rather, you need to pay more attention to the process: daily routines, sticking to a budget, maintaining a level of security.

"
7886,9 august 2017,leo,"With the Sun in your sign and an upcoming eclipse, this is one of the most transformative times for you ever. Today chief inspector Pluto asks you to analyze your methods of getting things done, otherwise known as efficiency! You’d be wise to adjust any habits that are lacking, as things are about to take off in a big way.

"
7887,9 august 2016,leo,"Resourcefulness is one of your fine qualities, Leo, but lately you may be coming up short when it comes to assets. Assets like time, money, credit, the right contacts, maybe even support from the people closest to you. As a result, you may have been playing it safe when taking a look at future plans. But today’s Moon-Venus connection bodes well for strengthening your asset base.

"
7888,10 august 2017,leo,"Your self image and the manner in which you express yourself are key, and the planets are telling you to buff them up. This isn’t just about a new haircut or clothes; it also includes an attitude alignment. Which ought to be easy to pull off, thank you very much, considering that gentle Venus is in your house of the subconscious mind, working her magic.

"
7889,10 august 2016,leo,"New opportunities to boost your income are in today’s stars, as planet of negotiation Mercury forms a perfect angle with transformative Pluto. It could be a raise, new job, new client or an additional earnings stream. Mercury will be actively helping you increase your bottom line, but in order to reap the rewards you have to get your name out there.

"
7890,11 august 2017,leo,"Express yourself! A fabulous Sun-Jupiter link enables you to get your ideas and thoughts out there to the people who count. Between now and October 10th you should be brainstorming, strategizing and promoting yourself aggressively.

"
7891,11 august 2016,leo,"A smart plan for making more money could use a little tweaking, and inspiration could come upon you suddenly. With the Moon swinging past Mars and Saturn, taking a more creative approach is the best way to go. You have a lot of talent, but with Saturn in retrograde motion, you haven’t tapped in to your creativity as best as you could. That’s going to change this weekend when Saturn goes direct.

"
7892,12 august 2017,leo,"Don’t count your chickens before they hatch! Mercury retrogrades in your earnings sector, slowing down job offers, promotions and signing new clients. Entrepreneurs will find that new strategies will take more time than expected. No problem, however. With a solar eclipse arriving in Leo on the 21st, a few delays aren’t going to stop the mighty lion.

"
7893,12 august 2016,leo,"Get ready to rumble! The past five months may have been fraught with delays or snags, especially in matters of the heart and business. That’s because mighty Saturn has been retrograde, forcing you to reevaluate your romantic prospects as well as your skill level at work. But the retrospection is about to pay off–Saturn resumes direct motion manana.

"
7894,13 august 2017,leo,"It’s no secret that you’re the celestial favorite these days, with the Sun and Mars in your sign and an upcoming eclipse too. But the good news just keeps on getting better for you as the mighty Sun trines Saturn today, a superb aspect that adds a dash of romance and creativity to your life. Set long term plans in motion in all areas of your life. Just make sure that they include as much fun and new experiences as possible!

"
7895,13 august 2016,leo,"Get in touch with your artistic mojo, Leo! It’s an off-the-charts day for creative projects. Saturn goes direct in your house of talent, enabling you to impress others with your ideas and skills. With the Moon, Sun and Uranus forming a perfect triangle in the sky, you could end up seeing your work hitting the big time in the months ahead. Just don’t expect the money to come pouring in right away, as Jupiter’s in a tough spot. Slow and steady will win this race.

"
7896,14 august 2017,leo,"Great day for some soul searching when it comes to your career and other key goals. Your intuition and creativity will be high, so use them to help distill your plethora of ideas into a few winners. The best time to launch them? At the solar eclipse in Leo next Monday.

"
7897,14 august 2016,leo,"You’re ready to break out of an old self-image, Leo, and today inspirational Uranus gives you the kick in the pants you need.  With Mars and Saturn in your house of the arts, it’s time to start living a more authentic, creative lifestyle. Pluto, the great transformer, will help you rebuild a happening new existence from the ground up.

"
7898,15 august 2017,leo,"Snap out of it! Stop feeling sorry for yourself or being resentful about what other people have done. Pluto in your uber-practical sixth house tells you to focus on your own life. Enough of the hand wringing and self-indulgent psychoanalysis.

"
7899,15 august 2016,leo,"It’s an amazing day for launching a new endeavor! First, the fiery Sun in your sign forms a trine (the best angle possible) with stimulating Uranus, the planet of genius. Then the Moon shakes hands with Pluto in your work and productivity sector, saying, “Yeah….we can do this!” By the way, Pluto doesn’t like doing things the same old way, and neither does Uranus. It’s time for a new MO.

"
7900,16 august 2017,leo,"Your motivation rises today as aggressive Mars is in a feisty mood! It’s time to rewrite your goals and plans, and that includes love and money. This is no time to be sentimental. Keep it real and go for it.

"
7901,16 august 2016,leo,"Thinking about going global–or viral? If gaining more press, market share, or contracts is on your agenda, then you’re in luck. The authoritative Sun in your sign is shaking hands in a serious meeting with innovative Uranus in your house of broad horizons. With the full moon later this week falling in your house of partnerships, you may end up in a profitable collaboration with an interested party.

"
7902,17 august 2017,leo,"Both your intuition and logical mind are strong these days, which is usually  a wonderful thing—until they start sending conflicting messages. The issue at hand is that you have many options ahead of you, various paths to take, and you can see the advantages and drawbacks of both. The air will clear within the next 48 hours, so wait a bit before making decisions.

"
7903,17 august 2016,leo,"It’s time to feng shui your work routines, Leo, whether they’re at the office or at home. A super Venus-Pluto trine in your efficiency area urges you to try new tricks and hacks that will simplify and streamline your daily life, and then turn these into habits. The upside? Profitable Venus is in your earnings sector, promising that if you do the grunt work you’ll end up with more money in your pocket.

With the passionate Moon conjuncting Venus, consider what you’d really like to manifest in the year ahead–then get ready for showtime!

"
7905,18 august 2016,leo,"A sparkling full moon in Aquarius sets the stage for you to enter into an adventurous new phase when it comes to collaborating with others. Whether it’s in love or business, your aspects for meeting someone who will want a partnership with you are excellent. Will this mean parting company with someone else? Possibly, especially if financial problems were cutting into the alliance. Strong relationships, however, will carry on, and with more optimism and spontaneity.

"
7906,19 august 2017,leo,"To thine own self be true! Don’t let the (unsolicited) opinions of others dissuade you from pursuing your heart’s desire. Furthermore, don’t allow your own fears to hold you back either. You’re the mighty lion, and nothing is going to get in your way.

"
7907,19 august 2016,leo,"Just how hard do you want to work? 60 hours a week? 80? Please! A Moon-Neptune conjunction tells you to work smarter, not harder. Whereas a four-hour workweek may be the stuff of fantasy (I’m talking to you, Tim Ferriss) it would be wise to consider ways to get better financial results without putting in so much time. Lions need to luxuriate, you know.

"
7908,20 august 2016,leo,"Telling a Leo to not splurge on a luxury item is like telling a bird not to fly…..but so it is! Lock up the credit cards for the next week, as a number of celestial orbs in your finance sector might make you feel more flush than you really are. That being said, when the Sun enters Virgo on Monday your income could get a big boost in September. Just make sure to earn it before you start spending it.

"
7909,21 august 2016,leo,"You may feel anxious to get moving with plans, especially if they’re on the fun and creative side. But the planets are telling you that first you need to develop a ritual or protocol and stick with it in order to succeed. You may feel that doing so will curtail your artistic expression or make fun seem too structures, but if you don’t have a blueprint things will fall apart.

"
7910,22 august 2016,leo,"You’re entering into one of the most profitable years in over a decade, Leo, and the key will be promotion: how you market and sell your skills, ideas, and reputation. Today the mighty Sun powers into Virgo, your second house of earnings, where it will stay for a month. Blessing this action is a positive meeting between generous Jupiter and intelligent Mercury.This is no time to hide your light under a bushel. Got ideas? Work ’em.

"
7911,23 august 2016,leo,"I think I can, I think I can! The freight train known as Leo keeps chugging forward, and today’s aspects provide a dose of inspiration to keep that momentum going. A strong Moon-Pluto-Venus triangle in the heavens recommends that you change the way you go about doing things, especially in your career. The profits are out there; however, a more creative or innovative approach is needed to snag them.

"
7912,24 august 2016,leo,"Stop, start, stop, start! Has that been a recurring theme in your life lately? You may especially be feeling this in matters of the heart. Love can be heating up, but your rational mind tells you to slow down. You want to spend quality time with the kids, but then a responsibility pulls you away. You delve into a hobby or creative project, only to neglect it for awhile. You’re not a disorganized mess: Mars and Saturn are sending mixed signals. But Saturn’s gonna win this battle, so slow down and start to appreciate life more.

"
7913,25 august 2016,leo,"Leos are known as the most artistic of all the signs, and they can tap into their creative mojo whether they work as an accountant, stay-at-home Mom, or a graphic designer. Yesterday’s awesome Mars-Saturn meet up was designed to help you mine the depths of that talent. However, an opposition from the Moon today could create doubts in your mind, as a friend or colleague might question how you go about things. The doubts could also be coming from your subconscious mind (“will this really work out?”). Yes it will, and next week’s solar eclipse will point that out to you.

"
7914,26 august 2016,leo,"Despite the fact that energetic Mars and Saturn are working hard to take your ideas to the next level, they’re still not ready for prime time. That’s OK, though–disciplined, logical Saturn will be by your side for yet another year. It’s Mars that’s making you antsy to see results, and today the fiery planet gets a bucket of Neptunian water dumped on him. More time, thought and perhaps even more money is needed to turn them into reality.

"
7915,27 august 2016,leo,"Ready to live the luxe life? Of course you are–you’re a Leo! And you’re going to love today’s Jupiter-Venus conjunction, a powerful meeting in the heavens in which these two will be discussing your lifestyle. You’ve got to make it to spend it, and as Venus and Jupiter are both in your house of income–and both  govern profits–you’re in a sweet spot. However, don’t run off to Neiman Marcus just yet: Mercury will be retrograding here next week, urging you to be budget-conscious. Focus on making the green stuff for now.

"
7916,28 august 2016,leo,"It’s an interesting day in which you may have one of those “Eureka!” moments, Leo. You may suddenly find that your mind is rejecting a certain philosophy, idea or even a spiritual principle that you had held dear. This could be due to a sparkling trine between the Moon and Chiron, the wounded healer. It’s time to release old, outworn ideas that are no longer serving you.

"
7917,29 august 2016,leo,"With Venus moving into your house of brainstorming, negotiating and discussions, you’ll be more than ready to communicate with others, whether it’s family, a lover or a business contact. But Mercury retrogrades tomorrow in your income sector, indicating that you’ll need to be budget-conscious in any project you decide to undertake. Make sure that everyone in your world is on the same page about finances.

"
7918,30 august 2016,leo,"Your personal and business finances will be under the microscope in the weeks and months ahead, but this is a good  thing. A positive solar eclipse on Thursday could usher in a new job with a pay raise, clients with deep pockets or even a change in occupation. But with Mercury going retrograde today in your income sector, you need to get real about spending and saving the green stuff. Set aside time to analyze where the money goes every month–and brainstorm ways to earn more.

"
7919,31 august 2016,leo,"Despite Mercury having gone retrograde in your earnings sector, asking that you budget and be careful with expenditures, your spirit isn’t sinking. Au contraire–a zesty Uranus-Moon meetup is encouraging you to dream up ways to earn more! And this is the smart way to finesse Mercury retrograde, as this is the planet of intelligence and strategizing. Think long-term and consider all of your new options.

"
7920,1 september 2016,leo,"Ka-ching! Love that sound, and it’s a sound you’ll be hearing more of in the months ahead. A smokin’ solar eclipse in your income sector helps you ratchet up your earnings, which could mean a new job or a raise is coming your way. But the cosmos isn’t the cavalry riding in to drop dinero in your lap. You have to make some effort, so if your wallet is not as hefty as you’d like, begin brainstorming. If that means starting a business on the side or taking an existing company to a much higher level, so be it. Green lights ahead.

"
7921,2 september 2016,leo,"Feel like you’re in a financial or romantic rut? It’s possible with a T-square in the heavens, pulling at you from all directions. Part of the problem seems to stem from a need to have security, whether it’s staying in a job, career, or relationship that isn’t satisfying. Or perhaps you simply can’t find the time to balance your need for down time, romance and intimacy. However, a happy meeting between Jupiter and Mercury indicates that you’ll find the enjoyment you want–and the security you crave.

"
7922,3 september 2016,leo,"Yes, it’s a Saturday. Yes, it’s a holiday weekend in the US. And yes, you’re a fun-loving Leo looking to enjoy some down time. But that’s not stopping the Moon from swinging past your productive house of making mo’ money. Don’t worry, no one is telling you to actually do some work and go into the office. Instead, pay attention to any bright ideas that stream into that feline head of yours. They could end up being money in the bank.

"
7923,4 september 2016,leo,"Finding both the time and money to enjoy life may be a source of frustration these days, Leo. Vacations, dinners out, concert tickets–they’re all calling your name, not to mention chic new clothes and some spiffy home furnishings. Conquer the desire to spend, as a pending Saturn-Neptune square warns you to be more conservative with your cash. This doesn’t mean that you’re not going to have any fun, however. With Jupiter just about to enter your highly social third house, you’ll be living it up–just closer to home.

"
7924,5 september 2016,leo,"Within days, Leo, you’re going to be a walking idea factory. Of all the signs of the zodiac, lions will be the ones with the most brainstorms and creative juices flowing. And this isn’t just a two-day or three-week gig: hell, no, we’re talking about the next year.  And while some of these sparks of genius can end up being quite profitable, today’s aspects warn that you need to give them time to manifest.

"
7925,6 september 2016,leo,"Looking to increase your net worth? Then today is a good time to brainstorm. Passive investments, such as rental real estate, or running a business on the side while you work a day job are highly favored by the cosmos. With the Moon making a fabulous aspect to inspirational Neptune, you should be able to come up with some sizzling ideas. As the week progresses you can start to flesh them out.

"
7926,7 september 2016,leo,"Yeah, baby! It’s time for a certain lion to strut their stuff (which is never a stretch for your regal sign!). A potent Sun-Pluto trine helps put you in the driver’s seat when it comes to your career. Pluto has ben retrograding in the part of your chart that governs what you do for a living and how you go about getting things done. No doubt you’ve been introspective and have developed some new ideas and habits. Well, they’re about to pay off. Step out of the shadows and into the light. Take on the mantle of a leader.

"
7927,8 september 2016,leo,"Creative Leos will reach new heights of creativity today as the Moon helps you dig deep into your well of talent. La Luna connects with both ambitious Mars and disciplined Saturn in your house of artistic ability. With profitable Venus in a happy angle, you should be considering how to promote your skills and portfolio. It’s also a super day for romance: meeting a new person in the neighborhood, or making plans with your amour to get out there and enjoy life.

7928,9 september 2016,leo,"For the past year, abundant Jupiter graced your income sector. If you used this time wisely, planting seeds for a higher paying job or a booming business, now’s the time to nurture the seedlings. This is your best year in over a decade for self-promotion, writing, teaching, hitting the lecture circuit, crushing it on social media, and landing interviews. It can also be a highly social time in which you’re mingling with friends and neighbors, enjoying the company of fresh new faces. Any problems in the past with siblings or cousins should be laid to rest. And short-distance travel is favored, so start planning some fun three-day weekends.

"
7929,10 september 2016,leo,"Oy vey. Leo, what’s going on in that head of yours? Neptune is stirring up some pretty deep thoughts and emotions, making them rise to the surface of your consciousness. You want to process them and let them go. But then stern Saturn gets on your case for ruminating and maybe even wallowing in self-pity or drama. Fortunately Jupiter just went into your house of intelligence and communication yesterday. You’ll be able to figure this out, don’t worry.

"
7930,11 september 2016,leo,"As much as you may feel like socializing, power broker Pluto is telling you to get down to business. You have an exciting year ahead now that Jupiter is in your third house of mingling and communication, but before you start hobnobbing you need to get caught up on some grunt work at home or at the office.

"
7931,12 september 2016,leo,"Intelligent Mercury is hell bent on bringing you mo’ money, and it could be coming your way in the form of a new job, raise, or a client with deep pockets. But the messenger planet is retrograde, which means that you need to be careful while discussing dinero with others. Mars is in a difficult spot, possibly creating intense negotiations. Artists and creatives: don’t undersell your work!

"
7932,13 september 2016,leo,"The luxe life may beckon, but honey, the bills gotta be paid. Mars is blazing a path through the part of your chart that governs the fun stuff in life. However, today it squares the authoritative Sun in your savings sector. Does this mean that you’ll be spending the next six months eating ramen noodles at home? Hell, no. But it does  mean that you need to exert more discipline when it comes to your finances.

"
7933,14 september 2016,leo,"Attention Leo artists and creatives: consider partnering with someone, or hiring an expert to represent your talents. Sweet angles between the Moon, Uranus and Mars are perfect for lining up a posse of experts that can take your talents to a higher level. The same holds true for employees and business owners, who should be taking a more innovative approach to success.

"
7934,15 september 2016,leo,"With the passionate Moon hooking up with amorous Neptune today in your house of intimacy and bonding, chances are your thoughts are turning to love and what you need from a partner. Whether you’re single or attached it’s important to consider these factors, as there is a lot of planetary activity in your romance sector. Lusty Mars winks at Uranus, telling you to live a sexier, more adventurous life. Don’t settle for Mr. or Ms. Dull & Boring.

"
7935,16 september 2016,leo,"Love and money, always a potent mix. Today a lunar eclipse in Pisces highlights both areas of your life, specifically intimacy, deep emotions and your sex life, as well as the strength of your financial portfolio. A business venture that you’ve been working on may finally bear fruit, as all of the right pieces come together. Investors may want to loan you money, loans could be paid back, or a windfall could arrive from a non-business source. You could also make a decision rather suddenly about your love life, such as ending a less than stellar relationship, or popping the question to the Right One. As one door closes, another one opens for you both in romance and financial opportunity.

"
7936,17 september 2016,leo,"Adventure is calling your name, Leo! A dazzling Mars-Uranus trine could spark a spontaneous desire within to do something that’s outside your usual routine or repertoire: dating a different type, trying out a new exotic cuisine, planning a vacation on the road less traveled, or trying your hand at a hobby or sport. Creatives, this day is perfect for pushing your talents to the next level, so head to the studio and hunker down.

"
7937,18 september 2016,leo,"It’s time to bust out of an old groove that is getting tired, maybe even boring. You may have been so focused on getting things done around the house and at the office that you’ve forgotten something important: there’s a great big world out there, and it’s calling your name! This realization could hit you quite suddenly–and strongly. Pay attention.

"
7938,19 september 2016,leo,"Stay local or go global? Operate at a snails’s pace, or go viral? That’s the question the stars have for you today, Leo, as Venus and Uranus square off in the heavens. Uranus can light a fire under our tushies pretty quickly, so don’t be surprised if you get a sudden urge to expand way  past your current circumstances.

"
7939,20 september 2016,leo,"Mercury has been retrograde in your income sector for the past few weeks, encouraging you to rethink your earning, saving and spending strategies. Today it forms a magnificent trine with transformative Pluto. One thing’s for certain: you should be considering new ways to get ahead financially. This trine will reoccur on Friday, so spend some time this week formulating a plan.

"
7940,22 september 2016,leo,"The lion roars! Start warming up your vocal cords, Leo. And your fingers and brain. The authoritative Sun enters Libra today, which is your third house of communication. Writing, negotiating, drawing, lecturing, teaching, blogging, chatting—all of these activities are highly favored over the next year thanks to Jupiter’s presence in this part of your chart. But now with the Sun there too, you’ll be unstoppable.

"
7941,23 september 2016,leo,"A tug of war between intuition and logic may occur as your higher mind picks up information from the cosmos. The problem is that your logical mind may be in happy-happy land, whereas your intuition is highly focused. If you sense something is off, it probably is.

"
7942,24 september 2016,leo,"You’re in a good spot to earn more as a profitable Mercury-Pluto trine occurs in the heavens. You could land a new client, develop a fresh product line, add a needed service to your company or impress the boss with your efficiency. But the Moon may find you doubting yourself. Don’t go there—you’re on the right track!

"
7943,25 september 2016,leo,"A lion can quietly sit by the sidelines for hours, even days, surveying the scene while they’re waiting to pounce. With the Moon now in your sign and a magnificent Sun-Jupiter conjunction tomorrow, get ready to spring into action. Your days of not being heard are over as lines of communication open up wide. Writing, blogging, pitching ideas, engaging in sweet talk, socializing and even teaching could be a big part of your life in the year ahead.

"
7944,26 september 2016,leo,"Time to roar, Leo! A smokin’ hot aspect between the Sun and Jupiter puts you in the spotlight, especially when it comes to self-expression. There has never been a better time to communicate your ideas, whether that means via the arts or writing, lecturing, socializing or marketing. With the Moon in your sign forming a trine with Saturn, whatever you initiate now will have long-term  impact. Shameless self-promotion is the name of the game!

"
7945,27 september 2017,leo,"Watch out world. Leos are on the loose, and you’ll be able to see them burning up a path on the jogging trail or the treadmill at the gym. Mars has just entered their sixth house of fitness and vitality for the first time in two years. Oh, and you might want to get out of their way at the office or in the kitchen too, as they’re hell-bent on becoming more efficient. They might find that others are getting annoyed with their can-do attitude, but that’s too bad. Somebody’s gotta lead the pack.

"
7946,28 september 2016,leo,"You can make a lot of progress when it comes to setting productive new habits in place, things that will make life simpler while perhaps even adding to your wealth. Creating a budget is well aspected, along with planning for retirement or another big expense such as buying a house or paying for your kids’ college educations. But Neptune is in a tense angle, indicating that you need to be realistic in your planning.

"
7947,29 september 2016,leo,"Don’t let your emotions get the better of you, especially when it comes to money matters or concerns about your personal security or self-esteem. Someone may spout an opinion that gets under your skin, and you may not see it coming. Count to ten and breathe as this too shall pass.

"
7948,30 september 2016,leo,"Excellent day to speak your mind! The emotional Moon meets up with optimistic Jupiter, encouraging you to express yourself, which can also include the graphic arts, writing, or just plain socializing. However, be mindful when it comes to dealing with your kids or a lover as a tough Saturn-Neptune angle may be clouding your vision. They may need boundaries—today’s a good day to set them.

"
7949,1 october 2016,leo,"Don’t hold back! The next six months to a year is the most auspicious time in over a decade to self-promote, courtesy of a new moon today in your chatty third house. Write, blog, prospect, advertise, teach, lecture, draw, use social media, create a demo tape, polish up your portfolio or resume—do whatever it takes to get your message out there. With Venus and Neptune forming a harmonious trine, your prospects for financial success are awesome. Home-based businesses should do well also. But it won’t be all about working your connections: this can be a highly social time too in which you can mix and mingle with a lot of fun people.

"
7950,2 october 2016,leo,"Your brain should be buzzing with ideas and projects you want to pursue, but where should you start? Venus in your comfort sector may find you questioning just how far you want to go with certain initiatives. Quitting the day job, for example, to run off and sell pina coladas on an island beach somewhere might sound enticing, but a lion needs a den and three solid meals a day.  Give yourself time to make the right decisions.

"
7951,3 october 2016,leo,"You may be feeling restless, even edgy, as the Moon is in your house of emotions and Jupiter has your brain going at warp speed. If there was ever a week (or month) to start meditating or beginning a practice of mindfulness, Leo, this is it! The cosmos is blessing you with brainstorms–the problem is that you can only process so much at a time. Sl-o-o-o-w down.

"
7952,4 october 2016,leo,"Honey, if you have a bright idea, now’s the time to buckle down and get working on it. With red-hot Mars in your house of efficiency and the illuminating Sun in your self-expression sector, strike while the iron is hot! The Sun makes a terrific angle to disciplined Saturn too, indicating that whatever you work on can be successful far into the future. The key is to schedule time every day to work on whatever it is your brain is cooking up.

"
7953,5 october 2016,leo,"Terrific day to take control of your work flow and get caught up on errands. If you’re overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tasks that need to be done, here’s a great book to read: Getting Things Done by David Allen. He has a simple yet super-productive technique for getting on top of your tasks so that you are in control rather than the tasks controlling you. You’ll need to be organized, as planetary activity in your self-expression zone is hurling ideas at you left and right.

"
7954,6 october 2016,leo,"Here’s the good news: your energy level is rising, especially when it comes to self-expression—talking, writing, drawing, socializing, teaching. And so is your creativity! But a tough angle today between Mars and Jupiter indicates that you may be pushing too hard, running the risk of revealing too much or trying to complete something in too hurried a fashion. The key between now and the middle of October is to pace yourself and pay attention to the finer points.

"
7955,7 october 2016,leo,"Ah, the downside of being a regal creature—dealing with the jealousy from the “common people”. Hope you’re used to dealing with envy, because you could be at the receiving end of it over the next two weeks! The problem? The Sun and lucky Jupiter have been active in your house of self-expression, making you the guy or gal with the bright ideas, the killer portfolio, and the sauciest catwalk. Today Mercury joins them, which will quicken your thoughts, making you even more productive and charismatic. The haters will primarily come from the office or the gym, so watch out for power plays and childish behavior coming from their direction.

"
7956,8 october 2016,leo,"Oh, yeah. The weekend is here and it’s time for….partying? Binge watching some Netflix? Shopping for swag? Sorry, Leo. How about balancing your checkbook, organizing your closets and coming up with a game plan for getting your work done. The crazy thing is, you are actually going to be in the mood for this, courtesy of Neptune inspiring you to become more efficient and streamlined. Cut loose next weekend with the Aries full moon.

"
7957,9 october 2016,leo,"Leos are acting more like Virgos these days–getting organized, streamlining their work flow at home and the office, balancing their checkbooks and maybe even hitting the gym. A super Moon-Mars-Pluto aspect is responsible for this, and it’s necessary. You need to get your “house” in order before you tackle the next big plan, otherwise you’ll be dealing with a house of cards.

"
7958,10 october 2016,leo,"With the Moon in a helpful angle from your partnership zone, this is a good day to communicate your thoughts and needs to someone close. It’s possible that someone may contact you about entering into a business alliance, something to consider. Your brain is popping with so many ideas that you may not be able to execute all of them by yourself.

"
7959,11 october 2016,leo,"Hey there, Einstein! Leos are looking like the smartest thing on two legs with a powerful meeting between sharp-as-a-tack Mercury and optimistic, abundant Jupiter. It doesn’t get much better than this for brainstorming. With red hot Mars in your efficiency zone in good angle to inspirational Neptune, today’s cosmic energy is amazing for dreaming and then doing.

"
7960,12 october 2016,leo,"It’s time for the fearless lion to go into one of your famous “naps”. You know, the kind when it looks like you’re lounging but you’re really planning your next strike. Silence is the word o’ the day—and the next week, actually—as tense angles could create pushback from people at the office, whether they’re colleagues or clients. No matter how diplomatic you  may be, it won’t matter, so the best bet is to just chill and wait for this to pass.

"
7961,13 october 2016,leo,"Steer clear of divas and trolls over the next few days as chatty Mercury squares off against Mars. The less you say the better, as people around you may be looking for a drama or a fight. You have so much energy these days encouraging you to move ahead, whether it’s with a diet and exercise regimen or a work assignment. Channel your drive into these activities and ignore the malcontents.

"
7962,14 october 2016,leo,"Leos like the good life and today a happy meeting between Mercury and Saturn will help you live more creatively: enjoying delicious cuisine, fine wines, shopping for a sassier wardrobe and filling your lair with plush decor. But you also need to carve out time for hobbies and other pursuits that make your heart sing, easy to do with Saturn by your side. Make this a non-negotiable.

"
7963,15 october 2016,leo,"A project that you’re working on may need to go back to the drawing board for revisions, Leo. Whether it’s your thesis, redecorating the bedroom, a marketing plan or a vacation agenda, the planets are erratic today. A decision maker may make demands; a service provider could slack or refuse to do their share of the work; a sudden change of venues or activities could occur; or a colleague is acting like the Queen Bee. Don’t sweat it, because in the long run the things you’re putting effort into will pay off handsomely.

"
7964,16 october 2016,leo,"Big plans get a burst of wind beneath their wings with tonight’s full moon in Aries! Of all the signs, Leo, you are an idea factory these days, and something you’ve been working on could come to a happy conclusion or turning point this week. But keep your eyes open for a sudden switcheroo or obstacle that may seem to come from nowhere, as erratic Uranus may throw a monkey wrench into the works. It’s essential to have everything you present to the world to be in tiptop shape: presentations, papers, contracts, social media posts, e-mails and even your spoken words. No, Mercury’s not retrograde, but the Sun is demanding perfection before your plans really take off.

"
7965,17 october 2016,leo,"Inspiration could strike big time when it comes to one of your most closely held dreams or goals. The moon forms a spectacular trine with metamorphic Pluto, so don’t be surprised if you begin to rethink or tweak an ambition. This is especially true when it comes to your health, diet and fitness, as well as work assignments you’ve been handling. A megawatt Mars-Pluto conjunction on Wednesday in this part of the chart will add rocket boosters to your plans.

"
7966,18 october 2016,leo,"A match made in the heavens: luxe Venus enters your house of fashion, beauty, dining out, having fun…and did I mention romance? No one knows how to live the good life better than a Leo, so you should be in your element over the next three weeks. Take some time away from being a brainiac to nurture your sensual, creative side.

"
7967,19 october 2016,leo,"It’s not what you know—it’s how you apply  what you know that counts, Leo. And that message will be drilled into your brain today as the two most dynamic planets in the solar system, Pluto and Mars, hold a serious conversation in the heavens. It’s time to stop dreaming and put an end to incessant strategizing, and to take action on whatever it is that’s important to you: losing weight, buying a house, organizing your files, getting fit and healthy, prospecting more, finding new love, or starting a business. These two orbs are going to light a major fire under your tush to get going, and in the process they may bring some powerful decision makers your way.

"
7968,20 october 2016,leo,"Someone could express a opinion today that goes totally against your ideas or a plan that you’re working on. The opposition may even catch you off guard, and you may be tempted to protect your “territory”. But why bother? You can’t expect everyone to go along with your genius ideas. Keep doing what you’re doing: you’re on the right track.

"
7969,21 october 2016,leo,"Your intuition could be working overtime today with the vibey Moon in the house of the subconscious mind. Likewise, La Luna could raise your sensitivity level to the moronic behavior and remarks of others. Sometimes ya just gotta rise above it, and today’s that kind of a day. But you might also realize that you can remain above it forever  if you choose.

"
7970,22 october 2016,leo,"It’s time to feather the nest! The Sun is now in your domestic sector, opening up a four-week window of time in which you can remodel, redecorate and organize your closets and drawers. Thinking of moving? This is the perfect time to look for a new place, especially with a new moon occurring in this part of the sky on the 30th. This sector also governs your overall sense of comfort and security, not surprising since we tend to feel nourished and safe in our home base. If there are any negative emotions or dramas that have been holding you back from enjoying life, it’s time to release them, especially if they are related to past and present family issues.

"
7971,23 october 2016,leo,"You’re going to need to open up the lines of communication early this week, especially when it comes to financial and romantic matters. A helpful Jupiter-Neptune aspect today is designed to help clear the air and get down to the nitty gritty; no LaLa Land thinking allowed! Otherwise you could fall prey to someone’s BS on Tuesday. Keep it real.

"
7972,24 october 2016,leo,"How confident and secure are you? Well, with Mercury entering the part of the sky that governs these states of mind, you ought to be feeling a heck of a lot better. It doesn’t matter if you chat with a friend, schedule a session with a therapist or just work things out by taking a long walk alone in the woods, your ability to find greater comfort and serenity is now heightened.

"
7973,25 october 2016,leo,"The say that flattery will get you everywhere, but is that really true? Smart people can see through insincere compliments. Make sure that you’re not dishing out any happy horses*** today, and if you’re at the receiving end of it, the best choice of action is to ignore it. This may be more difficult, however, if it’s coming from a lover or admirer. Stay on your toes.

"
7974,26 october 2016,leo,"Perfect day to talk things over with a lover or child with a healing Jupiter-Venus aspect. With lucky and optimistic Jupiter in your communication sector, you should be able to make points, uncover problems and make progress without a lot of drama, threats and screaming. It’s also a promising day for creatives to self-promote and develop their talents even further. All Leos should consider taking a class just for the fun of it and spending more time on hobbies.

"
7975,27 october 2016,leo,"Does a family or housing issue have your knickers in a twist? Then get it resolved, pronto. Today’s the day to do so with a magnificent Sun-Mercury conjunction. Talk to a parent, sibling or in-law about a drama that has gone on for far too long; call a real estate agent about listing your house or finding a new place to rent; work things out with a roommate; hire a contractor to fix the leaky roof. You may also find that this is a good time to become more emotionally centered, especially when it comes to releasing past issues that may stem from your childhood. Let ‘em go.

"
7976,28 october 2016,leo,"A silver tongue! That’s what you possess today, Leo. This is the perfect time to express yourself with a meeting of the passionate Moon and generous Jupiter. With Mars forming a terrific angle with Chiron, the wounded healer, you can make amends with a lover or patch up differences with a child. But it’s also an auspicious time to ask someone out on a date, drum up venture capital or present your art portfolio to an agent or gallery.

"
7977,29 october 2016,leo,"How realistic are you being about love these days, Leo? And for that matter, about kids too—conceiving them, raising them and dealing with their problems? Today’s a “tough love” day in the heavens as nurturing Venus meets up with disciplinarian Saturn. You may need to set boundaries with a lover or with children as it seems that things may be getting out of hand. Creative lions, you may need to scale back plans a bit and become more focused on logging in the hours to perfect your craft before showcasing your talent.

"
7978,30 october 2016,leo,"A lion needs a lush lair, and the planets are telling you to create a home environment that makes you want to purr. Today’s new moon in Scorpio suggests that it’s time for some redecorating, organizing and cleaning. Yes, the holidays are coming, but you should be doing this for yourself–not just for company! With both Neptune and Venus in such a prominent position your ideas could be wildly creative, not to mention sultry.

"
7979,31 october 2016,leo,"Sometimes you need to “play well with others”, other times you just gotta do your own thing. And this week it’s more about following your passions and creative impulses rather than waiting for everyone else to jump on board your train. You may be annoyed that others aren’t doing their part or are slacking in some way. All the more reason to focus on your own game plan and to work it.

"
7980,1 november 2016,leo,"The fog clears in emotional matters, things that may have been troubling you for some time. The Sun is in your house of contentment, urging you to release negativity so that you can enjoy a much happier future. Today it forms a glorious trine with vibey Neptune. The watery planet, interestingly enough, is in the house that governs the “deep waters” of your emotions, stirring them up to the surface of your psyche so that they can be released. Good riddance!

"
7981,2 november 2016,leo,"Even though the planets are pushing you to take care of matters at home and at the office, you need some time for you. And that doesn’t mean sitting in front of the TV with a beer. No, we’re talking about mind-expanding, enriching cultural experiences that will give you a renewed appreciation for the world we live in. The passionate Moon will stir you up today to feed your head with beauty.

"
7982,3 november 2016,leo,"Sometimes you can get away with flying by the seat of your pants, but the cosmos warns that now is not one of those times! Instead, you need to be organized, have a ritual, know what work has to be done in advance, keep your home running smoothly and stay on top of errands. Not sexy, I know, but with a full moon coming on the 14th in your house of ambition and success, you need to be prepared.

"
7983,4 november 2016,leo,"Too much work and not enough play could make for one cranky little lion. The planets are encouraging you to take some much-needed down time—NOW— before Venus enters your work sector in a week’s time. You could be quite busy wrapping up a work project due to the full moon on your career coming on the 14th, but for heaven’s sake, find some time to play.

"
7984,5 november 2016,leo,"Leos are known as the most creative sign of the zodiac and today your artistic mojo should rise (to quote Jim Morrison). Whether you’re a backyard gardener, weekend woodworker or a Grammy winning musician, it’s time to let those creative juices flow. If you’ve been ignoring hobbies or even the sports you used to enjoy, spontaneous Uranus will give you a swift kick in the pants to get back into the groove.

"
7985,6 november 2016,leo,"It’s time to start living la vida loca, Leo! A spunky Uranus-Venus trine urges you to spread those wings and fly–literally. Book a vacation to a far off destination where you can shake your shaggy mane. If travel is out of the question right now, then shake up your weekend routine of dinner and a movie, say, and switch to a wild night of dancing in a club. Life is too short to be in a rut. Vamanos.

"
7986,7 november 2016,leo,"With Mars just about ready to leave your sixth house of efficiency and getting things done, it would be wise to wrap up unfinished projects. Then create a list of the things you want to accomplish over the next few months, pour yourself a glass of wine or tea, and put your feet up. You’ve worked hard in recent weeks, Leo–time to chill. When Mercury enters your house of frisky fun on Saturday it’s time to start making plans that simply involve relaxing.

"
7987,8 november 2016,leo,"Partnerships will be heating up over the next five weeks, be they romantic or business-related. But be discerning about whom you connect with, as there could be a number of people who’ll want to be by your side. Don’t feel pressured to enter into a business alliance or amorous relationship if you’re not ready. That being said, joining forces with someone else could be the key to your future happiness and success. Perform due diligence and move ahead with your eyes wide open.

"
7988,9 november 2016,leo,"Sweet love! One of the best times ever for finding romance, raising happy children or developing a deeper bond with an amour is here, right now. Lusty Mars just entered your house of serious commitment for the first time since 2014, so start your engines! Then on Saturday talkative Mercury zips into your house of romance, which is actually a different spot than the partnership zone. The next few weeks are super for holding heartfelt conversations with loved ones. Singles—get the word out there that you’re available!

"
7989,10 november 2016,leo,"With a full moon approaching in the house of your goals and ambitions, no doubt you’re ruminating over which areas of your life need the most improvement. A Moon-Neptune conjunction today shines its light on your financial affairs, specifically the bedrock of your portfolio: savings, retirement accounts and debts. Fortunately for you, they form a helpful aspect with the Sun, and they’re determined to create a strong foundation. Start here first.

"
7990,11 november 2016,leo,"Business deals could heat up as people around you start to notice your creativity and brilliant ideas. The same holds true for romance, as you’re not looking like a shy little wall flower these days (but then do you ever?). Consider new offers and options that are put in front of you, then get ready to take action after the 14th. A full moon occurs in your house of ambition, giving you the impetus to move ahead on some of them. Just be wary of doing too much of the “heavy lifting” in alliances, a possibility under current planetary influences.

"
7991,12 november 2016,leo,"It can’t be all work all the time, Leo. The full moon on Monday does  fall in your house of career, and you may be putting the finishing touches on a big project. But Mercury’s entry into your frisky, romantic fifth house indicates that you need some play time too. No lover on the scene? Then take care of yourself by setting aside a few hours every week just for hobbies, reading a good book or (yessssss) a shopping expedition.

"
7992,13 november 2016,leo,"BIG career changes are on the horizon, as tomorrow’s full moon in your house of ambition is a super moon–the biggest full moon since 1948! Your creative juices should be flowing, thanks to Mercury now in your house of genius and inspiration. But don’t try to push things through too quickly, as others around you may put up resistance. You also need to take care of small details for the overall plans to fall together.

"
7993,14 november 2016,leo,"Expect new doors to bust open, Leo! A potent super moon (the most intense since 1948) occurs in your house of ambition today. It’s an amazing time to wrap up important projects you’ve been working on, and to get moving on even more exciting plans.If one of those “plans” happens to include finding love or progressing with an existing relationship, you’re in luck as a happy Mars-Mercury aspect is in your favor. However, keep details about work-related goals to yourself, as co-workers might want to put the kabosh on your ideas.

"
7994,15 november 2016,leo,"Yesterday’s powerful super moon in your ambition zone should kick off a new phase of achievement, so don’t be surprised if you attract people into your orbit who sense your can-do attitude. Today is excellent for talking with potential partners who are interested in forging an alliance. But make sure that you retain control of projects, especially the financial end. You don’t need hangers-on who intend to do little work but want to cash in on your success.

"
7995,16 november 2016,leo,"Pay close attention to the word and actions of friends and family members, as your relationship with some of them may need tweaking. This could mean pulling away, getting closer or just ignoring petty dramas. With so many planets pushing you forward with your ambitions (not to mention bringing intense love your way), you can’t let their opinions get in your way. Listen, consider what they say, then do your own thing.

"
7996,17 november 2016,leo,"If money has been tight lately, you could start feeling the pinch. But the good news is that the Moon in the most intuitive part of your chart is forming a superb aspect with intelligent Mercury in your creativity zone. There are  solutions out there to your dilemma—and you will be able to dream up innovative ways to earn more.

"
7997,18 november 2016,leo,"The calculating lion is looking a little starry eyed today, and that could be a problem! That’s because you  could end up being the prey of a love interest who’s hot but unreliable or a smooth-talking salesman. Protect your heart and your wallet with a heavy dose of common sense. When Neptune goes direct on Saturday your vision will become much clearer, and you’ll be able to accurately assess people for what they are.

"
7998,19 november 2016,leo,"Leos love luxury, and nothing is going to chap their regal asses than not having enough dinero to splurge. The good news is that Neptune goes direct today in your house of finances, helping to alleviate financial insecurity. Does this mean that you should run out and spend your hard earned money on swag? No—actually, the planets recommend spending conservatively. But with the Sun just about to enter the most fun-loving part of your chart, that may be hard to do!

"
7999,20 november 2016,leo,"The Moon in your sign this weekend is firing up your desire to live a more beautiful, cultured lifestyle, Leo. Whether you’re lusting over gorgeous items to decorate your home, drooling over the recipes in your favorite food blog, or trawling the travel sites in vacation planning mode, your motivation to live the good life is certainly increasing. When the Sun enters Sagittarius tomorrow, you’ll stop swooning and start doing!

"
8000,21 november 2016,leo,"“I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.” So said Albert Einstein, but I beg to differ–the dude was talented. And so are you, Leo! Now that the Sun is in the most expressive part of your chart, dig down into that wellspring of know-how and let your skills shine. If they happen to be a little rusty, then polish them up with a class, webinar or good instructional book. With lucky and profitable Jupiter in your learning sector for the first time in 13 years, this is a superb time to learn from the masters.

"
8001,22 november 2016,leo,"What is it like to be oozing charm from every pore, Leo? It’s a tough situation to be in (LOL), but you can handle it. Now that the Sun is in your dynamic house of talent, showmanship, creativity and fun, all eyes will be on you. Make sure to give your audience the performance they’re hoping to see. Think of fellow Leo Jackie Kennedy and you’ll get the idea.

"
8002,23 november 2016,leo,"Romance is in the air as energetic Mercury teams up with long term Saturn. Singles, get the word out that you’re on the market, as a new flame could be right around the corner. This hottie could turn into a serious candidate for marriage, so unless you’re looking for a quick hookup, be prepared for the real deal. Attached Leos could reignite romantic sparks, planning juicier date nights, conceiving a baby, or getting engaged. A new moon next week will open up a new window of opportunity for all lions to be happier in love.

"
8003,24 november 2016,leo,"Getting from point A to point B may not be as easy as you think, Leo! You may have an interesting plan or project you’d like to tackle, but you can’t just think big—you need to take the appropriate steps to get there. This isn’t a sprint, by the way, it will be a marathon. But when a number of planets move into Capricorn in December, you’ll be able to figure out precisely what needs to be done.

"
8004,25 november 2016,leo,"You’re on a roll, Leo! The planets are lighting a fire under your tush to get things done, and I’m not just referring to holiday shopping or home decorating. With so many planets in your house of creativity and raw talent, you want to show the world what you’ve got, which will require some effort and planning.

Inspirational Uranus sparks your talent as it trines intelligent Mercury, creating the perfect storm of smarts plus artistic mojo. And you ain’t seen nuthin’ yet. Just wait until next Tuesday’s new moon in the most expressive part of your chart.

"
8006,27 november 2016,leo,"A healthy lion is a sexy lion, and today the cosmos urges you to get in better physical shape, for no other reason than to dazzle your public. But you know deep down that a solid foundation of health and vitality is crucial for your peace of mind. The ancient Taoists viewed physical fitness as the gateway to better mental health and they were right!

"
8007,28 november 2016,leo,"You have some pretty interesting ideas these days, things you’d like to pursue. But are there enough hours in the day to get around to all of them? What about the help you’d need from other people? Thoughts and concerns may be rolling around in your head, causing doubts. But the new moon tomorrow will help you come up with creative solutions. Get ready to be inspired.

"
8008,29 november 2016,leo,"If you can dream it you can do it! That’s the message behind today’s new moon in the most creative part of your chart. The good news is that Saturn is in an excellent angle, supporting your efforts. The ringed planet governs discipline, solid habits and rational long-term planning, so you’ll have plenty of smarts along with expressive mojo.

8009,30 november 2016,leo,"Whip out the BS meter! Someone may be blowing smoke in your direction, hoping to win favor with you. You have something they want, but it’s not your responsibility to give it to them. With the energetic Sun in the most expressive part of your chart, you’re being doused with creativity and charisma. Is it any surprise, therefore, that others want to bask in your light?

"
8010,1 december 2016,leo,"The recent new moon in your house of skill and talent should be shaking you out of a rut and into a place where you’re ready to show off your chops to the rest of the world. Well, today a magnificent meeting between Mars and Jupiter will enable you to reach out to others who can make some big dreams happen. Don’t hold back, expecting the world to beat a path to your door! You need to put yourself out there, and that includes romantically as well. Serious partnerships, both in business and romance, can be established now.

"
8011,2 december 2016,leo,"OK Disney fans, remember the song, “Whistle While You Work” from Snow White?  It’s all about getting the chores out of the way, a helpful thing to do before you start singing, “Someday my prince will come.” Well, that pretty much sums up your situation, Leo. Industrious Mercury enters your house of efficiency today, urging you to get your act together both at home and the office. Considering that love planet Venus is about to enter your commitment sector next week, you don’t want to be burdened by annoying tasks when you could be flirting with the Prince. Or Princess.

"
8012,3 december 2016,leo,"Partnerships can be cemented in the weeks ahead as a number of planetary aspects are clearing the path for connecting with others. This includes romantic alliances as well as business ones, so expect to be busy! Today serious Saturn is determined to find you only the strongest kind of love, something with long term potential. Creative projects are also well favored. If you’re looking for an agent, writing partner or someone to promote your talent, reach out to as many people as possible between now and the 13th.

"
8013,4 december 2016,leo,"Sometimes a languid lion needs to be jolted out of a restful nap and start feeling lively! The cosmos will be stirring up your creative juices as well as your love life this week. A passionate Mars-Moon-Jupiter aspect today encourages you to reach out to others and connect.

"
8015,6 december 2016,leo,"The planets are lining up to take your skills and talents to a much bigger stage, and positive events may occur that you’re not expecting. That means that you need to be ready—with an updated resume, a 15-second elevator pitch, a brag book or portfolio, stylish hair, the right clothes and a decent manicure (that includes you gents!). You only get one chance to make a good impression, and while your skills will speak for themselves, your image needs to be spotless too.

"
8016,7 december 2016,leo,"Love is in the air, Leo! Romance planet Venus glides into your commitment sector today, bringing new love to singles and a more sizzling sense of amour to coupled up lions. The key is to make sure that your partner shares the same values and goals as you, which could become an issue at the time of next Tuesday’s full moon. Don’t try to force your opinions on someone in the hopes that they’ll agree. Keep the lines of communication open.

"
8017,8 december 2016,leo,"Partnerships, be they business or romantic, seem to be in a state of flux right now. It’s important to consider the ideas and opinions of the people around you, as they can be on to something good—and they may also be right! But you’re also in an excellent position to provide input, as the mighty Sun is in your house of creativity, self-expression and talent. Caring is sharing—trite but true.

8018,9 december 2016,leo,"It’s time to get serious about your craft, Leo, whatever that means to you: your parenting skills, various responsibilities at the day job, study habits or honing your artistic talent. Like right now. A megawatt meeting on Saturday between the Sun and Saturn will push you to create new habits and routines. The good news? They’ll stick, and you’ll see fabulous results between now and October of 2017.

"
8019,10 december 2016,leo,"Reality check! If you’ve been on a fluffy pink cloud somewhere, idolizing a love interest or pretending that a romantic partner doesn’t have the very obvious flaws that everyone else can see, wake up. A serious meeting today between the Sun and Saturn tells you to get real. This also includes your kids. It’s time for tough love, not enabling.

"
8020,11 december 2016,leo,"If you’re truly fortunate, you’re in a line of work that you love. That’s not the case for most people, and the proud lion can be found dragging its tail if it has to skulk off to a soul sucking job. An optimistic Moon-Pluto aspect, however, is super for getting passionate about your career. Pluto is the planet of transformation, so if you’re not happy with what you do, it’s time for a reboot. Yesterday’s intense Sun-Saturn meeting fell in your house of skills and talent, which means that it’s time to get serious about yours. Don’t settle.

"
8021,12 december 2016,leo,"You might stumble upon some pretty interesting ideas today, Leo, thanks to a meet up between the Sun in the most creative part of your chart and spontaneous Uranus. They could deal with love, they could deal with money, but overall these brainstorms are all about living a much bigger life–one without so many boundaries. You could simply hear a phrase that hits you the right way, or pick up a book that helps you see things in a different light. Seize the moment.

"
8022,13 december 2016,leo,"Wrap up tech projects, marketing launches, team efforts and entrepreneurial activities. The full moon in your house of big ideas and plans urges closing these out so that you can move on to the next step. That being said, don’t be too quick to get things out in the public eye as it seems that they’re not quite ready for prime time. Spend the next few weeks finishing up the details, then get ready to launch after December 29th. That day a new moon occurs in your house of work assignments, and Uranus finally goes direct in the publicity sector.

"
8023,14 december 2016,leo,"With abundant Jupiter in your house of self-expression, you may feel relaxed enough to speak what’s on your mind. But today you might want to keep your thoughts and words to yourself as a tough aspect indicates that you could be facing opposition. Your ideas and opinions have merit and they’re far-sighted, but others may not be able to see the forest for the trees. Wait until after the 21st when the Sun enters Capricorn to start hashing things out with your colleagues, friends, lover and family.

"
8024,15 december 2016,leo,"The proud lion doesn’t do well when confronted with boundaries, preferring unlimited horizons. However, there is such a thing as reality, and it produces circumstances that you have to live with—at least for now. With spunky Uranus acting up in your house of limitlessness, you may feel those boundaries more intensely today and want to rebel against them. Save your energy. Don’t fight; figure out a way to go after your passions within your existing situation.

"
8025,17 december 2016,leo,"Don’t be surprised if you decide to pick up a new hobby or sport this weekend, or return to one that gave you joy in the past. With the Moon in Leo and the Sun in the most creative part of your chart, it’s time to cut loose and put some energy into things you’re passionate about. You could become so inspired that you decide to join a group of like minded people who are involved in the same activity.

"
8026,18 december 2016,leo,"If you haven’t been seeing eye to eye with someone, make an attempt to work things out today. It may not be easy with a Moon-Mars opposition but you’ll be glad later on this week that you did. That’s because the red planet moves into one of the most emotional parts of your chart tomorrow, and issues about money and sharing responsibilities could erupt in a big way.

"
8027,19 december 2016,leo,"You’re in an excellent position to make headway with big financial plans, as long as you remember that the devil is in the details. Today high energy Mars rolls into your house of big money, opening up a seven-week period which could prove to be quite lucrative. But Mercury retrogrades in your house of strategizing and streamlining. The message? Solid habits and systems are required to see more of the green stuff. Flying by the seat of your pants isn’t going to cut it.

"
8028,20 december 2016,leo,"Feeling frisky? You should be, Leo, now that lusty Mars is in your house of libido and intimacy for the first time in two years! However, duty calls as the Sun will be entering your get-it-done sector tomorrow. Yes, this is the least sexy part of your chart, the place where we clean out closets, organize the sock drawer and catch up on unfinished work projects. Sigh. If it’s of any consolation to you it’s also the house of getting fit and toned, so take that feline energy and pour it into developing a hot, buff body!

"
8029,21 december 2016,leo,"Ready to make some major progress with your finances? You should be, now that Mars is in your house of financial security. The cosmos is planning on keeping you busy with assignments that will raise your profile and skill level, but first you have to take care of unfinished projects. Not only that, it appears that the methods and habits you use for accomplishing your goals need an overhaul, so get going now. The slow week between Christmas and New Year’s is actually a great time for getting your act together. The faster you do that, the faster you’ll see more money.

"
8030,22 december 2016,leo,"You may feel completely entitled to express your opinion, but the cosmos warns to hold back on your thoughts and words. There could be a surprising amount of resistance from certain quarters that you may not expect, so the smart lion keeps their cards close to their vest. This vibe continues to grow up to the 26th, so remain on your guard.

"
8031,23 december 2016,leo,"Releasing negative emotions and past dramas can actually be a rather painless activity today as the Moon forms a helpful trine with energetic Mars in two of the most cathartic parts of your chart. This may be just the perfect holiday gift from the cosmos, Leo! Why carry bad mojo with you into 2017? When Uranus goes direct on the 29th you might start delving into ancient or foreign philosophies that will open your mind to a new way of thinking.

"
8032,24 december 2016,leo,"Taking your talent and skills to a whole new level is what the cosmos has in mind for you, Leo. And today’s happy Uranus-Saturn trine may push you into developing that talent in 2017. Practice makes perfect, so start scheduling time for it. Whether you need to take a class, get advice from a mentor, watch some videos or listen to podcasts, make this a serious goal for the new year ahead.

"
8033,25 december 2016,leo,"Going it alone doesn’t appear to be in the cards–or should I say the cosmos?–right now. With generous Venus in your house of partnerships sending lucky beans to three other planets, the stage is being set for creating or developing alliances. Whether they’re for love, business or just for fun, these connections will become a big part of your life in the months to come.

"
8034,26 december 2016,leo,"Two of the most liberating planets, Uranus and Jupiter, form a rare (once very 14 years) aspect in the heavens. The problem is that they are opposing each other, creating a conundrum: which path to take? In your case, they oppose each other in houses that deal with lofty goals, entrepreneurship and personal growth. You may need to cut certain options from your life in order to pursue something that’s important to you. Clarity will arrive by the weekend.

"
8035,27 december 2016,leo,"The planets are sparking your mind with inspiration, so take this gift from the cosmos and run with it. Mars is currently in the house of making big money and the sun is illuminating the path ahead. Tomorrow brings even more bright ideas, so keep a pad of paper nearby and write them down. The new moon on Thursday is the time to initiate them.

"
8036,28 december 2016,leo,"While other signs may think that you spend your time lounging and luxuriating, what they don’t realize is that the chill lion can actually be quite the work horse. You just make it look so easy, that’s why! And you’re going to need to put that hard work ethic to good use once tomorrow’s new moon arrives. Rest up today and recharge your batteries, Leo. The next six months are going to be very  busy.

"
8037,29 december 2016,leo,"Take your foot off the brakes, Leo. Today’s new moon in Capricorn kicks open doors that may have been shut in the past. Since it falls in your house of streamlining and organizing you’re going to be gung ho about pulling your life together so that it runs like a Swiss clock. It’s not enough to have big ideas: you need a workable plan and intense attention to details in order to pull them off. You’ll be able to make a lot of progress even before 2017 begins!

"
8038,30 december 2016,leo,"Hey everyone, I’ve got a secret to spill! Leos are planning world domination next year. While you’re getting ready to party like it’s 2017, the lion is quietly stalking around, strategizing and getting inspired by Neptune. This is the sign that’s going to surprise everyone in the months ahead, because they’re starting early on their New Year’s resolutions. But they’re way too proud (and stealthy) to admit it!

"
8039,31 december 2016,leo,"Talk flirty to me! It’s a sweet time to let someone know how you feel as the planets are ratcheting up your charisma and chattiness factor. Single? Then you have the cosmos’s permission to be an unabashed flirt, so get out there and work it. To your surprise, a lover with long term potential may appear on the horizon, so this is no time to hide your light under a bushel.

"
8040,1 january 2017,virgo,"Pick a partner! A sizzling connection today between Neptune and Mars tells you that two heads are better than one this year, Virgo. This holds true for business, volunteer work, love, working out and simply enjoying life. 2017 is not the year of playing the lone wolf. Singles stand a good chance of meeting someone new within the next few weeks and attached Virgos can reboot their romance.

"
8041,2 january 2017,virgo,"Building a stronger financial portfolio is the order of the day now that erratic Uranus has resumed direct motion in your fiscal sector. And it’s quite possible that teaming up with someone else is the best way to go about earning more! If you’re in a creative line of work, bringing in someone with a fresh perspective could be profitable. But regardless of your field, sharing responsibilities with someone sharp could add to your bottom line.

"
8042,3 january 2017,virgo,"2017 is off to a fast start, Virgo, especially where matters of the heart are involved. Amorous Neptune and dynamic Mars were in your house of commitment on the 1st and now lovely Venus joins them for a four week stay. Singles, this is one of your best times all year to meet someone new: don’t waste a moment of it! Coupled Virgos should find it easier to communicate and to make plans for the future. Not happy in love? Then this coming weekend could be a game changer in which someone new appears on the horizon.

"
8043,4 january 2017,virgo,"Family ties will count in the week ahead as Mercury back spins into your domestic sector. Now’s the time to work out any lingering issues that carried over from 2016: squabbles with relatives, roommates or landlords, custody battles over children, or making the decision to move (or not). Fortunately Venus just entered your commitment sector, so at least your partner should be on board with your concerns and decisions. If they’re not there yet, know that Venus will be here until February 3rd, so you have a month to come to good terms.

"
8044,6 january 2017,virgo,"If a romantic or family drama has been going on for far too long, with feelings getting hurt (primarily yours), now’s the time to voice your opinions. Will everyone appreciate it? Probably not. Will they change right away? Doubtful. But you have a life to live, and with next week’s full moon occurring in your house of big plans, you’re not going to be in the mood for dealing with kaka. Speak your mind. If you don’t, you’ll be at the mercy of others, not a place you want to be in the months ahead.

"
8045,7 january 2017,virgo,"Passion could reach new heights as the Moon connects with rebellious Uranus. Tired of boring sex or just being a mom instead of a woman? Worn out with working so many hours that you have no energy left for love, hobbies, fun or just enjoying flat brain waves? Today will inspire you to bust out of those ruts, plus plenty more!

"
8046,8 january 2017,virgo,"If big plans or hopes have been taking too much time to manifest, this Thursday’s full moon in Cancer may light a fire under you to take some serious action. Helping matters along is the return of direct motion with good old Mercury, which has been dragging its heels in your house of home and family. Residential issues can now be resolved along with putting an end to family squabbles.

"
8047,9 january 2017,virgo,"Who’s the boss? You may feel the need to take charge of a romantic situation that’s run aground, or a business deal that’s stuck in red tape or confusion. The problem is that the other party may be in a feisty mood, so tread carefully. This vibe continues into tomorrow so you’ll need to keep your cool. Remove your emotions from the situation as best you can.

"
8048,10 january 2017,virgo,"The next 48 hours could be a bit of an emotional roller coaster as the Sun squares Uranus in two of the most sensitive parts of your chart. Kids, lovers, co-workers, family members: they could all be in some kind of a snit, laying on guilt and drama. Take your emotions out of the equation and remember that someone has to be a grownup, and it might as well be you.

"
8049,11 january 2017,virgo,"Serious relationships can experience a renaissance, a rebirth, thanks to dynamic Mars and metamorphic Pluto stirring up positive changes this part of your chart. But usually optimistic Jupiter is in a funky mood today, urging you to pay attention to the basics: your household or company budget, who is responsible for what duties and chores, and making sure that you’re building an alliance on solid ground. Don’t indulge in airy-fairy thoughts, expecting these things to take care of themselves. They won’t, which means that you need to attend to them.

"
8050,12 january 2017,virgo,"Some important dreams, aspirations or projects may be coming to a well-deserved close, thanks to today’s full moon in Cancer. Conveniently, intelligent and quick-witted Mercury enters your house of creativity too, enabling you to push forward with new enterprises and give them some flair. However, some of the people around you may be resisting progress by dragging their feet or causing projects to run over budget. Keep an eye on anyone whose input or assistance you need to get things done, and make sure that they’re handling their responsibilities.

"
8051,13 january 2017,virgo,"The planets are all in alignment for showering you with love and affection, Virgo! Mercury just entered your house of fun and romance. Yesterday’s full moon fell in the sector of fulfilling some of your biggest hopes and wishes. And now Venus and Neptune are holding a serious convo in your commitment sector! singles, be on the lookout for some serious love material. Attached Virgos: all I can say is that you deserve the best, so reach out and grab it.

"
8052,14 january 2017,virgo,"Trust issues? Depending upon others could be frustrating as people around you could be slacking off or refusing to cooperate. It wouldn’t be a problem if you could get everything done on your own, but you can’t—and so it is. With aggressive Mars in your partnership sector, you could set a lover or your kids straight. Co-workers and friends are another story. When the Sun enters Aquarius next Thursday you’ll be able to take control of work projects, so the office slackers only have a few more days to goof off.

"
8053,15 january 2017,virgo,"Recent planetary activity can set your creativity soaring, encouraging you to make the most of your talent. This is just as true in your personal affairs as the office, and people around you will notice your flair and positive attitude. But when it comes to working with others, choose carefully. Not everyone is as committed or skilled as you are, and you don’t need anyone slowing you down.

"
8054,16 january 2017,virgo,"A little bit of “me” time is just what the cosmic doctor is ordering today, Virgo! You’ve had a lot of planetary emphasis lately on taking care of others, but it looks like you need to recharge your batteries. You could rest at home with a good book but the cosmos suggests a fun evening out on the town. Or a shopping spree….massage….mani/pedi….

"
8055,17 january 2017,virgo,"If you’re looking for security in a situation, then it’s up to you to find it. Don’t fall victim to empty promises or flattery from people who can never seem to give you what you want. Whether it’s a romance, career matter or family drama, it’s time to cut bait or move upstream.
 
 

"
8056,18 january 2017,virgo,"You’re entering into a time period which will be far more structured, not usually a problem for people of your sign. But even if you’re on top of your chores and demonstrating good habits, it doesn’t mean that the people around you are. Make sure that others know what is expected of them, whether it’s a spouse, your kids, employees, co-workers or team members. A positive Mars-Jupiter aspect today will help straighten things out. It may not happen overnight, but by the time of the new moon on the 27th you can lock in new rules.

"
8057,19 january 2017,virgo,"The planets warn against trying to make certain relationships move faster than they currently are. Whether it’s a potential client you’re wooing, neighborhood connections you’d like to solidify or developing more momentum in a romantic alliance, you need to slow down. Impatient Mars is anxious to wrap things up, but you run the risk of annoying people if you push too hard. Chill.

"
8058,20 january 2017,virgo,"Get ready to delegate, Virgo! The Sun has just entered the sector that governs organization and getting things done. But this doesn’t mean doing everything yourself, even if you do think that you’re the only one who can do it right! Hire new staff or household help. Do your food shopping online and have it delivered. Swap baby sitting duties with another mom in the neighborhood so that you can go out and do your errands alone. Find better service providers that know how to deliver without the headaches. Under current planetary influences, it’s up to you to get this rolling: don’t wait for a spouse or co-workers to get their s*** together.

"
8059,21 january 2017,virgo,"Did you fall off the fitness bandwagon around January 5th or so? Then now is your best time to climb back on it and stay there. The Sun has just entered your house of vitality and health, encouraging you to focus more on your body. Treat it like the temple it is. Start researching diets, supplements, and exercise regimens that might work for you, as well as making appointments with health care practitioners. The new moon on the 27th is a great time to start afresh.

"
8060,22 january 2017,virgo,"With the Sun now in the sector that governs the creation of better habits, it’s time to take a look at how you handle household chores and activities. A helpful Moon-Sun aspect will enable you to pinpoint weaknesses in your system so that you find hacks that will streamline and destress your life.

"
8061,23 january 2017,virgo,"Getting the straight story from a family member or lover could be tough today, which may make you feel unsettled. With a Moon-Saturn conjunction taking place, you’re in no mood for unanswered questions, especially if they have to deal with your sense of security. But this is a temporary blip on the cosmic radar. Tomorrow is much better for getting the full scoop.

8062,24 january 2017,virgo,"Your ability to express yourself with creativity and verve today is off the charts, Virgo! Naturally this bodes well for anyone in an artistic or conceptual line of work, but it also can help you communicate better with your kids or a lover in a fresh new way. It’s also a super time to get back into some hobbies that you may have neglected or have been interested in trying “some day”. Some day is here.

"
8063,25 january 2017,virgo,"Your motivation to find new love may rise with a happy Moon-Pluto conjunction. The same holds true for those Virgos who are attached, and you may demand some changes in your relationship. The good news is that the planets are working on your behalf, enabling you to communicate your needs and expectations to your amour. Singles, a prospect with long term potential could be out there—and they could be in your line of work. Trade show or seminar, anyone?

"
8064,26 january 2017,virgo,"Looking to develop more security and structure in a serious partnership? Then today’s the day, as optimistic Jupiter is in a good spot from your house of self-confidence and establishing happy boundaries. This vibe will continue into the following week, especially with tomorrow’s new moon in your efficient sixth house. This is no time to be flying by the seat of your pants in romantic or business alliances.

"
8065,27 january 2017,virgo,"If you want a romance to move along more smoothly, Virgo, you may have to do some inner work. It seems that there are issues from the past, old family dramas from childhood in particular, that you need to release. But you’re in an excellent place to take new mental habits and run with them, thanks to today’s new moon in your efficient, organized sixth house. Years of therapy? Who needs it! Practicality is the name of the game as catharsis can take place quickly.

"
8066,28 january 2017,virgo,"Padding your wallet and financial portfolio can get a heck of a lot easier now that aggressive Mars is in your house of wealth. Just yesterday a new moon occurred in the sector that governs efficiency, streamlining and landing more assignments. The message? If you want to earn more, you need to have excellent work habits, not to mention smart protocols and talented people around you. Increasing your net worth is an achievable goal as long as you pay attention to your daily efforts and the details.

"
8067,29 january 2017,virgo,"Emotions could be bubbling under that usually calm surface of yours, Virgo! As Mercury and Pluto heat up your romance sector, you’re going to have to watch out for troublesome feelings like resentment or jealousy. Your sex life could be awesome over the next few weeks, thanks to lusty Mars in your house of libido, but be careful that you’re thinking rationally about your love life. Singles, don’t mistake steaming hot sex for love. It ain’t that simple.

"
8068,30 january 2017,virgo,"Yowza! The planets are piling up in your houses of sex, passion and romance, so don’t be surprised if that’s all you can think of. Today is quite amorous with a steamy Moon-Neptune conjunction. Singles, it’s a good day to meet someone at a cultural event (think concert, museum, art gallery) and couples, you should plan some time alone. The cosmos doesn’t always deliver goodies like this, so carpe diem.

"
8069,31 january 2017,virgo,"With so much recent planetary activity in your houses of romance and passion, you should be feeling quite amorous. However, erratic Uranus may be stirring up the green eyed monster or feelings of resentment. Singles, comparing yourself to others isn’t going to bring in Prince or Princess Charming. Attached Virgos need to toss negative emotions that could interfere with their relationship. Avoid outbursts and stubbornness at all costs.

"
8070,1 february 2017,virgo,"Keep the plastic in your wallet and avoid retail therapy, Virgo. A tense Moon-Uranus aspect could bring about emotional spending. Adding to this aspect is the presence of ever-optimistic Jupiter in your income sector, which might convince you that you’ll have no problem in finding the cash to pay the bill sometime in the future. This is just the beginning of austerity: when Jupiter retrogrades on the 6th, you’ll need to stay on budget for several months.

"
8071,2 february 2017,virgo,"Hmmm, it looks like someone needs to get their groove back. If you’re tired of being a good old dependable Virgo and long for living a more exciting, passionate lifestyle, you’re in luck. Red hot Mars is currently carving a path through your house of joy and intensity (which includes sex drive, dontcha know), telling you that you don’t have to remain in a boring old rut. Make a vow to start living a bit more of la vida loca.

"
8072,3 february 2017,virgo,"Ggrrr! Feeling sexy, Virgo? You should be now that Venus is in your house of libido and passion. This sector isn’t just about our basic instincts, however. Being able to relate to someone on a much deeper level (can you say “soulmate”?) is found here also. But on March 4th Venus retrogrades, so if there are any issues in your romance, get them worked out before then.

"
8073,4 february 2017,virgo,"If you’ve been longing to put more excitement into your romance—or to meet someone who knows how to enjoy life—this weekend is the time to go for it. The Moon is in the most optimistic, freewheeling part of your chart, challenging you to take ownership of your personal time and passion. There’s a saying: life is too short to drink cheap beer and dance with boring men (and women), so start pursuing la vida loca.

"
8074,5 february 2017,virgo,"Just how much responsibility are you willing to take in your key relationships, both at home and at the office? You may not want to take charge, fearing that you’ll come off as bossy or that it’s easier to let others run the show. Sorry, Virgo! The planets suggest otherwise, telling you to start creating boundaries. While you’re at it, let everyone know what their duties are—and that you intend to hold people to them.

"
8075,6 february 2017,virgo,"Begin a financial austerity plan (otherwise known as a budget) now, Libra! The usually abundant Jupiter is kicking off a four-month slowdown in your income sector. Clients could be hesitant to sign on the dotted line, expenses might be higher than planned, and job hunts could get stymied with delays. But this doesn’t mean that progress can’t be made. There is a benefit to a Jupiter retrograde period in that it can give you the opportunity to uncover new income streams, develop better habits and become more orderly about how you get your job done.

"
8076,7 february 2017,virgo,"Get your “Type A” groove on, Virgo! Mercury enters your highly strategic and efficient sixth house today, telling you to get your house in order–literally and figuratively. Bring order to your home and office by decluttering, wrapping up unfinished tasks and making lists of what has to be done next. Your body is also the “home” in which your spirit resides, so take excellent care of it through healthy eating and exercise.

"
8077,8 february 2017,virgo,"Your personal finances should be just that, Virgo: personal. Don’t get sucked into buying things because of whiny kids, a lover who wants to live a more luxe lifestyle or because your friends appear to have more “toys” than you do. Now that Jupiter is retrograde in your income sector, budgeting is the name of the game. People in your circle may resist your new austerity measures, but you’ll end up being the one with money in the bank.

"
8078,9 february 2017,virgo,"You’ve been working hard, Virgo, and your smarts have been noticed by others. Over the next few days an assignment (or a job offer) might come your way and it could take you by surprise. The lunar eclipse on Friday occurs in your “behind closed doors” sector, so your best bet is to keep things on the downlow: job hunts, marketing strategies, product launches and client negotiations.

"
8079,10 february 2017,virgo,"Get out the pruning shears—or maybe I should suggest a chainsaw. A megawatt lunar eclipse in the sector that governs your deepest thoughts, emotions and habits is encouraging you to cut out things that aren’t working for you. This could be toxic people, obligations that are weighing you down, or even negative thought patterns that seem to replay in your head every day. There is a strong financial focus surrounding the eclipse, so if you’re looking for more money or better working conditions now is the time to quietly start making inquiries. Over the next six months you’ll be releasing more and more “trash” from your life so that only the good stuff can come in.

"
8080,11 february 2017,virgo,"“Nothing so needs reforming as other people’s habits.”  So said wit and author Mark Twain, but today the cosmos tells you to examine your own routines. Fortunately a superb Sun-Jupiter aspect will enable you to create solid, simple habits and rituals that will positively streamline your life. The best part is that there’s a strong financial vibe with this. The more you clean up your act, the more money you’ll save by being a smart shopper. Likewise, your productivity will be noticed by decision makers.

"
8081,12 february 2017,virgo,"A practical approach needs to be taken to love, Virgo. Your sign is certainly not known for engaging in unrealistic fantasies, but the cosmos warns that you might fall prey to delusional thinking today. It’s also possible that a lover (or a wannabe) is blowing a lot of smoke in your direction. Keep the lines of communication open and clear.

"
8082,13 february 2017,virgo,"The Moon in your sign may be pushing you to do something about your physique, Virgo, not to mention your health and vitality level. You’re in an excellent position to seek out a balanced diet, smart exercise routine and a good doctor, if you need one. This energy runs clear into next week, so don’t be surprised if you start waking up earlier for a morning run. With disciplined Saturn in your domestic sector a home-based routine is the way to go.

"
8083,14 february 2017,virgo,"Your sign tends to be viewed as the ultra-practical (read: non-romantic) group of the zodiac, but there’s a lusty creature lurking beneath that pulled-together facade. Mars and Venus are both nestled in your sexy eighth house of passion and intimacy today, calling for a steamy boudoir scene. Singles, you may be in a more thoughtful mood as the Moon and Jupiter have you thinking about security and traditional love. The good news is that you can have both a serious connection and a soulmate at the same time.

"
8084,15 february 2017,virgo,"Your income and savings may not be matching your goals for building a strong financial foundation, something that could hit you today in an emotional way. Don’t kid yourself about an upcoming promotion, job or windfall if it’s sketchy. You need earnings that are rock solid. Start seeking out sources of money that you can count on.

"
8085,16 february 2017,virgo,"You certainly know how to get things done these days, Virgo. An inner passion is driving you to make headway, and this  energy will continue through all of next week. As a result don’t be surprised if people notice your can-do attitude and want to team up.

"
8086,17 february 2017,virgo,"Pay attention to the fine print today, Virgo, and the words uttered by others as well. If someone is making a promise to complete a project make sure to get it in writing, or at least take your own notes. You know what thy say about verbal agreements—they’re not worth the paper they’re written on.

"
8087,18 february 2017,virgo,"So what’s the deal? Are you staying in a relationship or getting out? Remaining a confirmed single, or are you ready to jump back into the deep end of the dating pool again? The Sun’s entry into your partnership sector will shine some light on your closest alliances, which also happens to include business partners. A solar eclipse on the 26th will be a make or break point. Start thinking things over now.

"
8088,19 february 2017,virgo,"Sometimes you can learn more about a person–where they’re coming from, what their emotional state is all about–by sitting back and letting things flow. That’s the cosmos’s advice, Virgo, as beating someone over the head and demanding answers will backfire. Being passive can actually work in your favor.

"
8089,20 february 2017,virgo,"Your work load could pick up this week, which may not thrill you at first as it seems that your existing loads, both at home and at the office, are already heavy. But the new opportunities could be money makers, something that could add some serious coin to your financial portfolio down the road.

"
8090,21 february 2017,virgo,"You may need to take another look at your budget, whether it’s your household balance sheet or one at work. A superb Mercury-Jupiter trine, the best angle possible, could help you find cost-cutting measures. Creating better habits is a part of this energy, so consider what you can do to save more.

"
8091,22 february 2017,virgo,"Common sense and cool thinking will be in short supply today, Virgo–especially at your end! You’ll be driven more by emotion, passion and ambition more than anything else, which could end up being a volatile situation. Keep your wits about you and watch your words. Don’t say anything you might regret later on.

"
8092,23 february 2017,virgo,"Let the past inform the future. If you have a decision to make, think back to other times when you were faced with something similar and ask yourself what you can do this time to make a better choice. A helpful aspect between two of the most logical planets, Mercury and Saturn, will ease the process.

"
8093,24 february 2017,virgo,"There are plenty of good reasons to work out and take excellent care of your health: lower blood pressure, a more supple body, fewer aches and pains. But what about looking smokin’ hot and sexy? Huh? Is it a crime to exercise so that you leave a trail of salivating, lusty admirers in your wake? I think not. A sassy little Moon-Venus aspect today tells you that vanity isn’t such a bad thing.

"
8094,25 february 2017,virgo,"Serious relationships take center stage with two big aspects occurring this weekend. Today chatty Mercury enters your commitment sector, followed by a lunar eclipse on Sunday. These are awesome placements for meeting a potential spouse, making progress with a lover or inking a deal with a business collaborator. The next six months are game changers.

"
8095,26 february 2017,virgo,"Should I stay or should I go? An eclipse in your house of key relationships, business and personal, asks that question. If a certain connection has been less than rewarding over the past months or years, you may decide to cut the cords and move on. But you could also move forward in a big way with someone who wants to be part of your life, such as getting engaged or signing a deal with an agent. Just make sure that you’re totally clear about the financial history of anyone you partner with.

"
8096,27 february 2017,virgo,"Feeling lustier than a pirate on shore leave? Blame it on a fiery meet up of the two most hotblooded planets–Mars and Uranus–in your house of passion. Yowza! Just don’t get blinded by sex and drama. Otherwise, get thee to the boudoir.

"
8097,28 february 2017,virgo,"Moody blues! Intense emotions may arise as the passionate Moon meets up with Venus. Someone close may try to push your buttons, such as a lover or a child. You can’t let them take control of this situation no matter how much you love them. Sometimes tough love works, and that’s the way you need to go today.

"
8098,1 march 2017,virgo,"Your love life can take quite a glamorous turn thanks to a yummy Sun-Neptune meeting in the heavens. Singles, you could meet a sexy new suitor who knows how to savor the finer things. And if you’re involved in a romance that has grown a little dull, now’s the time to spice things up. Use your imagination, which is getting fired up for more fun thanks to Neptune’s amorous influence.

"
8099,3 march 2017,virgo,"Just how much freedom do you need in your closest relationships? A Moon-Pluto trine asks that question of you today. If someone has been holding you back from going after your dreams, or you don’t feel as though you can express who you truly are, it’s time for some soul-searching. Once assertive Mars changes signs on the 9th you’ll be ready to bust out of confining situations.

"
8100,4 march 2017,virgo,"If your romance needs some serious repair work the next four weeks will make it glaringly obvious! Venus retrogrades today in your house of intimacy and libido, so matters of the boudoir could really be on your radar—not to mention money. Watch the tendency to get embroiled in arguments. Singles, if you’re still brooding over a breakup the month ahead could be an emotional one. Be wary of exes on the comeback trail too.

"
8101,5 march 2017,virgo,"Figuring out what makes us feel comfortable and content can sometimes be difficult, especially when we’re busily keeping other people happy. But today you can focus on your own needs and emotions. The Taoists have a saying: no matter where you are, you’re always home. “Home” is the inner peace that you can carry with you everywhere.

"
8102,6 march 2017,virgo,"Can we talk? Love planet Venus just went retrograde in your house of intimacy and sex, which means that issues that need to be addressed will come bubbling to the surface. Fortunately diplomatic Mercury is on the job today, helping you open up and speak your piece. The whole week is good for holding talks, by the way, so get them started right now. Singles–get the word out that you’re on the market.

"
8103,7 march 2017,virgo,"Listen to your own voice today, Virgo. Friends and colleagues may be plying you with their advice, but from your chart it appears that their opinions are off base. Your choice of lover, career and lifestyle is your own. March to the beat of your own drum—especially after Thursday, when Mars enters the most optimistic part of your chart.

"
8104,8 march 2017,virgo,"Yum! A sweet Mercury-Pluto aspect encourages you to get flirty with your amour, and maybe even talk about the more serious stuff while you’re at it. Singles, with both the Sun and Mercury in your house of commitment, a keeper may be in your midst. With Mars about to enter your house of travel and education, you could meet a new honey at a vacation destination or in the stacks.

"
8105,9 march 2017,virgo,"Boundaries? Limits? What the hell are they? They’re meant to be broken, Virgo! Now that ambitious Mars is in your house of adventure it’s time to take some risks. Nothing stupid, mind you. Just breaking away from doing things the same old way. With Sunday’s full moon coming in your house of self-image it’s time to dump an old, worn-out self image and replace it with something far more intriguing.

"
8106,10 march 2017,virgo,"Resolving issues in love or with family members becomes easier with today’s planetary aspects. Sunday’s full moon falls in Virgo, putting your needs on the front burner. Work things out now with the people closest to you so that you can focus on your own passion projects over the next six months.

"
8107,11 march 2017,virgo,"It’s time to get your finances in order, Virgo. This is one of your best years in over a decade to increase your bottom line, but it won’t happen unless you’re paying attention to what’s going on around you. Under current planetary aspects your best bet for earning more may come from joining forces with someone else. This could mean a standard business partnership, or retaining the services of a savvy expert to help you achieve your goals— a booking agent, manager, literary agent, talent scout or PR person would all qualify.

"
8108,12 march 2017,virgo,"Woo-hoo! Tonight’s full moon falls in your sign, Virgo. This is a terrific time to wrap up projects that you may have initiated over the past six months so that you can go after some new ones. Truth be told, some of the people closest to you may not be 100% on board with your ideas, but who cares. You’re going to do what you want anyhow. With Pluto pushing you to have some fun and show off your talent, don’t let anyone talk you into standing along the sidelines.

"
8109,13 march 2017,virgo,"Does a romance need repair work? If so, Mercury’s move into Aries today is just the ticket for opening up the lines of communication. Venus has been retrograde here for about a week, possibly stirring up doubts and concerns. But now the lines of communication open wide. Singles, a sexy new flame is on the horizon, especially after the 20th.

"
8110,14 march 2017,virgo,"Developing a stronger financial foundation is a big theme for you this year, Virgo, but you can’t do it if other people are pulling on the purse strings. Don’t let a lover, kids or family members convince you to spend money on things you can’t afford. If an ex or someone else owes you money (in a court case, say) today could be difficult. But when the Sun enters your finance sector next week you start to gain control.

"
8111,15 march 2017,virgo,"Start thinking on a more long term basis when it comes to your finances. Stern Saturn wants you to develop a nest egg and the peace of mind that comes along with it. The new moon on the 28th is perfect for launching new savings and income strategies, so start planning now.

"
8112,16 march 2017,virgo,"Choose your words carefully, Virgo, and consider your ”audience”. You may be feeling open and emotional, willing to share your thoughts and feelings, but others may not be in that place today or tomorrow. They could dismiss your opinions, something that could lead to hurt feelings. But this changes next week, especially in romance, when the Sun enters Aries on Monday.

"
8113,17 march 2017,virgo,"Think twice before entering into any kind of major agreement: buying a home, getting married or joining forces with a business partner, as examples. With long-term Saturn in one of the sectors that deals with emotional security, you need to know first that the people or deals you’re aligning with are the right ones.

"
8114,18 march 2017,virgo,"Yowza! What a passionate day lies ahead for Virgos, as love planet Venus meets up with communicative Mercury ion the house of libido and intimacy. This weekend is custom made for canoodling behind closed doors, not to mention sharing some of your deepest thoughts. Singles, your chances of meeting someone who qualifies as a soulmate are excellent once the Sun changes signs on Monday.

"
8115,19 march 2017,virgo,"Drawing a line in the sand may be necessary as this week brings some tense aspects. Unless you want to get pulled into the dramas that other people create, or their agendas, you either need to step away quietly or tell them to back off. With strict Saturn trying to protect your emotional state, this shouldn’t be as difficult as it might sound.

"
8116,20 march 2017,virgo,"Sometimes we need to clear the cobwebs from our minds and perform some spiritual cleansing. Negative emotions like jealousy and resentment can build up, shutting us down to the people closest to us. But now that the Sun is in Aries you can heal your tired mind and soul. Energy work, mindfulness, meditation–all of these can be of value, along with opening the lines of communication with your loved ones.

"
8117,21 march 2017,virgo,"Frustration may build over a relationship, be it personal or business. You may be anxious to move it along or see improvement in it, but the other party may not be ready yet. From your chart it appears that this will be a seesaw situation over the next few weeks, so learn how to be patient. Bide your time. The new moon on the 28th will help your cause.

"
8118,22 march 2017,virgo,"The details of a financial situation may take some time to work out. Whereas today has good aspects for making progress, the end of the week is mired in red tape and people who can’t agree. Wait until Sunday or Monday, when things may turn around quickly. The new moon on the 28th is your best lunation all year for launching a new, more prosperous chapter.

"
8119,23 march 2017,virgo,"Are you a lover or a fighter? You may have to choose today as the heavens produce a tense Pluto-Mercury aspect. Emotions and harsh words could flow between you and your amour, kids or even someone at work, especially if you’re in the creative field. Take a deep breath and count to ten, as this negative energy continues into tomorrow. Don’t say or do anything you’ll regret. The good news is that things improve on Saturday and get even better by Tuesday’s new moon.

"
8120,24 march 2017,virgo,"Keep your credit cards locked up today, Virgo! A tense Mercury-Jupiter face-off could make your eyes bigger than your wallet. The same holds true for borrowing large amounts of money, say for a house or car. Be conservative when making financial decisions, from the smallest to the biggest. This is no time for rose colored glasses.

"
8121,25 march 2017,virgo,"Pull down the shades and lower the lights! A sexy Venus-Sun connection in your house of sexuality and intimacy makes for one romantic weekend. If you’re single with no hot prospects in sight, don’t despair. Tuesday’s new moon in Aries is your ticket for meeting a companion who will be more than just someone to date. We’re talking soulmate material here. Over the next six months you could meet someone who breaks the mold.

"
8122,27 march 2017,virgo,"What many people don’t know is that love planet Venus also governs profits. Well, Virgo, the golden gal is smiling today as she tries to show you the money and we’re not talking about chump change here. What’s even better is that Venus is the planet of ease, so solidifying your financial base may not be as difficult as you might expect.

"
8123,28 march 2017,virgo,"A highly romantic time can begin in your life, thanks to a sweet new moon in your house of intimacy and bonding. Love planet Venus is in an excellent angle to the Moon, helping singles find a soulmate and attached Virgos to deepen their bond. With Mars in your mind-expanding and adventurous ninth house, you might be willing to date a completely different type or become more open and vulnerable with your amour.

"
8124,29 march 2017,virgo,"If boundaries need to be set with loved ones, today’s a good time to have that conversation. With disciplinarian Saturn in a good spot you can get your point across with both firmness and kindness. You weren’t put on this planet to be the family maid or work horse; others need to pick up some slack.

"
8125,30 march 2017,virgo,"Remember this: you are the captain of your own ship. You are in control of your thoughts, emotions and destiny. No one else. This will become apparent as a tense Jupiter-Pluto square could bring about a conflict in which someone tries to push you into doing something their way. You don’t need to be a pawn, a servant or codependent. Stand up for your ideas, rights and your future path.

"
8126,31 march 2017,virgo,"“Adventure is my middle name.” It’s time to take on a more out-there persona, Virgo, thanks to Mercury entering your expansive ninth house. Why spend your life coloring within the lines when you can splash bright colors everywhere? Take a few risks, even if they’re small ones. One little adventure will build on another until the point where you look back and realize that you’re in a completely different place.

"
8127,1 april 2017,virgo,"Planetary influences indicate that you may be feeling confined by a relationship, whether it’s a personal or business one. Now that Mercury is in your no-holds-barred house of adventure, you’re ready to rock and roll—but is someone or something holding you back? Consider if any changes need to be made, then make them. Once Venus resumes direct motion on the 15th momentum will build.

"
8128,2 april 2017,virgo,"Hmm…does this relationship need an upgrade? Serious partnerships, in love as well as business, are under a magnifying glass until the 15th as Venus retrogrades in this sector. If you haven’t been happy with the ways things have been going, now is the time to speak up and try to make some progress. Next week’s full moon falls in your house of stability. If you want more of it, you’re going to have to demand it.

"
8129,3 april 2017,virgo,"Team efforts get a boost today with a Moon-Neptune connection. Whether you’re planning a family reunion or world domination with a killer new business, creative Neptune will provide you with plenty of inspiration. Trouble is, the authoritative Sun is standing off to the side, questioning the budget of this venture. Make sure the money is there.

"
8130,4 april 2017,virgo,"Your heart may be in the right place but you run the risk of making promises you can’t fulfill. Or, you’re dreaming way too big for your current budget. In any case you need to take a step back for a reality check. Planetary aspects over the next week will yank you down to Earth with a thud otherwise, especially next Tuesday’s full moon in your income sector.

"
8131,5 april 2017,virgo,"Make an effort to reach out to people you’ve fallen out of touch with, Virgo. It’s possible under current planetary influences to start afresh with them. You’ve changed recently as a person, and this will be apparent when you open up the lines of communication with others.

"
8132,6 april 2017,virgo,"Family and housing issues may hit some snags over the next five months as Saturn begins its annual slowdown. Selling a house, getting pregnant, resolving problems with your parents, moving in with your lover—all of these matters could get delayed as the ringed planet retrogrades. Believe it or not though, this could be beneficial. Saturn is the planet of maturity, logical planning and the long term. You now have the opportunity to think things through and do them right.

"
8133,7 april 2017,virgo,"Abundant Jupiter is traveling through your income sector, which should  be a blessing when it coms to earning and saving more. The problem is that Jupiter’s optimism can sometimes lead to rose-colored glasses thinking, which is the issue today. Don’t kid yourself about a raise, job opportunity or revenue stream. It’s not they’re not going to pay off—they can, but you shouldn’t be spending the money before you earn it.

"
8134,8 april 2017,virgo,"This could be an emotional weekend as not one but two squares create friction in close relationships. You may be asking for answers or guarantees from someone that they’re not ready or willing to provide. With two stern planets involved—Pluto and Saturn—things could get forceful. Wait for Tuesday’s full moon to lay down some new rules and expectations.

"
8135,9 april 2017,virgo,"Mercury goes retrograde today and of all the signs you need to be double checking travel plans and contracts! That’s because the messenger planet is perched in your ninth house of legal matters and long distance travel. This is also the sector of education, so make sure term papers and theses absolutely sparkle. The same holds true for any documents that need to be filled out for a governmental agency, such as your citizenship papers or motor vehicle papers. The good news? This is over by the 20th.

"
8136,10 april 2017,virgo,"Initiatives that you start up over the next few months could pay off handsomely, Virgo, but don’t count your chickens before they hatch. Keep projects on task and more importantly, on budget. And if you need to polish up your skills by taking a class or working with a mentor, do so.

"
8137,11 april 2017,virgo,"Abundant Jupiter has been in your income sector since October, and the effort you’ve been putting in is about to pay off. The full moon in the same house could usher in a promotion, raise, new job or deep pocketed client. However, with Pluto in a tough spot from your house of swag and luxury items, you may be tempted to treat yourself to some pricey goodies. Don’t–at least not yet. You need to sock away more in savings before you can spend.

"
8138,12 april 2017,virgo,"Need to mend fences or have a serious conversation with someone close? Then today’s the day, as a helpful Moon-Neptune trine will enable you to speak with passion and clarity. This holds true for business contacts as well as personal ones. You’ll be able to make even more progress after Saturday when Venus resumes direct motion.

"
8139,13 april 2017,virgo,"Put an end to petty arguments today. This holds true for all the people in your life, but especially with a lover. You don’t have to twist someone’s arm to get your point across. With the emotional Moon in a good spot your words will quietly speak for themselves.

"
8140,14 april 2017,virgo,"Spontaneity can be a good thing…or it can lead to problems! Unpredictable Uranus meets up with the Sun today in your wealth sector, indicating that an opportunity to improve your finances could be around the corner. But the key is to make sure you have all the facts and know whom you’re dealing with first. Jumping into a “surefire thing” too quickly could have the opposite effect.

"
8141,14 april 2016,virgo,"Over the next few days a number of sparkling aspects are going to help you ditch drama, resentment and all the other ugly emotions that we humans cook up. So if there has been any bad mojo surrounding your relationship with a lover or kids, start patching things up today. You’ll be glad you did.

"
8142,15 april 2017,virgo,"Phew. Venus, planet of amour, finally goes direct in your commitment sector after spinning backwards for over a month. This hasn’t been an easy placement for you as it has most likely tested your union. Singles may have felt as though they were walking through the desert with nary a potential mate in sight. And to top it off, an ex may have appeared back on the scene! Things calm down and become more clear, and once the Sun enters Taurus on the 19th, more fun.

"
8143,16 april 2017,virgo,"It’s time to take a gamble in life, Virgo, whether it’s with a love connection, a business venture or traveling around the world. The next four weeks are perfect for initiating big changes, and a Mars-Venus aspect today will help you start daydreaming and planning. If you’ve been putting too many things off, waiting for “someday”….well, someday is here. Now.

"
8144,17 april 2017,virgo,"If you’re seeking more stability with your finances or love life–or both–a helpful Sun-Saturn aspect smooths the way. Solutions to problems will arise, you’ll be able to speak more openly with people and a sense of balance will start to develop. But nothing will happen unless you take action, so start thinking and communicating.

"
8145,18 april 2017,virgo,"Button pusher alert! Someone close may try to rile you up today and it’s your job to remain calm. When Pluto begins to retrograde on Thursday you’ll have five months to examine your emotions, such as jealousy, fear and resentment. If you’re too quick to give up your power to others, or you easily get pulled into dramas that you’d be better off avoiding, then the cosmos is going to help you develop more sang froid  (which is French for being really chill).

"
8146,19 april 2017,virgo,"Ain’t nothin’ holding you back now that the Sun is in your house of adventure! Or–is there? Loved ones may be tugging at you in the weeks ahead, demanding attention and maybe even playing head games. If you want to make the most of this positive solar energy, you may need to point out to others that you do have limits–and they’re pushing them.

"
8147,20 april 2017,virgo,"If drama is not your thing you’re going to have to work hard to avoid it over the next few months, Virgo. That’s because Pluto begins to retrograde in your fifth house of romance and close connections. Exes may return, jealousy and obsession could spike and you may be looking for trouble. Or—not. The choice is yours to make.

"
8148,21 april 2017,virgo,"Lucky you—ambitious Mars is now in your house of….ambition! This is its first visit to this part of your chart in two years, so you’re now in an awesome position to make progress with any goal of your choosing. Helping you along is Pluto, which went retrograde yesterday in your creativity sector. Tap into the wellspring of talent and inspiration that we all have and dig deep. You may end up realizing that there are better, more cutting edge ways to go about your plans.

"
8149,22 april 2017,virgo,"Romance needs a reality check with a stern Venus-Saturn square. Don’t kid yourself—if you’re in a relationship with too much drama, not enough communication and a lot of doubts, you need to do some reflecting. Saturn is the planet of long-term stability and it happens to be in your house of romance. Like a kindly grandfather, he wants you to be in only the very best relationship. Try to work things out or move on.

"
8150,23 april 2017,virgo,"Matters of the heart could be touchy these days, courtesy of both Mercury and Pluto going retrograde in your romance sectors this past Thursday. But today is a bright spot as the Moon and love planet meet up, allowing you to speak your mind with a loved one. Sometimes the best way to communicate is to just spend some quality time together, alone. Head out to a park, museum or the beach and let your hair down.

"
8151,24 april 2017,virgo,"This is no time for flings or relationships that are flimsy. Nor is it wise to hook up with a sexy but untrustworthy ex who may come sniffing around, a possibility with Mercury retrograde in your house of sex and intimacy. Nope, the cosmos wants you to find the real deal or make an existing relationship stronger. Today’s powerful Mercury-Saturn trine can make it happen.

"
8152,25 april 2017,virgo,"Let it flow! Allowing yourself to be more vulnerable with the people you love is advised with a happy Uranus-Saturn trine, the best possible aspect in astrology. If you’re used to keeping a stiff upper lip when it comes to managing your emotions with family members or a lover, it’s time to speak up. They need to know your thoughts and feelings. Being a martyr doesn’t serve anyone.

"
8153,26 april 2017,virgo,"Hiding in the shadows while you watch everyone else have a life? I don’t think so! The new moon in Taurus occurs in the most expansive part of your chart, telling you to start taking more chances—in love, career choices, travel, education, and your overall lifestyle. If some of your dreams cost money, then Venus’s move on Friday will help you develop the cash to fund them.

"
8154,26 april 2016,virgo,"Romance heats up big time with libidinous Mars meeting up with with swaggering Pluto. Flirting, canoodling, bodice-ripping action in the boudoir: yup, it’s all in the stars! Your judgment could be a bit muddled, though, so look before you leap (or tear your clothes off).

"
8155,27 april 2017,virgo,"Letting someone else control your love life isn’t the way to go, Virgo. If you’ve been stifling your opinions and feelings it’s time to let them loose. Singles, you need be more outspoken about what you want out of love. Get clear on that now so when the time comes that a new love enters your life, you’re ready to determine if they have what it takes.

"
8156,28 april 2017,virgo,"Reaching a deeper level of emotional and sexual intimacy is possible, thanks to magnetic Venus entering your house of bonding. Now is the time to work out issues, as Venus’s presence will allow progress to be made without a lot of drama. Singles, a soulmate is out there for you, not a fling. Raise your standards and start hunting while the planets are in your favor.

"
8157,29 april 2017,virgo,"Stop taking your job or business home with you, Virgo. Whether you’re spending time on the weekend actually doing work, or the stress is hanging over your head like a dark rain cloud, it’s gotta go. The recent new moon fell in your house of adventure and trying new things. It’s Saturday, babe. Get out there and enjoy life!

"
8158,30 april 2017,virgo,"This is the perfect weekend for planning a rager of a party, a family vacation, church bake sale, charity gala or industry get together. The power is with the people, the more the merrier. Seek the advice and companionship of others, as they are going to be a big part of your happiness and success in the weeks and months to come.

"
8159,1 may 2017,virgo,"You may need to come down hard on someone today, but there’s no need to completely freak out. Mercury’s retrograde, stirring up your emotions. While the other party may deserve your annoyance, you run the risk of being way too emo. Things will start to smooth over once the messenger planet goes direct on Wednesday.

"
8160,2 may 2017,virgo,"Shhh! Whatever schemes you’re dreaming up, keep ‘em on the downlow as the mysterious Moon urges caution. All 537 of your Facebook friends don’t need to know that you just met a hottie or you’re thinking of leaving your job. Your colleagues don’t need to hear about how fed up you are. Want to see some changes? Then go into secret agent mode and move on.

"
8161,3 may 2017,virgo,"Romantic relationships start to become more relaxed and even more libidinous as Mercury goes direct in the house of intimacy. The past few weeks may have been testy, full of drama and unpleasant emotions. Trust issues, jealousy, snooping…yuk. The good news is that it’s over (or it should be!). Singles, you’re in a sweet spot to meet a sexy new soulmate.

"
8162,4 may 2017,virgo,"Your sign always takes the heat for being so damn practical, so much so that people don’t always realize that there’s a fun-loving, sexy individual hiding behind that efficient exterior. Well Virgo, it’s time to let your inner hedonistic self come out and play. A sizzling Sun-Neptune aspect helps kick open the doors to Playland. Run through and have a good time.

"
8163,5 may 2017,virgo,"Thinking about going global with a business, or at least nationwide? Thinking about expanding your brand’s reach via social media? Ready to plunge into a new income stream, or perhaps even a different occupation altogether? Then start doing some research, Virgo. The Sun is currently in the most mind-expanding part of your chart, encouraging you to think big and bold. The full moon on the 10th is perfect for getting down to brass tacks and hammering out a strategy.

"
8164,6 may 2017,virgo,"The Moon in your sign might make you feel territorial, as though you need to protect your “turf”, whatever that might be: your opinions, your space, freedom, time, job, relationships, and so on. The reality is that although there may  be people around you who are trying to get their way, you may be getting over emotional about it. That’s because next week’s full moon occurs in one of the most passionate parts of your chart. Relax and inject some logic into your attitude.

"
8165,7 may 2017,virgo,"You’re in luck on the money front as abundant Jupiter has your back until the fall. Today it meets up with the vibey Moon, helping you get in touch with your true career passion. If you’re not thrilled with the line of work that you’re in it may be time to make some changes. But you need to closely consider whether partnering with others is a smart bet or not, as murky Neptune will retrograde in June in the business alliance part of your chart.

"
8166,8 may 2017,virgo,"Hold on to your wallet this week, Virgo, as pricey baubles, designer duds and shiny new electronics may be calling your name—not to mention posh vacations, dream houses and sexy sports cars. Your savings don’t seem to match your dreams, at least not right now. Logical Mercury encourages you to sock away more cash in retirement accounts and other safe investments rather than impulse purchases.

"
8167,9 may 2017,virgo,"If there was ever a time to get in touch with who you really are it’s now, Virgo! A fabulous Sun-Pluto trine allows you to get in touch with your “authentic self” and let the world know all about it. Stop playing roles that have run their course—the dutiful daughter, the soccer mom or dad, the responsible corporate slug. No one is telling you to misbehave, however! This is more about letting other aspects of your personality shine. We’re multi-faceted creatures, we humans: why stick with just one image?

"
8168,10 may 2017,virgo,"Something significant may come to pass in the near future, something that you may have been working on (or praying for!) for some time. Tonight’s full moon takes place in your house of communication, so there could be some happy news on the way. It could be about love or starting a family, with Pluto sending shimmering beams from this part of your chart. It could be about money (the big kind) thanks to Uranus in fine form in your house of wealth. Going back to school, traveling, landing book deals, getting licensed—all of these are possible due to the location of the Sun. Want to start something in one of these areas? That’s well aspected too, so get moving.

"
8169,11 may 2017,virgo,"Wonky day in the cosmos with aggressive Mars squaring deceptive Neptune. You  may be on task, willing to do whatever it takes to get something done, but others around you could be slacking or worse—deliberately throwing a monkey wrench into the proceedings in an attempt to slow things down. Chances are you won’t get a straight answer from them so don’t bother putting anyone on the spot. You’re on a roll, so keep the momentum going and don’t let their games slow your progress.

"
8170,12 may 2017,virgo,"You should be beyond motivated, thanks to assertive Mars blazing a path through the most ambitious part of your chart. And today the red planet forms a magnificent trine with abundant Jupiter. The message from the cosmos? Don’t hold back! Seriously, your goals or plans may be a wee bit small. If there was ever a time to think in broader brushstrokes it’s now, Virgo. There’s a strong profit potential considering that Jupiter’s in your earnings sector, so if one of your desires is to earn more this is a good time to go after the green.

"
8171,13 may 2017,virgo,"Risk versus comfort: it’s a battle we all have to deal with, regardless of our zodiac sign. But today the cosmos asks Virgos to consider how much you’re willing to put yourself on the line. With stern Saturn in your stable fourth house of emotional security you may be looking for guarantees, not challenges. But with the Sun in the most adventurous part of your chart, it may be time to change up your life in a few ways, even if they’re small.

"
8172,14 may 2017,virgo,"What you think turns into what you say and the tone in which you say it. Are you expressing yourself in the very best way possible, Virgo? Naturally you’re going to speak to your kids differently than the way you’d talk to a client, but the cosmos is suggesting that you switch up your methods. A helpful Neptune-Jupiter aspect will enable you to think more creatively about the best way to self-express. This goes for written work and artistic endeavors too, so let the inspiration flow.

"
8173,15 may 2017,virgo,"Get in touch with your inner DaVinci or Mozart. Or perhaps you want to have moves like Jagger. Do you want to dress with as much creativity and flamboyance as Frida Kahlo? Maybe Georgia O’Keeffe’s minimalist, almost monastic style would work for you better. The cosmos tells you to become more of an artiste  in your daily life, regardless as to whether you’re a soccer mom or a corporate CEO.

"
8174,16 may 2017,virgo,"Visionary! That’s what people will be saying about you now that Mercury is in the most worldly, mind-expanding part of your chart. Don’t be surprised if you start craving more opportunities to grow as a human being, whether it’s through your career, love, education or travel. When the Sun enters your ambition and success sector this Saturday, you can take that vision and apply it to your plans. This is no time for thinking small.

"
8175,17 may 2017,virgo,"Your desk and to-do list seem to be piling up with activities, and if you try to do them all you’ll end up feeling overwhelmed. Fortunately a productive Moon-Jupiter meeting will inspire you to prioritize what needs to be done so that you can sail through your day efficiently. Becoming more productive doesn’t have to be as painful as getting a root canal.

"
8176,18 may 2017,virgo,"Love. sex and money: always an interesting combination. And today, the two planets that govern profits, Venus and Jupiter, are in a cranky mood. Which means: keep the plastic in your wallet. Think before you sign on the dotted line for that big mortgage or car payment. Venus is in one of the romance sectors, so you may also find it difficult to communicate with a lover. Either that, or someone is playing you with so much attention and flattery that you may be suspicious of their motives. Tread warily in matters of the heart and finance over the next few days!

"
8177,19 may 2017,virgo,"Ggrrrrr, tiger! Spontaneous Uranus is acting up (in a good way) in your sexy eighth house of libido and intimacy, telling you to loosen up the strings on that bodice of yours and get your groove back. Serious Saturn has been making you crave comfort and security in love over the past two years, but today maverick Uranus suggests to make your life a lot juicier! This isn’t a flash in the pan either: this energy continues all the way into November. So bring sexy back.

"
8178,20 may 2017,virgo,"No one can accuse your sign of being a group of slackers, and now that the Sun is in Gemini you can really put the pedal to the metal. Gemini is your tenth house of ambition and success so get ready to plunge into your goals with a fresh new attitude and energy level. The only word of warning is that you’ll need to balance your efforts with some quiet down time for yourself and loved ones. This may really become apparent on the 25th and 29th, as stern Saturn will remind you of your other priorities. Otherwise you’re in a good spot to make progress, especially with brainy Mercury in your visionary house of taking risks.

"
8179,21 may 2017,virgo,"The next two days can be highly cathartic if you allow them to be. With the Moon in Aries, your eighth house of deep emotions and thoughts, it’s possible to get to the root of discontent, jealousy, fears or whatever else may be blocking your progress. Even if you’re not dealing with these emotions it’s still a wonderful time to get in touch with your more spiritual side.

"
8180,22 may 2017,virgo,"Yum! Sexy Venus sidles up to the romantic Moon in your house of libido and intimacy. Who says Mondays are awful? Not if you’re a Virgo! Strut your stuff, you gorgeous thang. You never know who may be looking. And if you’re in a relationship (or just wanna have some fun), this is a good day for canoodling under the covers.

"
8181,23 may 2017,virgo,"Obsessing over your schedule, to-do lists and goals will make for one burned out Virgo. The good news is that go-getter Mars is in your house of ambition. The bad news is that Mars is in your house of ambition! While the red planet can do an awesome job of motivating you, it can also lead to becoming impatient to the point of aggressiveness. In the process you may forget that you have a personal life and loved ones who need some attention. Try to maintain some balance in the weeks ahead.

"
8182,24 may 2017,virgo,"Your emotions toward someone close may be going all over the map this week. Today you may be feeling happy and affectionate, tomorrow resentment or jealousy could be on the menu. It’s time to get a better grip on your feelings, Virgo. And tomorrow’s new moon should help you do the trick as it falls in your confident, authoritative tenth house. If others are running hot and cold with you then you either need to step away or straighten these people out.

"
8183,25 may 2017,virgo,"Feeling more confident and in control? You should be with the new moon occurring in the most authoritative part of your chart. Not only can you put a lot of energy into making more money or finding a new career, but you’ll also be able to speak your mind when it comes to romance. It’s high time that you stopped resorting to jealousy or mistrust. Feeling comfortable in your own skin is a must if you’re going to take charge of your life.

"
8184,26 may 2017,virgo,"The North Node of the Moon deals with the karmic lessons in life that we are destined to learn, and today the Node is calling your name. It’s situated in the most nurturing, healing part of your chart, helping you release some baggage that needs to go. And this can happen quickly, mind you. Spontaneous Uranus is in a terrific angle today and all weekend, so change could occur more rapidly than you might expect.

"
8185,27 may 2017,virgo,"You’re no longer willing to let other people take control of key relationships, whether it’s at work or your private life. If bosses, clients or colleagues have been yanking you around it’s time to let them know that you’re not their go-to person. The same goes for a lover, family members or your kids. The good news is that you can do this diplomatically. Reaching out to them with both logic and  emotion will work. You’re stepping into a more powerful place and your self-esteem will grow as a result.

"
8186,28 may 2017,virgo,"It’s a good day to speak your mind, and the people in your circle should be open to what you have to say. Considering entering into a new relationship, whether it’s a romantic one or for business? New connections are highly favored for you right now, so keep an open mind about fresh alliances.

"
8187,29 may 2017,virgo,"You haven’t been feeling too footloose and fancy free lately,  not with so much cosmic emphasis on getting things done (and we’re talking about the big stuff here, not your food shopping). It might all start catching up with you courtesy of a tense Saturn-Mars smackdown in the heavens. If you need some down time, take it Virgo. Do it now before you go off the deep end! The good news is that aspects for the rest of the week are designed to bring more fun into your life.

"
8188,30 may 2017,virgo,"A surprising source of income or cash could come your way, and you’d be wise to take a good look at it. Whether it’s a job offer, a passive income stream or an idea you have for an invention or business you could really score some nice bucks down the road. A visionary aspect tomorrow is just the ticket for exploring your options.

"
8189,31 may 2017,virgo,"While you can usually impress people with your pragmatic attitude, now’s the time to dazzle others with creativity. A sparkling Mercury-Pluto trine in the most free-spirited parts of your chart allows you to dig deep into that well of innovative thoughts that resides within you and pull out some gems.

"
8190,1 june 2017,virgo,"Getting clear about your feelings becomes easier, thanks to gentle Venus helping you from your house of deep emotions. Saturn adds a stabilizing effect, ensuring that you maturely move past old feelings of jealousy, fear and resentment. If you need to open up to someone close, such as a lover or family member, now is the time to do so. Next week’s full moon on the 9th is designed to bring you a greater sense of confidence and serenity, but why wait till then to feel that way?

"
8191,1 june 2016,virgo,"Creative differences? Tension could build today between you and a business associate. The Sun in your career house is firing you up to move onward and upward, but there may be some differences of opinion that have to be resolved first. A romantic partner may also not share your vision. This energy will build as Friday approaches and a Grand Cross occurs in the heavens. Don’t expect to resolve this today!

"
8192,2 june 2017,virgo,"Gotta love it! The two most optimistic orbs in the solar system, Jupiter and the Sun, are forming a trine today, which is one of the best aspects possible. Your desire to turn your ideas into reality should ramp up considerably. Instead of feeling, “Oh my God, I have  to plough through this grunt work”, you should feel excited about diving into your plans. Just don’t forget to leave some quality time for yourself.

"
8193,2 june 2016,virgo,"Dreamy Neptune is in fine angle to the Moon, stirring up your passion and desire to have a rewarding romantic relationship. The North Node of the Moon is asking, however, why you feel the need to be stuck—in an unhappy situation, settling for less. If that’s your case, it’s time to do some soul searching and make a decision—do I stay or do I go? Happily involved Virgos could be inspired to take their relationship to higher level. The message from the planets is to move onward and upward, living a bigger and more satisfying life.

"
8194,3 june 2017,virgo,"Bring out the emojis! The usually calm, cool and collected Virgo could turn into a steaming cauldron of bubbling emotions thanks to an energetic and combustible Venus-Uranus connection. All sorts of, uh, interesting  things could happen if your emotions get verbalized. So if you’re angry, resentful or jealous, you could be spewing venom. On the other hand you could unexpectedly spill your desire to make passionate love to someone who’s been on your radar for awhile. If in doubt, keep your lips zipped. Once chatty Mercury enters your authoritative tenth house on Tuesday you’ll be in a better place to vent or pursue your desires.

"
8195,3 june 2016,virgo,"You’ll be ready the throw in the towel and tell everyone around you to figure out their own damn problems by the time today is over, Virgo! A Grand Cross occurs in the heavens, with a bevy of planets opposing each other. It’s you versus your partner, family and employer. Incessant demands from these folks may find you reaching a point in which you say, “Enough!” And you’re right. There’s only so much one person can do. However, matters at the office could start to ease up as early as next Monday, so telling your boss to take his job and stick where the Sun don’t shine won’t be necessary. The smart Virgo chills out over the weekend and takes a cool assessment about who’s being fair and who’s not, which commitments can stay and those that need to go.

"
8196,4 june 2017,virgo,"First the good news: Mars enters your chummy eleventh house of networking, socializing, meeting new people and teamwork. Now for the less than stellar news: Mars can act like a bull in a china shop in whatever house it happens to be in. Which means that team members or friends could slack off, act up, create unnecessary dramas or not play nice in general. Fortunately shrewd Mercury enters your tenth house of maturity and authority on Tuesday. You may end up feeling like the only grown up in a group, but that’s better than being the whining baby.

"
8197,5 june 2017,virgo,"You’re the boss of your own life, which means that your time and commitments are in your control. If others think they have the right to intrude in your decision making process, not to mention disrupt your peace, you need to set them straight. Don’t fall for guilt trips and martyr routines; most of the people around you are quite capable of taking care of themselves.

"
8198,6 june 2017,virgo,"Hmmm, ready to take a risk in romance? Singles, you might entertain a new kind of lover, someone whom you might not have considered in the past. Coupled up Virgos could find themselves seeking adventure by heading off to an exotic vacation destination or taking a class together. How about scuba diving or flamenco dancing? Blame it on amorous Venus, which has just entered your expansive ninth house of free-spirited living. Carpe diem!

"
8199,7 june 2017,virgo,"Your most cherished goals and ambitions get a big boost as quick thinking, rational Mercury joins the Sun in the success sector of your chart. If people or circumstances have been holding you back, you’re now in a visionary enough place to see it. While the Sun can provide you with ambition, Mercury acts like a military general, planning out strategies and the smartest way to get from point A to point B.

"
8200,8 june 2017,virgo,"We all crave security when it comes to love and money. Fortunately the cosmos is trying to provide you with both. You may have to revise the way you’re going about it, though. With tomorrow’s full moon falling in one of the most comfort-driven parts of your chart this is not the time for any risky moves in matters of the heart or finances.

"
8201,9 june 2017,virgo,"The Sagittarius full moon occurs in one of the most nostalgic and homey parts of your chart, Virgo. Don’t be surprised if you’re pulling out old family albums or sharing stories with your siblings about “back in the day”. You might also be wrapping up a major home-related project, such as decorating or planting your garden. With stable Saturn, the planet of long-term planning, in a good angle any major decisions you make should be good ones: buying a house, having a baby or bringing your parents to live with you.

"
8202,10 june 2017,virgo,"Sweet! Lucky Jupiter finally resumes direct motion after a four-month retrograde. Last fall this abundant planet entered your income sector for the first time in 13 years, a boon for pulling in more cash and saving it. However, progress may have stalled back in early February when the gas giant started moving backward in the heavens. Now that it’s back in action so should you be! You have through October 10th to hustle, so make sure that every day counts.

"
8203,11 june 2017,virgo,"Great day for opening up and being vulnerable with the people you love. Erratic Uranus could open up the floodgates, so get ready to speak your mind. Get things off your chest before Neptune retrogrades on Friday.

"
8204,12 june 2017,virgo,"This is one heck of a day to further your ambitions, whatever they might be, as long as you’re going things alone! Some tough planetary aspects over the next few weeks indicate that partnering with others may not be in your best interests. So—do your morning exercise routine without relying on an exercise buddy to motivate you. Think twice before taking on a business partner. Rely on your own judgment. Even if you seek the wisdom of an expert, let the final decision be your own.

"
8205,13 june 2017,virgo,"People may be hard to pin down today courtesy of a tough Neptune-Mercury square. Watch out for obfuscation, foot dragging, excuses and “poor little me” routines. Fortunately, Mars is in your friendly eleventh house, so you probably won’t take it personally. However, if someone gets too out of hand, call them on it.

"
8206,14 june 2017,virgo,"Division of labor: it’s a beautiful thing! This is a nice way of saying that you shouldn’t be the office workhouse or the maid at home. Today’s a good time to delegate tasks and put people (politely) on notice that you have expectations of them. Don’t expect them to like it, though. Tomorrow there could be pushback, so get ready to stand your ground.

"
8207,15 june 2017,virgo,"With the Sun in the most ambitious part of your chart, you’re in no mood for other people slowing you down—but that may exactly what’s happening right now. A Sun-Saturn smackdown could find you setting boundaries with people who are demanding too much of your time and attention. One caveat, however: don’t become so focused on your goals that you neglect spending quality time with the people you care about.

"
8208,16 june 2017,virgo,"Between now and late November you may wonder of you’re better off doing things by yourself, Virgo. That’s because Neptune begins to retrograde in your partnership sector, causing people to slack or be indirect with their words and behavior. This includes both personal and business relationships. Don’t get stuck doing all of the grunt work! Singles, you may feel like taking a break from the dating scene. That’s OK—pamper yourself instead!

"
8209,17 june 2017,virgo,"Let freedom ring? The Liberty Bell may be clanging for you, Virgo, as planets in your friendly eleventh house are pushing you out the door and into some nice social situations. The only issue is that you may realize that you could use some space from a lover or other people who are close to you. There’s nothing wrong with having your own life.

"
8210,18 june 2017,virgo,"This week an opportunity to make more money, either through a job or some kind of passive income investment, could come your way, and it may happen quickly. Likewise you might stumble upon a genius idea for earning more. With the Sun about to enter Cancer midweek, your smartest move is to seek the advice of a mentor or close confidante who can guide you in the right direction.

"
8211,19 june 2017,virgo,"A power struggle could erupt as people around you are determined to get their way. Problem is, so are you! With intelligent Mercury in the most authoritative part of your chart, you shouldn’t hold back your opinion. You may be the only grown-up in the room, but that’s too bad–let the others deal with it.

"
8212,20 june 2017,virgo,"Increasing your net worth will be on your mind today, and fortunately for you the planet of genius is in fine form. Innovative Uranus could spur your imagination to come up with a money-making idea—a patent, side business, passive income stream or just a better place to invest the money you’ve already saved. Seek advice before you plunge in; tomorrow the Sun enters your house of mentors and coaches.

"
8213,21 june 2017,virgo,"The words “mastermind group” are tossed around a lot these days, but you would be wise to consider being a member of one. Today both the mighty Sun and intelligent Mercury enter your house of networking, making this one of the best times in years to join forces with others. Don’t feel like being part of a think tank? Then join a singles group or a local charity. Become part of a running club or the PTO. Get involved at your church or start a book club. Enjoy!

"
8214,22 june 2017,virgo,"Your friends and acquaintances will become a much bigger part of your life in the weeks ahead, and so they should. The Sun and Mercury entered your networking zone yesterday, and the company you keep can change your circumstances dramatically. Ask your pals to play matchmaker, help you with a business idea, join you in a charitable venture, and simply get together to have some fun.

"
8215,23 june 2017,virgo,"It’s time to get serious about what you want out of life rather than talking and thinking about it. Tomorrow’s new moon falls in your house of deeply held dreams and wishes, so get clear about them and then decide to do  something.

"
8216,24 june 2017,virgo,"A people-centric new moon occurs today, a special time for Virgos to make social plans with their existing friends—and to make some new ones along the way. As a matter of fact, the planets are lining up in such a way that you’re encouraged to start traveling more with a lover and/or your pals. Who knows whom you might meet while on holiday?

"
8217,25 june 2017,virgo,"First, the good news: the recent new moon in your house of dearly held dreams is kicking off a six-month phase in which you can pursue them. Now for the “pay attention” part of this message: you may end up being overwhelmed by either too may choices, or too may people providing you with their input. While it’s a wise move to seek advice right now, it’s not the time for making decisions. Slow down and take things one step at a time.

"
8218,26 june 2017,virgo,"This is a superb week for forging new partnerships with people in all areas of your life. Whether you’re looking for love, interested in joining a volunteer group or want to create an industry mastermind meet up, it’s green lights ahead. Business partnerships are also highly favored; two (or more!) heads are better than one right now.

"
8219,27 june 2017,virgo,"Getting on the same page with people is essential. You’re going to need their support in the months ahead, but with murky Neptune retrograde in your partnership zone, it may be hard to come to an agreement. Fortunately the next 48 hours bring aspects that will enable you to make things clear to everyone involved. You may need to push a little harder than you’d like, but if you don’t nothing will get done.

"
8220,27 june 2016,virgo,"Got love on your mind? With the two most romantic planets in the cosmos in a perfect angle, your plans can bolt forward. We’re talking serious plans here, not the little stuff! With Mercury entering your hopes and wishes sector, and Mars going direct in your house of communication, it’s the perfect moment to share your thoughts with an amour (and that includes hot new prospects).

"
8221,28 june 2017,virgo,"If there is absolutely one thing you need to do today, it’s to reach out and connect with someone. Better yet, connect with as many people as possible! Network your little Virgo a** off, as motivational Mars and chatty Mercury are meeting up in your house of socializing. Whether you do so to find new love, a higher paying job or just for the joy of being around like minded people, you need to develop strong ties.

"
8222,28 june 2016,virgo,"Alone with your thoughts? The Moon is leading you into deep reflection, helping you plan the next step ahead on your path through life. As this is a positive placement, you can come to realizations that are quite powerful. But a Pluto square indicates that you may not be willing to share your ideas with your lover. Sometimes you need time to think alone.

"
8223,29 june 2017,virgo,"On the same page? It may not feel like it as Pluto faces off against Mercury in the heavens. This could happen with a lover, a friend, a team you’re involved with (like a charity) or a group at the office. There could be a difference in values or the creative direction that you’re all heading in. The good news is that you’re diplomacy skills are high, so remain patient and wait for a better day to make progress.

"
8224,29 june 2016,virgo,"Sometimes even the happiest of romantic relationships can hit the doldrums, but today’s planetary aspects are designed to shake you out of a funk. As the Moon conjuncts surprise-a-minute Uranus, you may experience a realization that you need something more: more excitement in love, better sex, more quality time, a different type of lover, less drama. Whatever it is, honor it–and make it happen.

"
8225,30 june 2017,virgo,"You’re such a self starter that it may be inconceivable to you that others just can’t get their s*** together. And that’s what you’ll be dealing with over the next week–people who need to be reined in, motivated or reminded what their responsibilities are. This is just as true of your personal life as in business, so get ready to whip people into shape.

"
8226,30 june 2016,virgo,"At cross purposes? You and a lover may not be on the same page when it comes to future plans. Don’t be driven to keep up with your friends. Just because your pals may be all heading down the aisle and having babies doesn’t mean that you need to be in a rush. Likewise, all committed relationships go through rough patches. If that’s your situation, let it pass. Neptune in retrograde can be causing confusion in romance.

"
8227,1 july 2017,virgo,"Money matters can be discussed with greater ease, courtesy of a positive lunar aspect. Inspiration for earning more will also flow your way thanks to Neptune in a generous mood. Chances are, though, that increasing your net worth will require teaming up with someone–a business partner, a financial advisor–so consider whom you should speak with.

"
8228,1 july 2016,virgo,"What a wonderful day in the cosmos! The two most upbeat planets in our solar system are teaming up to help us, and in your case Venus is pushing you to go after your dreams. Lucky and generous Jupiter will provide you with the courage and savoir faire to pull them off. But chances are this won’t be a solo project– a friend or acquaintance could be instrumental in your future success and happiness.

"
8229,2 july 2017,virgo,"Sitting back and smiling while someone hands you a bunch of bulls*** is never easy….so why are you doing that? A tense Mars-Pluto opposition today may find you getting fed up with being at the receiving end of other people’s nonsense. There’s no need to explode, however–once gentle Venus enters Gemini on the 4th, you’ll be able to respond with calm authority.

"
8230,2 july 2016,virgo,"It’s time to reassess a family or housing situation, as serious Saturn is trying to bring stability to this part of your life. You may need to scale back (temporarily, at least) some of your bigger plans, such as having another child, buying a vacation home or moving across country. This vibe reappears several times in the first two weeks of July, so expect to have some conversations with your loved ones about these topics.

"
8231,3 july 2017,virgo,"Forgiving and forgetting what others have done is important right now, Virgo. It doesn’t really matter who’s right and who’s wrong; what counts is your peace of mind. You need a break from drama, which means that you need to simply let go.

"
8232,3 july 2016,virgo,"If there has been confusion in a romantic matter, today the fog will clear. That’s because the fiery Sun meets up with misty Neptune in a glorious angle, helping you get a handle on matters of the heart. Even if you’re single, you will be able to sort out the kind of long lasting partnership you want in the future.

"
8233,4 july 2017,virgo,"Sometimes pursuing our dreams feels about as pleasant as getting a root canal. And if that’s been the case for you, Virgo, good news! Easy-going Venus just glided into your house of ambition where it will stay until the 31st. It’s possible that suddenly, the right people and circumstances show up at just the right time. Synchronicity is a beautiful thing–keep your eyes open for it!

"
8234,4 july 2016,virgo,"Ready for some fresh new faces to come into your life? Today’s new moon in your convivial house of networking means that you’re about to expand your social and business circle. With romantic Neptune active, chances are good that your love life is about to take a big leap forward. The next six months will introduce you to an exciting new group of people.

"
8235,5 july 2017,virgo,"Now that left-brain Mercury is now in your right-brain twelfth house, it’s time to stop being so obsessed with to-do lists, budgets and efficiency. If anything now is a good time to meditate, get involved with hobbies and just relax with a good book.

"
8236,5 july 2016,virgo,"Yesterday’s new moon in your networking sector suggests that two heads are better than one, and today is excellent for reaching out to potential partners. Hooking up with a team of like-minded people who have knowledge to share can help expand your own thinking.

"
8237,6 july 2017,virgo,"You may think that you know the smartest way to proceed with an issue–and indeed you could be right–but that doesn’t mean that the team will be willing to go along with your ideas. A Sun-Jupiter square today means that the consensus of the group comes before the smarts of one individual. Suck it up and go along with it, at least for now.

"
8238,6 july 2016,virgo,"Communication between you and acquaintances could be a bit bumpy over the next few days. Today is superb for talking with friends and networking with folks in social, business and charitable arenas. But tomorrow is another story, as opposing planets make things tense in the romance department. Your best bet is to tiptoe around your lover until the weekend, when sanity returns.

"
8239,7 july 2017,virgo,"If your career, love life or big plans are no longer working for you, it’s time for some reflection. That should be easy with intelligent Mercury in the confidential house of the quiet mind. It signals sweet Venus in your ambition sector. With tomorrow’s full moon in your house of living la vida loca, don’t be surprised if you’re ready to bust out of a rut!

"
8240,7 july 2016,virgo,"Is it time to look out for #1? Your needs and wishes are pitted against those of your friends, lovers and even groups that you’re involved in. Planetary aspects indicate that you have some pretty interesting, even lofty goals and wishes, but the people around you aren’t in agreement. Tomorrow’s aspects are better, helping you crystallize your plans. Whether your acquaintances go along for the ride is up to you.

"
8241,8 july 2017,virgo,"If life has seemed a little dull lately, tonight’s full moon will put some sparkle back into it. That’s because it takes place in your frothy, festive sector of enjoying life. Don’t think that it’s frivolous to want to play–you deserve it.

"
8242,8 july 2016,virgo,"If you can dream it, you can do it. That’s the message that the cosmos has for you, Virgo, and you’d be smart to run with it. Planet of luck Jupiter is active in your sign and is encouraging you to think big. Over the next few days really think about where you’d like to go next in your life, then write it down in detail. Helping you is energetic Mars in your house of intelligence and documentation.

"
8243,9 july 2017,virgo,"Despite your desire to relate with someone, they might not be open to it. This can be true even of close friends or people you’ve known for years. There’s an undercurrent of rivalry going on, or an unwillingness to cooperate. It will ebb and flow over the next two weeks, but once the 20th rolls around, you’ll be able to put your finger on what’s going on.

"
8244,9 july 2016,virgo,"Impressive! The cosmos is green-lighting your desire to make a positive impact on the world. A conjunction between the nurturing Moon and blessed Jupiter means that you can also learn how to take excellent care of yourself. Strong self-esteem leads to charisma.

"
8245,10 july 2017,virgo,"Tread warily in the internet or electronic world today! A tough standoff involving the Sun and Pluto could find you going into rant mode or sending an angry e-mail to the wrong person. Mercury isn’t retrograde, but aggressive Mars is in your tech sector and is raring to pick a fight. This sector also governs friends and colleagues, so you need to be diplomatic with them as well.

"
8246,10 july 2016,virgo,"Forging dynamic connections is what it’s all about today, Virgo! Enterprising Mars in your social sector is telling you that it’s not only what you know, but who you know. Even the shyest members of your sign will be able to open up and chat with others. Dazzling Jupiter is by your side, helping you expand your tribe and alliances.

"
8247,11 july 2017,virgo,"You may feel as though there are daunting tasks–obstacles, even–in front of you. But a helpful Moon-Jupiter trine will enable you to break them down into manageable chunks. Jupiter is in your house of creating smart routines and stability, so reflect upon what changes you can make to become more efficient.

"
8248,11 july 2016,virgo,"Intense emotions could erupt between you and a friend, and you might be surprised by their remarks. The same holds true for people in a team or group setting whom you’ve been working with. Considering that intelligent Mercury will be sliding into your highly intuitive twelfth house on Wednesday, you’ll be more than able to suss what’s going on behind the scenes.

"
8249,12 july 2017,virgo,"An atmosphere of cooperation arises (at least on your part!) now that the Moon is in your diplomatic seventh house of partnering. Even if others aren’t willing to share, it’s smart to take the high road. You’ll feel proud obour how you’ve conducted yourself, and that’s a feeling that no one can take away from you.

"
8250,12 july 2016,virgo,"Venus enters your vibey twelfth house today, a wonderful aspect for cleansing your soul and mind. Venus is the planet of ease, so releasing old baggage shouldn’t be as painful a process as it can be at other times. Take some down time to pamper and nurture yourself, relaxing in solitude as you close the door on the madding crowd. Healing, surrender, closure—this can happen if you sit with yourself. Should you need the help of a therapist, grief counselor, or even someone in the metaphysical field, by all means reach out to them.

"
8251,13 july 2017,virgo,"One-on-one relationships or collaborations will benefit from an auspicious Moon-Neptune aspect. Neptune is the planet of dreams and letting things flow, so this is an excellent time to express your deepest thoughts and opinions to the people in your world.

"
8252,13 july 2016,virgo,"Ground control to Major Tom! If you feel like you’re living in a fourth dimension rather than on planet Earth, you can thank Mercury for that. The planet of thinking and communicating has just entered your intuitive twelfth house, turning you into a walking radio tower. Venus is already there, and between these two your personal psychic ability should soar. Pay attention to gut hunches, as they will be especially on target over the next five weeks.

"
8253,14 july 2017,virgo,"You can strike a nice balance between logic and intuition, so rely upon both for making decisions and going through your day. It’s important to tap into your hidden wisdom as the people around you seem to be too involved in their own personal dramas to be of much help!

"
8254,14 july 2016,virgo,"How  you present your message today is just as important as its content. Be careful not to push too hard when communicating with others, as assertive Mars may make you come on too strong. Your emotions may get the better of you, due to no-holds-barred Uranus acting up. Combine logic with your feelings before you speak.

"
8255,15 july 2017,virgo,"Make every effort to meet new people and socialize, because some of the people you connect with could become quite important to you over the next few months. This is true both personally and professionally. Once the Sun moves into Leo next week you may feel like withdrawing a bit, so get out there and mingle now.

"
8256,15 july 2016,virgo,"Any kind of family or residential matter that needs to be resolved should be tackled today, Virgo. A helpful meeting between the Moon and Saturn will help you get the ball rolling. While the issue may not be taken care of by the time the Sun sets, that’s not a problem. Positive energy in the first half of next week will assist you in wrapping things up.

"
8257,16 july 2017,virgo,"You may need to draw a fine line with your friends, as some of them may be getting too involved in your personal affairs. Whether it’s a platonic pal who seems to want more than that, or a BFF who’s butting their nose into your business, diplomatically let them know where you stand.

"
8258,16 july 2016,virgo,"Your intuition is a s sharp as a razor, Virgo, but don’t be afraid to use it to cut through BS and concerns that have been on your mind! It’s a valuable tool to be used with care. Today it may help you figure out what’s going on in the minds and hearts of the people closest to you, like friends and lovers. A harmonious trine between Mars and the Sun allows you to get closer to them by communicating your thoughts–and intuitive hits.

"
8259,17 july 2017,virgo,"It will be hard to determine just how committed someone is to a particular course of action, be they a lover, friend or business connection. Things can get way too emo if you push for an answer, so your best bet is to sit back and wait for a better day in the cosmos.

"
8260,17 july 2016,virgo,"Home is where the heart is, and the planets are actively trying to bring you serenity and comfort where you live. Serious Saturn is on the case, asking you to consider the people in your life who may be “disturbing the peace”, so to speak. A full moon on Tuesday in your house of children and lovers will illuminate any problems you may be having with them. If the inmates are running the asylum, no way is Mama or Papa going to be happy. Singles, your place should be an oasis. If others are taking away from that, it’s time to take action.

"
8261,18 july 2017,virgo,"With today’s auspicious Venus-Jupiter trine, you won’t be in the mood for anything that’s built on a shaky foundation, whether it’s a career move or a romance. With the two most beneficial planets in the solar system in your house of stability, you’re in a terrific spot to create strength and long term viability.

"
8262,18 july 2016,virgo,"How strong is your romantic relationship? That’s the question posed by Pluto today as it meets up with the emotional Moon in your house of love. Pluto’s role is to point out weaknesses in any given situation. Considering that tomorrow’s full moon is in this part of the sky, you should be thinking long and hard about your level of happiness. The full moon will give you the opportunity to improve matters, or move on.

"
8263,19 july 2017,virgo,"Sometimes one of the most important things we can do for ourselves is to take the time for inner work. Today is excellent for getting your thoughts and emotions out into the “open”, but in a secluded way! For instance, start a daily journal. Talk to a trusted confidante. Make an appointment with a therapist. Meditate. Do the work and reap the rewards.

"
8264,19 july 2016,virgo,"Today’s full moon in your house of romance may serve as a wakeup call. Just how much intimacy and bonding are you enjoying? If the answer is “not enough”, then you need to have a talk with your amour. A positive Mercury-Saturn angle however, does indicate that you have a good chance to work things out.

"
8265,20 july 2017,virgo,"Separating fiction from reality is going to be crucial over the next four weeks with so much planetary activity taking place in your house of the mind. Mars entered it today and the Sun arrives on Saturday. From people to circumstances, if it doesn’t feel authentic, it probably isn’t. Close out the past and move on.

"
8266,20 july 2016,virgo,"You’re craving more stability and emotional security, Virgo, and today’s aspects could bring you closer to that state of contentment. Inner work is what it’s all about, as silky smooth Venus is smoothing things over from the house of your subconscious mind. Take some time to consider what habits and thought patterns you can release to make your life operate on a more even keel.

"
8267,21 july 2017,virgo,"People may not be on the same page today, and as a result emotions could start to bubble over. Someone could even display an outburst (and that includes you), so it may be wise to avoid known divas and malcontents. Once the Sun enters Leo tomorrow you’ll get a better handle on what to do next with these folks.

"
8268,21 july 2016,virgo,"An exercise regimen or health practice may need some tweaking today in order for you to be operating at your personal best. What needs to be changed? Be brutally honest with yourself. When the Sun enters Leo tomorrow, you’ll have four weeks in which to reach out to doctors, dietitians, physical therapists and other healers for advice and treatment.

"
8269,22 july 2017,virgo,"You are entering into a major life changing phase, one in which you will be making important long term decisions about what (and whom) is staying in your life–and what’s not. That’s because the Sun has entered Leo, your twelfth house of closure and healing. Create your short list now, then get ready to implement it with tomorrow’s new moon.

"
8270,22 july 2016,virgo,"Jupiter has been blessing you with its presence in your first house since last August, pushing you to initiate projects in all parts of your life, from love to health to money. It will be leaving your sign in early September, and now that the Sun is in Leo, the time is right for some serious strategizing. Spend the next four weeks figuring out your game plan for your birthday year ahead.

"
8271,23 july 2017,virgo,"It takes a lot of energy for a caterpillar to morph into a butterfly, and a certain amount of seclusion as well. That’s the message behind today’s new moon in Leo. Pull away from the madding crowd as you take care of the important inner work that’s needed. Serenity may take time to develop, but it is so worth it.

"
8272,23 july 2016,virgo,"Plan a special night out with your honey, as this is one of the most romantic days of the month. The passionate Moon connects with amorous Neptune, so don’t go the pizza and movie route. Neptune says to go glam or go home. No honey in sight? Then get out there and show off the goods, my friend. You never know whom you may bump into.

"
8273,24 july 2017,virgo,"Trying to figure out a happy balance between work and your personal life could feel onerous today, but relief is in sight. Spunky Uranus could hit you with a “Eureka!” moment in which a potential solution becomes available, so pay attention.

"
8274,24 july 2016,virgo,"Sweet relief! A productive Moon-Sun trine helps you get to the bottom of issues that may have been ruffling your emotions as of late. The Sun is in the sector that governs the deepest recesses of your psyche, and it shines its light to help you release, cleanse and move on.

"
8275,25 july 2017,virgo,"Yassss!! Clever Mercury zips into Virgo today, helping you speak with eloquence and come up with cutting edge ideas. You’re in an excellent position to use both your intuition and logic, so rely on both over the next three weeks.

"
8276,25 july 2016,virgo,"With Uranus scheduled to go retrograde this Friday in your house of intimacy and deep emotions, it’s wise to get in touch with your feelings now, particularly when they come to love. Get to the bottom of issues that have troubled you in the past, or those that have kept you from experiencing only the truest kind of love. Whether you’re single or attached, content or miserable, this is the starting point for a happier future.

"
8277,26 july 2017,virgo,"Your best work will be done in private, as a Sun-Mars connection encourages you to pull away from the madding crowd. Whether you’re rewriting your resume, trying to get rid of bad habits or planning the next chapter of your life, some quiet time is in order. You’ll be able to get a heck of a lot done.

"
8278,26 july 2016,virgo,"If you believe in karma, then you’ll enjoy today’s planetary energy. You’ve been learning a lot of lessons about love and life. A sweet Moon-Pluto-North Node triangle helps pull together a lot of the pieces. You’re learning that you don’t have to suffer; you’ve paid your dues. Now get out there and grab the brass ring.

"
8279,27 july 2017,virgo,"Who are the “right” kind of people who should be in your life? This isn’t about being snobby; it’s about surrounding yourself with folks who allow you to be yourself and retain your dignity in the process. People should fill your soul, not deplete it.

"
8280,27 july 2016,virgo,"Baring your soul? You could suddenly feel the urge to divulge some deep thoughts and emotions to someone close. Or, you could be at the receiving end of someone else’s sharing session. Either way, it’s a positive, cathartic event. Try to get as much out in the open as possible before Uranus goes retrograde on Friday.

"
8281,28 july 2017,virgo,"Luck is on your side in financial matters, thanks to abundant Jupiter in your income sector. But you know the old saying, “The harder I work, the ‘luckier’ I get.” It ain’t gonna happen if you sit on your butt, so start shaking that money tree.

"
8282,28 july 2016,virgo,"The great benefic Jupiter will remain in Virgo for just a few more weeks, so now is the time to really think about new plans. With several planets in your behind-the-scenes sector, it’s smart to take some quiet time to strategize. But with Jupiter winking at the Moon in the most expansive area of your chart, you won’t be thinking small.

"
8283,29 july 2017,virgo,"You need to plan for the future just as much as you live for today, Virgo. The good life beckons but it has a price. Balance your present finances with your plans for tomorrow.

"
8284,29 july 2016,virgo,"Your sex life may go from a rolling boil to a sizzling simmer instead, courtesy of Uranus going retrograde in your house of eroticism. But lest you think that a prescription for Viagra is necessary, consider this. A toned down libido will give you the opportunity to think things through. Is your relationship based just on lust? Are you sharing your thoughts and emotions with each other? Singles will become more interested in meeting a soulmate than Mr. or Ms. Right Now.

"
8285,30 july 2017,virgo,"This is Venus’s last day in your house of ambition, so you’d be wise to wrap up any goal planning that you’ve been involved in. Fortunately Venus makes a stellar aspect with planet of genius Uranus, which can spark some last minute (and ground breaking) ideas for you to pursue. Conduct your research then move ahead.

"
8286,30 july 2016,virgo,"Your birthday season is approaching, and the first planet to get the party started is bright little Mercury. It zips into Virgo today, stoking your brain with a number of ideas that can prove to be winners. But make sure you act on them quickly. Mercury will be in your sign for a longer time than usual but it retrogrades a month from today. Reach out to people, draw up plans, sketch ideas, make travel plans, and talk love, as well as money.

"
8287,31 july 2017,virgo,"Life becomes a lot more social now that Venus is in your house of mingling and networking! Over the next three weeks you should make it your mission to spend as much time with others as you can, not only for the sheer joy of it, but also to make valuable new contacts. And if a particular friendship has reached its sell-by date, it may be time to move on.

"
8288,31 july 2016,virgo,"Romance could hit a bump in the road when it appears that your needs are not being considered by your lover. Singles might be looking at their friends today, questioning why they  seem to have all the good stuff in life and you don’t. It’s that kind of a day, but let it pass. The good news: highly romantic Neptune has your back from the commitment sector.

"
8289,1 august 2017,virgo,"Finding a balance between your social life and family responsibilities becomes easier today with a Moon-Venus aspect. Venus just entered your networking sector, so there should be no shortage of invitations coming your way. Just make time for yourself and loved ones and everyone will be happy.

"
8291,2 august 2017,virgo,"Long term emotional stability is the name of the game as mature Saturn pushes for peace of mind. And you’d be wise to pay attention, as next week’s eclipse will help you develop good habits that will help you destress and feel like you’re on top of things.

"
8292,2 august 2016,virgo,"“Earth to Virgo. Come in, Virgo.” Don’t be surprised if your feet aren’t planted firmly on the ground over the next few weeks. Mars has just entered your vibey twelfth house, the place of the higher mind. To say that you’re going to be intuitive is an understatement. Mars joins Saturn, which will help back up your psychic hits with logic. Beam back down when you’re ready.

"
8293,3 august 2017,virgo,"This is no time to take risks in either love or money, as erratic Uranus retrogrades over the next five months. Slow and steady is the way to go, ensuring that you have all the facts before you take the plunge. Keep the old fable about the tortoise and the hare in mind and you’ll do fine. Think “Team Tortoise”.

"
8294,3 august 2016,virgo,"Strategizing is key right now, Virgo. With the Sun and moon in the most confidential part of your chart, your mind will be busy with figuring out your next step. Innovative Uranus sparks some brilliant new ideas, yet stern Saturn keeps it real by reminding you that security is important. The bottom line: you develop logical plans that won’t put you at risk.

"
8295,4 august 2017,virgo,"Following routines and maintaining stability counts for a lot with next week’s eclipse arriving in your habit-driven sixth house—so why allow anyone or anything to be a disruptive influence? A Jupiter -Pluto square brings out the drama in someone. Make sure it’s not you.

"
8296,4 august 2016,virgo,"Get ready for showtime! Your official birthday season doesn’t begin for a few weeks, but the Moon and Venus are getting ready to glide into your sign within the next 24 hours. You’ll be gaining more attention in the days ahead–bask in it!

"
8297,5 august 2017,virgo,"Hmmm..considering an affair? Or maybe you just want to steal away with your amour for a juicy weekend tryst. With a passionate Sun-Neptune aspect, hiding behind closed doors is just what the cosmos ordered.

"
8298,5 august 2016,virgo,"Venus enters your sign today, Virgo, and she’s going to be a busy lady over the next few weeks. The first item on her agenda is handling the expectations others have of you. Seems like some people in your circle have been needy, placing too many demands on your time and attention. Or they’re sticking their nose where it doesn’t belong. It’s time to draw a line in the sand.

"
8299,6 august 2017,virgo,"It’s a battle between the head versus the heart as the passionate Moon can’t figure out which end is up. I’d put money on the head wining this round as a lunar eclipse on Monday falls in the most practical part of your chart.

"
8300,6 august 2016,virgo,"An ongoing theme over the past year has been your needs versus those of the people around you. Chances are you’re getting tired of being the family peacemaker or go-to errand girl/boy. The calm one in a friendship or romance who’s always giving. The sturdy workhorse at the office. Well, this weekend’s planetary aspects may bring everything to a state of critical mass. Don’t explode–set boundaries instead.

"
8301,7 august 2017,virgo,"Get out of Virgo’s way! A lunar eclipse in their house of organization and efficiency is going to turn them into a whirling dervish of activity. Out with slow routines, buh-bye bad habits, good bye slackers. It’s time to make your life run better than a well-oiled machine, and with motivator Mars raring to clean house (literally and figuratively) you can haul ass.

"
8302,7 august 2016,virgo,"Your ability to dig deep and get right to the heart of a matter is strong, Virgo, thanks to intelligent Mercury in your first house. But others may not be amenable to what you have to say. Don’t expect people in your circle to agree with you and jump on board with whatever it is that you’re proposing. Neptune is clouding their vision. Wait until Wednesday, when your words will ring with clarity.

"
8303,8 august 2017,virgo,"A sudden desire to get fit and toned could hit out of the blue, and if you want to look that way to ramp up your sex appeal–that’s what the cosmos has in mind! Hell, what’s the point of all that discipline and grunt work if you’re not going to make others  sweat with lust? Spunky Uranus in your libido zone tells you to go for it.

"
8304,8 august 2016,virgo,"Mercury is retrograde in your first house, which means that although your brain may be buzzing with ideas and opinions, you could still fall prey to others’ agendas. Maverick Uranus acts up today, suggesting that a partner may be playing on your emotions. This could be in the business realm as well as romance, so stay on your toes. The fog begins to clear tomorrow.

"
8305,9 august 2017,virgo,"Too much work and not enough play will make for one cranky Virgo. Bad boy Pluto in your fun and relaxation sector demands some down time, so book it! However, if burnout is the issue, a nice day at the spa with a massage and glass of Prosecco is advised over a wild night out on the town.

"
8306,9 august 2016,virgo,"With planet of communication, Mercury, in your first house of goals and self-image, your words carry weight. But the problem lately is that people around you may not be listening, or they choose to stick to their own viewpoint. That’s about to change. As the Moon glides into decisive Scorpio today, expect to have more of a willing audience.

"
8307,10 august 2017,virgo,"A friend could play matchmaker today, and online looks pretty good too! Romantic Venus is in a good spot to bring more amour into your life. Coupled up Virgos can hold productive conversations about long term goals and dreams, especially where finances are concerned.

8308,10 august 2016,virgo,"If there was ever a time to dazzle someone, today’s the day! A fabulous aspect between outgoing Mercury in your house of self-image and powerful Pluto makes your voice the one to be heard.

"
8309,11 august 2017,virgo,"The recent eclipse is ratcheting up your efficiency level, and no doubt you want to see results for your efforts.

A Jupiter-Uranus angle suggests that it may be time to review household expenses, or to start saving for a down payment for a home. Refinancing an existing mortgage is on the table, as is ensuring that your family will be taken care of in the future through wise investments. As for dramas? They need to go.

"
8311,12 august 2017,virgo,"“Nobody gets me!” That may be your battle cry over the next three weeks as Mercury retrogrades in your sign. This feeling may be strongest in your romance, as Mercury opposes amorous Neptune today.

"
8312,12 august 2016,virgo,"Your emotional and financial security will be on your mind, as the planets shine their light on your home, love and financial houses. Over the past five months you may have been putting out fires within the family, trying to improve your residential situation or working hard to balance your budget. All of this focus on safety and comfort, though, may have you questioning when you’ll get to experience more fun. Try next week, on the 17th, a gorgeous day to cut loose.

"
8314,13 august 2016,virgo,"With Saturn finally moving direct in your domestic sector, family and residential matters can start to move forward. Today’s a good time to start, as a positive Moon-Sun-Uranus angle works on your behalf. You may have to take control of a situation that has been going on for awhile, but it’s wise to do so without making a big announcement about it. Work behind the scenes, especially if money is involved.

"
8315,14 august 2017,virgo,"Independent streak? If you feel like busting loose—from the day job, your current circumstances, even a romance—blame it on the Moon-Venus connection! Over the next few days feeling restricted is a real possibility, but the good news is that you’re not going to care. Why bother, when you can march to the beat of your own drum?

"
8316,14 august 2016,virgo,"Not on the same page? Venus and Neptune oppose each other in the heavens, indicating that you and a partner may not be in agreement. You have to make sure that the other person–a lover or business partner–isn’t telling you what you want to hear, however. The good news is that a strong Capricorn Moon will help out, adding a dash of smarts and strength to what could be an otherwise confusing situation.

"
8317,15 august 2017,virgo,"If you like getting pulled into someone else’s soap opera life, then you’ll enjoy today’s Pluto-Venus opposition.

8322,17 august 2016,virgo,"Yum. A sweet meeting in the heavens between Venus and Pluto works wonders, as romantic feelings can be expressed with ease. Thinking about asking someone out or popping the question? Carpe diem, baby. Couples can embark on a new and much more satisfying chapter.

"
8323,18 august 2017,virgo,"That’s what friends are for! A buddy could help you out in some way, so don’t be hesitant about asking for their assistance.

"
8325,19 august 2017,virgo,"Sudden pangs of envy may crop up as erratic Uranus is in a touchy mood today. Whether the envy comes from you or is directed toward you, you’ll need to develop a better perspective.

"
8326,19 august 2016,virgo,"This could be quite a delicious day for romance with the amorous Moon gliding next to Neptune. So why the reluctance on your part? The North Node is acting up, that’s why.

Jupiter, Mercury and Venus are already in Virgo, and with the Sun joining them today, you have four very friendly and helpful planets by your side.

You want to know where things are going in love and you desire a happy life at home. But this hot-blooded planet could make you too anxious for things to happen, and you may push up against someone close to you who’s not going to appreciate it. Nor will be they be willing to give you straight answers. Chill–your optimism returns tomorrow.

Perhaps you want to spend more quality time with loved ones (or just by yourself!), maybe you’re sick of eating takeout and want to learn how to master Italian cuisine. A new sport may be calling your name, as well as far off exotic locales that would make a perfect vacation destination.

Otherwise you might bite off more than you can chew!

"
8362,26 september 2016,virgo,"Others are going to be green with envy, Virgo, because you’re going to be rolling in the green. A terrific Sun-Jupiter conjunction today marks the beginning of a very prosperous period ahead. This will be in the form of income you earn rather than win or inherit, but you’re up for the task. A new moon later in the week could also help you land a new job, a raise, or kick your company’s revenues into high gear.

"
8363,27 september 2016,virgo,"Hey there, Van Gogh! Your creativity should shoot through the roof now that Mars is in your house of creativity. Even if you’re not in an artistic field, your skills can take enormous leaps ahead in the next 7 weeks. Not only that, more romance should be in the air as this is also the house of love, fun, meeting new people and spending more time with a current amour. Pluto has just gone direct here after a 5 month hiatus. You should now feel more capable, persuasive and dynamic than ever before.

"
8364,28 september 2016,virgo,"You and a partner may be at opposite ends of the spectrum today, courtesy of a Moon-Neptune opposition. Whether your partnership is a romantic or business one, you need to pay close attention to the verbal and non-verbal cues you’re receiving. While you seem to be in a positive, even creative, state of mind, your partner may not be sharing your enthusiasm. Make sure you’re hearing their true opinion.

"
8365,29 september 2016,virgo,"Catharsis!  You might experience a breakthrough today with an emotional issue and it could happen nice and quick. Spontaneous Uranus in your eighth house of deep thoughts and intimacy forms a helpful angle with the Moon, so use this energy to get in touch with worries, upset feelings and dramas from the past so that they can be dealt with, once and for all.

"
8366,30 september 2016,virgo,"If you have been concerned about where you stand in a situation, especially when it pertains to love or your financial security, today brings some relief. The next few days are excellent for talking things over with others as Venus and Neptune are forming a fabulous trine over the weekend. If you’re looking for inspiration, say for starting a business or where to find new love, it will be there in abundance

"
8367,1 october 2016,virgo,"Oh, yeah, here it comes—dinero, moolah, beaucoup bucks, dough (hello, 1960s time travelers), cash, the almighty dollar. Whatever you choose to call it, it’s calling your name thanks to a hot new moon today in your income sector. This isn’t about winning a lottery ticket but going out there and earning it. A Venus-Neptune trine occurring at the same time suggests that you don’t go it alone, but instead partner up with a savvy expert or “co-conspirator” who can help you both profit.

"
8368,2 october 2016,virgo,"With so much planetary emphasis on your income, especially after yesterday’s new moon, no one would blame you for being fixated on the almighty dollar. As the week progresses your sense of security should increase, as Saturn is determined to show you not only the money, but a satisfied sense of financial strength. The key is to make sure that a lover and kids know the value of a buck, and that they need to be budget conscious as well as you do.

"
8369,3 october 2016,virgo,"A harmless flirtation could turn into something much more in the days ahead! And if you’re already involved with someone, the early part of this week is a good time to discuss where things are headed. The need for security is prominent in your chart, so don’t feel shy about demanding some answers.

"
8370,4 october 2016,virgo,"It’s important to remain realistic about money matters this week, as Jupiter may make you overly optimistic about your financial prospects. Disciplined Saturn demands taking a conservative approach today, especially when it comes to home-related expenses and your retirement plan. Fortunately Saturn helps to develop good habits, such as setting aside money every week in savings. Keep it real, as well as consistent.

"
8371,5 october 2016,virgo,"Got that creative mojo rising? Pluto in your artistic fifth house is pulling out all the stops when it comes to allowing you to think and express yourself in a more innovative manner. Today it forms a superb angle with charismatic Venus in the communication sector. If you have a message to get out there–to a lover, a child, the news media, your boss–by all means let your ideas be heard.

"
8372,6 october 2016,virgo,"Control your impulses today, as aggressive Mars is pitted against optimistic Jupiter. You may be tempted to take a risk—in love, with money, in a creative endeavor or sports—that could lead to trouble. Especially in matters involving romance or your kids, you need to keep a cool head as arguments could erupt.

"
8373,7 october 2016,virgo,"The next two weeks could be rather moody as planets in your security-conscious second house face off against those in your emotional eighth. While the Sun and Jupiter have been operating as a tag team in recent weeks, determined to boost your income as well as your confidence, they’ve been up against Pluto and Mars. A romance may be wobbly, causing you to be on edge, or an issue with a child might be troubling you. Old fears and worries could be bubbling to the surface. Good news, however: today intelligent Mercury joins the Sun and Jupiter, helping you think rationally and calmly about what’s ahead. In addition, now is the perfect time to shop your resume or build your business.

"
8374,9 october 2016,virgo,"Something could come out of left field– a remark someone makes or a thought you have–which will make you question just where you stand in matters of the heart. Single or attached, it’s time to consider what you want or need in romance. The two most dynamic planets in the solar system, Mars and Pluto, are determined to make you view yourself differently, and therefore love.

"
8375,10 october 2016,virgo,"This week could bring the breakthrough that you’ve been waiting for when it comes to earning a whole lot mo’ money. The cash won’t fall into your lap–you’r going to have to make things happen. With the Moon in your organized sixth house today, spend some time drawing up a game plan, schedule, routine, pitch or whatever it takes to help you solidify your ideas.

"
8376,11 october 2016,virgo,"Yowza! Virgos are looking like the next Bill Gates with a stellar meeting of Jupiter and Mercury in your income sector. If you have an idea for a business, book, patent, or screenplay, get cracking. Likewise if you’re pitching ideas, making sales calls, looking for a new job or working on an ad or social media campaign. With Mars in your house of talent, your mojo will definitely be rising.

"
8377,12 october 2016,virgo,"You may need to be the voice of reason in a romantic or business situation in the days ahead, especially when it comes to finances and budgeting. Don’t give in to guilt trips or pressure as others may try to flex their muscles. A full moon next Sunday in your house of fiscal strength will put you on the right path for building wealth.

"
8378,13 october 2016,virgo,"Yes, you want fun. Yes, you want love and sex and a happy relationship. And maybe you want a ring, a baby, a commitment, a vacation….the list goes on. But strong arming someone else into giving you what you want simply isn’t going to work, not this week anyway! Face it, some of life’s most important milestones happen at their own sweet time.

"
8379,14 october 2016,virgo,"The planets warn that you need to be in charge of your financial future and not rely too much on others for your security. Today a helpful Mercury-Saturn aspect is perfect for figuring out your next step when it comes to building wealth. Intelligent Mercury is in your income sector, inspiring you to come up with money-making ideas (that aren’t half baked!).

"
8380,15 october 2016,virgo,"Financial matters may be all over the map with four planets in a contentious mood. Make sure you’ve got a handle on your savings, checking and investment accounts as erratic Uranus may throw you a curveball. An unexpected expense could crop up. Likewise, a person may be in a demanding mood—your ex, a business partner, a lover or a creditor. Knowing your financial status inside and out will be half the battle.

"
8381,16 october 2016,virgo,"Waiting to hear news about a money matter? You may get word soon as a full moon in your financial sector wraps up things: a court case, mortgage application, commission, bonus, inheritance or paying down a credit card. That being said, there could be an unexpected development, such as an expense you weren’t anticipating, or a better one—a job offer that comes your way on short notice. It could also be a sizzling day for romance as your libido gets a boost from the lunation! Sparks could fly with your amour—or a new hottie.

"
8382,17 october 2016,virgo,"In the mood for love and romance? I sure hope so, because the cosmos has some goodies in store for you this week. Starting with today, in fact! A sweet trine between the passionate Moon and charismatic Pluto makes you the hottest thing on two legs. Not only that, it’s Pluto’s job to point out where you have been selling yourself short in the love department in years past. It’s time for the real deal.

"
8383,18 october 2016,virgo,"Your emotions and sense of contentment could get a happy boost over the next few weeks as cathartic Venus has just entered the sector of  sensitivity and security. This is helpful as the recent full moon in Aries may have brought old grudges and traumas to the surface, especially in matters of the heart. Now’s a good time to talk…and to heal. With the Sun entering your communication sector this Saturday, opening up is the key to feeling more serene.

"
8384,19 october 2016,virgo,"Confidence is sexy, and your self-assured air ought to turn a few heads this week! A rare conjunction occurs today between Mars and Pluto, the planets that govern charisma and strength. They aren’t wimpy little wallflowers, and neither will you be under their influence. Since they meet up in your house of romance, it’s time to take charge of your love life whether you’re attached or single. Mind you, with Mars present you could be a tad…aggressive, but hey, sometimes that’s needed. There is some seriously sexy mojo going on here, so take it and run with it!

"
8385,20 october 2016,virgo,"Keep the plastic in your wallet as impulse buying could lead you down the retail therapy path today. The recent full moon was all about building a strong financial base: don’t screw things up by spending money that you may not have. Also, keep your eyes and ears open for last minute changes in a financial agreement, such as a loan or joint venture. Make sure that you understand all the terms and know what you’re getting into.

"
8386,21 october 2016,virgo,"Are your expectations about love realistic? The same holds true for your kids—are you clear on how to raise them? With the Moon in a rather emotional spot today you may be questioning these things, especially when it comes to the long term outlook. With the recent full moon falling in your finance sector you may be concerned about having enough money as a couple or as a family. The new moon on the 30th is perfect for brainstorming money-saving and making ideas.

"
8387,22 october 2016,virgo,"A more exciting, social time kicks off today as the fiery Sun enters your house of chatting, mingling and expressing yourself. “Self-expression” can take many forms: penning a novel, writing a blog post, taking fantastic photos, drawing, lecturing, or merely having coffee with the neighbors. In the weeks ahead you may decide to take a class, travel to a nearby city and visit the museums and other attractions, or head to a quiet bed and breakfast in the countryside. With a new moon coming in this part of the sky on the 30th, start researching your options now.

"
8388,23 october 2016,virgo,"Time to hold a budget meeting! Get a grip on your finances, especially if you share them with a spouse or business partner. There could be way too much optimism and confusion going on, and a Jupiter-Neptune aspect today will help you cut through some of it. The early part of this week is perfect for discussing “where are we going with this relationship” topics as well. Be careful, though: Tuesday things could get tense.

"
8389,24 october 2016,virgo,"Talk much? Now that chatty Mercury is in your house of communication, it should be far easier to get your point across. And you shouldn’t have to use strong arm tactics either. One of your best days all year for self-expression is this Thursday. Schedule job interviews or important client presentations, negotiate deals, apply to school and polish up your art portfolio.

"
8390,25 october 2016,virgo,"Are you on the same page as others in your immediate circle? Maybe so, but today’s confusing Neptune-Venus square will make you wonder. With Venus on your house of security and contentment you definitely want to know where you stand in all of your relationships and circumstances. But Neptune swirls its mist, so beware of people telling you what they think you want to hear.

"
8391,26 october 2016,virgo,"A strong sense of security comes from many sources: a steady job, money in the bank, being in a committed relationship and experiencing peace at home, among other things. A happy Venus-Jupiter aspect today helps you make headway when it comes to feeling more content. With a positive Sun-Mercury angle tomorrow in your communication sector, the best way to start is by opening the lines of communication.

"
8392,27 october 2016,virgo,"Speak your truth! This is one of the best days all year to say what’s on your mind. Reach out to people you need to speak with, whether it’s a lover, family member or a potential new boss. The mighty Sun and candid Mercury meet up in your communication sector, making this a superb time to express yourself eloquently. This also refers to showcasing your ideas, art portfolio, a marketing plan, sales pitch, negotiating a contract and teaching.

"
8393,28 october 2016,virgo,"Nothing worthwhile was ever achieved without passion, and these wise words apply to you today, Virgo. A meeting of the ardent Moon and abundant Jupiter could be just the push you need to get moving on a project that is close to your heart. The good thing is that these two are in your house of routine and planning, so you can start to pursue your ambition with a smart game plan at hand.

"
8394,29 october 2016,virgo,"Patience is a virtue, Virgo, and today the cosmos may be testing yours, especially when it comes to romance or a family matter. You may be anxious to settle something: a dispute with a parent, selling your house, starting a family, or finding a new love to name a few examples. Erratic Uranus stirs the pot and aggressive Mars wants answers now. But mature Saturn is nearby, telling you to take the time to make wise decisions, not rash ones based on pure emotion.

"
8395,30 october 2016,virgo,"With both the Sun and Mercury in your house of networking and communicating, you could be chatting up a storm these days. You might want to consider talking with others about partnering up on a venture while you’re at it. Today’s new moon falls in your talkative third house, and it happens to be well aspected by inspirational Neptune in the alliance sector. Create a neighborhood watch association, join the PTO, get an exercise buddy, join a singles group and consider taking on a business partner. New connections could prove to be quite stimulating!

"
8396,31 october 2016,virgo,"It’s time to toss out old, worn out ideas and replace them with some more empowering ones. The recent new moon in your house of thinking and communicating is urging you to sharpen your mental acuity and presentation skills. The best way to do this is to find some forward thinking people, movers and shakers, and pick their brains. Find a mentor, hook up with a business partner, read a book about personal development or hire a coach. Feed your head.

"
8397,1 november 2016,virgo,"Do you need to talk with a partner? Then do so today, as a fabulous Sun-Neptune trine not only opens up the lines of communication but clears up misunderstandings. This holds true for business alliances as well as romantic ones, by the way. From current planetary aspects it appears that the other party hasn’t always been as straightforward as you would have liked. Push for clarity now.

"
8398,2 november 2016,virgo,"Your creativity will soar in the days ahead, courtesy of a number of inspirational planetary aspects. The Sun in Scorpio is encouraging you to make like a giant sponge and absorb all the information you can soak up, good stuff that will increase your skill level. Whether you’re a parent, student, CEO, artist or truck driver, study how other people live successfully and model their techniques.

"
8399,3 november 2016,virgo,"Someone needs to take charge of a situation, Virgo, and that person is you. This is especially true in matters of the heart and in dealing with kids. Two terrific aspects, one today and the next one on Monday, will help put you in charge without needing to resort to tyrannical tendencies. And while you’re at it, start carving out more free time for yourself, OK? The cosmos urges more “play time” for you, whatever that means: indulging in hobbies, sports, art and culture or the company of friends.

"
8400,4 november 2016,virgo,"A series of positive planetary aspects is encouraging you to get things out into the open, Virgo. Holding in emotions and thoughts, especially if they’re of the negative variety, won’t help you or your relationships with the people around you. Don’t be surprised if the gates open wide once you start talking as spontaneous Uranus is on the scene. Not only will you feel better, your enjoyment of life will increase dramatically.

"
8401,5 november 2016,virgo,"An emotional breakthrough could be reached today as spontaneous Uranus in your house of deep emotions is in a helpful mood. Old, buried feelings of worthlessness, resentment and jealousy (some which may date way  back) can be brought to the surface and then promptly taken to the trash bin. Fortunately the planet of ease and comfort, Venus, is involved, so this could be a fairly painless process.

"
8402,6 november 2016,virgo,"The cosmos is stirring up big changes for you in love this week as Pluto, planet of transformation, is quite active. You want security, soulful conversations and steamy sex (thanks to a sizzling Venus-Uranus trine), but Pluto says that if you don’t ask, you don’t get. So be vocal, Virgo–let your lover know what you need. Singles–create a short list of the qualities you want in a mate, then start hunting–and stick to it.

"
8403,7 november 2016,virgo,"Don’t let your emotions get the better of you at the office, as events could push your buttons. The same holds true for stay-at-home parents who just want to get through their day, thank you very much, without interference from unhelpful customer service people, lines at the food store and monkey wrenches thrown into their plans. This too shall pass. Within the next 48 hours, so grin and bear it.

"
8404,8 november 2016,virgo,"Get your financial papers organized at work and at home, as you will soon be entering into a busy period when you can make a lot of progress with budgets and building a stronger monetary base. Consider what kind of new clients you want to pursue, what projects will bring in more revenues and what expenses you can safely cut at home. Luxury-loving Venus will be entering your house of fun on Friday, but you’ll need to live la vida local on a budget.

"
8405,9 november 2016,virgo,"Have you ever poured gasoline on a fire? Well, just in case you haven’t, a heck of a lot of energy is released. And that’s what going to happen to you, Virgo, as aggressive Mars just entered your house of organization and efficiency. You may be thinking that it’s redundant for an already productive Virgo to need more help in this department, but so it is! Over the next five weeks you’ll be on fire (no pun intended). Just watch the tendency to steamroll over co-workers, employees or service providers who aren’t anywhere near as efficient as you are. BTW: this is one of your best times in two years to start a diet and exercise program.

"
8406,10 november 2016,virgo,"You’re about to become a heck of a lot busier thanks to Mars entering your productivity zone. But why do everything by yourself and shoulder all of the responsibility? A lunar aspect recommends that you hold other people in your orbit responsible for their share of duties at home and at work. With Venus entering your house of fun and relaxation on Friday, you deserve some down time in the midst of all the grunt work.

"
8407,11 november 2016,virgo,"Keep your expenses under control, especially when it comes to purchasing luxury items or non-necessities. Luxe Venus enters your house of living the sweet life—entertainment, chic clothes, spa treatments—but over the next few days be practical with your purchases. Don’t worry, Virgo—you’ll be able to splurge a little next week.

"
8408,12 november 2016,virgo,"Taking careful risks is the message behind recent planetary activity in your chart, Virgo. On the one hand you’re being encouraged to bust out of a rut and live more creatively, while other planets are trying to keep your feet on the ground. The good news? You can pull this off. With rational Saturn in your house of security you won’t be coming up with any crazy ass schemes.

"
8409,13 november 2016,virgo,"With tomorrow’s full moon falling in your house of taking risks, you could be more than ready to start traveling down a new path. Optimistic Jupiter will help you come up with the right way to go about it. But will the people closest to you be on board? Planetary influences indicate that they may try to talk you out of your plans. Ultimately the decision is yours to make.

"
8410,14 november 2016,virgo,"Honey, you’ve got places to go and people to meet! An amazing full moon on your house of spontaneity, travel and broadening your horizons takes place today. Mercury and Mars are well aspected to bring about changes in your career, so if you’ve been thinking about going back to school to get a degree or a specialized license, now is a good time. The same holds true for careers in the government, news media, publishing and travel industries. You could be feeling so foot-loose that you may want some independence in romance, so keep that in mind!

"
8411,15 november 2016,virgo,"Your ever-practical sign is in true Virgo form today, with Mars and Mercury in ultra-productive mode. You’re ready to blast through projects both at home and at the office knowing that you’ll feel a lot more serene when you do. You also understand, with the Moon in your “big picture thinking” ninth house, that the faster you get through the grunt work the faster you’ll be able to pursue bigger goals—and some much deserved down time. But do the people around you get this?

"
8412,16 november 2016,virgo,"Take charge! You may suddenly become a lot more forceful when it comes to financial matters, not to mention a close emotional relationship with someone. If you have something on your mind by all means say it. This isn’t about being nasty, but letting people know that you have certain expectations. Security is very important to you right now—don’t accept half-baked promises or vague responses.

"
8413,17 november 2016,virgo,"Sometimes we have the luxury to just focus on our own passion projects; other times we need to set aside more time for our family and home life. This can mean setting big dreams aside for awhile as we attend to more pressing needs. Right now the cosmos is creating that kind of situation for you, but it won’t last long. Tend to the needs of your loved ones right now. When Neptune goes direct on Saturday you’ll be able to squeeze in more time for you.

"
8414,18 november 2016,virgo,"Should I stay or should I go? A tense Neptune-Mercury aspect may find you questioning a romantic or business partnership, as you’re not sure whether it’s worth it any longer. The recent full moon has been encouraging you to take chances and has probably fired up an independent streak. Consider your options, but don’t make any rash decisions under this aspect. Your sense of security is quite important to you. Wait until next week to make your move.

"
8415,19 november 2016,virgo,"Finally! The fog clears when it comes to romance as confusing Neptune goes direct. You can now make smart and firm decisions about not only love but business alliances and contracts that may be on offer. If you’ve been happily involved in love, then this forward movement will only add to your romance, bringing back more excitement and mystery.

"
8416,20 november 2016,virgo,"You might experience an “aha!” moment today, especially when it comes to understanding your emotions and thoughts…which of course lead to your actions. This is a positive event as the Moon in your intuitive sector forms a terrific aspect with spontaneous Uranus. Tomorrow the Sun enters Sagittarius, which will help you release negativity even faster. This is your house of comfort and security, so expect greater serenity in the weeks ahead.

"
8417,21 november 2016,virgo,"Everyone wants to have a sense of security in life, and you should be feeling that way more than the other signs of the zodiac. The Sun just entered the part of your chart that deals with sanctuary and guarantees, so don’t be surprised if you expect answers from other people–about a job offer, engagement ring, raise, family matter or long term business deal. Just be aware that Pluto is stirring the pot, telling you to take some chances. A calculated risk may be the ticket.

"
8418,22 november 2016,virgo,"If you have home and family matters that need to be straightened out, this is the week to do so, Virgo. A helpful Mercury-Jupiter aspect will enable you to make progress. There could be issues with a child or lover that especially need to be addressed, as Pluto could be ratcheting up their attitude a bit too high. Thursday and Friday bring some tense aspects, and of course that’s the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. Tomorrow is a good day for holding talks, which may include laying down some new rules.

"
8419,23 november 2016,virgo,"Major plans could be on your mind today when it comes to housing or family matters, Virgo. Planetary influences indicate that you need to hold talks with loved ones and formulate long term plans, and considering that the holiday weekend is almost here, this is a smart time to get started. Maybe you’re considering moving, or allowing a parent to live with you. Perhaps an elderly relative needs help in putting together their will, or you need to work out visitation arrangements with an ex. Start the discussions and then start making changes at the time of the new moon on the 29th.

"
8420,24 november 2016,virgo,"You’re in an interesting spot, Virgo. Optimistic Jupiter is in your house of security for the next 10 months, urging you to push past mental boundaries that have held you back. But you may be resisting this sensation today, clinging to the old ways. Family connections may be adding to this sense, as if you have to play it safe for their sake. Don’t worry, with sober Saturn in your house of family you won’t do anything too off the wall.

"
8421,25 november 2016,virgo,"“Passion” is a word that brings to mind a number of things: steamy sexual trysts, devotion to a worthy cause, or being focused on a skill or talent that you enjoy. And today the cosmos is igniting your passion, whatever that means to you. But the question is this: does your passion come with a price? Are you willing to give up other things (like security for example) in order to pursue your devotion? Consider the pros and cons.

"
8422,26 november 2016,virgo,"Sweet relief! Inspirational Uranus is in a cathartic mood today, blessing you with answers to emotional questions that may have plagued you for some time. Sometimes just realizing that you don’t have to suffer is all you need to break ties to the past that no longer serve you. Onward and upward!

"
8423,27 november 2016,virgo,"The list-loving, methodical left side of your brain is telling you to get organized thanks to the influence of Mars. Yet the Moon is stimulating the more creative right side of the brain to just chill and let things flow. Which one will win? I’d put my money on the Moon. Mars will be in this part of the sky for weeks to come; the Moon won’t. You’ll have plenty of time to blast through your chores in the weeks ahead.

"
8424,28 november 2016,virgo,"Matters of the heart could be a bit funky this week due to a Venus-Uranus square. Make sure that you’re not getting blinded by lust or good sex. Likewise, if you’re on the market for a new amour, there needs to be some substance behind someone’s charismatic exterior. With a lot of planetary activity going on in your domestic sector, you don’t want to be playing house with someone who’s not a serious contender.

"
8425,29 november 2016,virgo,"No one can push our buttons like family, and if anyone in your family unit has been acting up it’s time to put an end to it. A positive new moon today in your domestic sector will give you the opportunity to talk things over and to start anew. Kids (and maybe your lover too) need to understand that money doesn’t grow on trees, and that everyone is responsible for getting chores done. If you’re looking for ways to bank more cash for a down payment on a house, or to redecorate, the aspects are excellent for lining up new income streams.

"
8426,30 november 2016,virgo,"Family members may need a ration of whoop ass under today’s planetary influences. You can’t do it all, and why should you? If others are taking advantage of your time, generosity and patience, let them know that you have your limits. The same holds true for slacker co-workers. There’s no need to yell or scream—a quiet, stern look can work wonders.

"
8427,1 december 2016,virgo,"Your attention to detail and desire to be efficient can pay off handsomely, Virgo! Now that Mars is tearing a path through your house of productivity and organization you’re ready to make progress. And with profitable Jupiter in such a terrific angle, the grunt work that you plow through will actually lead to earning more. Time is money, and the more streamlined your home and office are, the more cash you’ll have in your pocket.

"
8428,2 december 2016,virgo,"Oh, yeah! Candid Mercury joins love planet Venus in your house of romance and fun today, quite a juicy aspect. Some of the holiday shopping and house cleaning can wait as you put yourself out there on the love market. The next few weeks are also perfect for parties, attending concerts, hitting the art galleries and shopping—for you.  Mani/pedis, massages, brunches with the girls—it’s time to play Santa for yourself. Have fun.

"
8429,3 december 2016,virgo,"With energetic Mars in your house of fitness and health, your motivation to look and feel better can skyrocket. Today’s planetary energy encourages you to jump start your new regimen at home by clearing out the kitchen cabinets of junk foods and sugary sodas. With disciplined Saturn in your domestic sector, one of the best ways to ensure that you stick to your plan is to work out at home rather than at a gym. This includes heading out the front door for a jog; you don’t need an expensive treadmill in the basement.

"
8430,4 december 2016,virgo,"Slow down and smell the roses. Or the coffee, pancakes and bacon! With high energy Mars now in your house of efficiency, chances are you’ve been moving fast–way too fast. While it’s nice to blast through your to-do list, you need some down time, and today the Moon demands it. Brunch, anyone?

"
8431,5 december 2016,virgo,"Motivation may strike you to take an in depth look at your finances, searching for ways you’re wasting money or not getting enough bang for your buck. Search for better rates on your credit cards, try to lower your mortgage payments, and get rid of expenses for things that you’re really not using–the gym membership, apps or monthly membership fees for a service. It’s time to feng shui your finances, and a penny saved is a penny earned.

"
8432,6 december 2016,virgo,"With dynamic Mars in your house of getting things done, you’re at risk of burning yourself out from overwork. Fortunately take-it-easy Venus enters this sector tomorrow, helping you make progress with less stress. A sparkling aspect with Uranus today indicates that someone may step forward and volunteer to work with you on some kind of a joint venture. The chances of it succeeding are high, so consider all offers seriously.

"
8433,7 december 2016,virgo,"Whistle while you work! Take-it-easy Venus glides into your house of efficiency today, joining megawatt Mars. If you’ve been blasting through your chores and work flow at 120 miles per hour, now things can slow down a bit. Don’t worry, you’ll still get things done. The stress level will drop and people around you may actually become more cooperative.

"
8434,8 december 2016,virgo,"Keep a close eye on household and business expenses as erratic Uranus could throw you a curveball if you’re not careful. This is actually a beneficial situation, even though at first glance it may not seem that way. The attention paid now to your finances can result in big benefits down the road as abundant Jupiter has your back.

"
8435,9 december 2016,virgo,"You’re an organized soul by nature, which makes today’s super productive Sun-Jupiter meeting perfect for pulling things together. Lucky Jupiter is in your income sector, and next week’s full moon falls in your career house. The cosmos’s message? Get your act together now in order to take advantage of the upcoming opportunities to earn more and take on greater responsibility.

"
8436,10 december 2016,virgo,"Domestic matters dragging you down? If that’s the case, put an end to them today. Serious Saturn has your back along with the authoritative Sun. Jackass roommates, nosy relatives, unresponsive landlords, exes who can’t follow a custody agreement, repair men or contractors who can’t show up on time—draw a line in the sand. If they cross it, they’re crossing you. And with next week’s full moon in the most authoritative part of your chart, they’ll be sorry that they did.

"
8437,11 december 2016,virgo,"The full moon next Tuesday occurs in your career sector, and it’s a game changer. You may decide to leave your current field and move to a completely new one, or leave a company that you’ve been with for a long time. Today the Moon sparks up an important conversation with Pluto, asking if you’re playing things a little too safe when it comes to your occupation. With Pluto in your house of skills, consider if you need to develop a new set in order to move on to a higher, more satisfying level.

"
8438,12 december 2016,virgo,"Break out the incense and crystals! A sudden desire to cleanse your psyche of things that have been bothering you may arise. By all means run with it, as the Sun is in your house of comfort and family ties. Enlightenment can take years, but sometimes it occurs rapidly. Now is a time when positive change can occur with lightning speed.

"
8439,13 december 2016,virgo,"Ready for more responsibility and the cash that should come with it? If so, today’s full moon in Gemini should help you nail down a new position. If you’ve been hunting for a job for some time, good news may be coming your way. Entrepreneurial types could be putting the finishing touches on their enterprise, although with Mercury retrograding in your creative sector next week, you may want to revisit the more innovative parts of your company’s line. Creatives would also be wise to put the finishing touches on their portfolios, but if you’re not completely ready to show it off, use the next few weeks to review everything.

"
8440,14 december 2016,virgo,"You’re becoming more determined to go after things that mean a lot to you, but do others support you? Actually, you may not even care with today’s Jupiter-Uranus opposition. If someone decides to get in your face about the path you plan to take, there’s no point in defending yourself. That being said, with the Sun about to enter your partnership zone, you may need to make a few concessions. Just a few.

"
8441,15 december 2016,virgo,"Keep a close eye on your wallet and your emotions today as some tense cosmic angles indicate that money matters may erupt. It could be an unexpected expense or a disagreement about a lover’s spending. Maybe the green-eyed monster has taken over as you lust for expensive swag that you see on a blog or on a friend’s Instagram page. Think before you splurge.

"
8442,17 december 2016,virgo,"Setting boundaries with others may not always be easy, but from the looks of your chart it appears to be necessary. Stern Saturn demands that you have more peace of mind, and if that requires laying down the law, so be it. You may end up being pleasantly surprised at how relaxed you feel right away. Has this been eating away at you for some time?

"
8443,18 december 2016,virgo,"Energetic Mars has been barreling through your house of efficiency in recent weeks, and chances are you’re fried. Today the cosmos tells you to put up your feet and relax a bit. You’re going to need some energy, babe. Tomorrow the red planet moves into your house of serious commitment, so make sure that you’re refreshed for some hot blooded amour!

"
8444,19 december 2016,virgo,"Romantic liaisons could face a bumpy ride over the next three weeks! Assertive Mars barrels into your commitment sector today, firing up the urge to merge. But Mercury retrogrades in the romance sector, warning you to slow down before you make any major decisions: getting engaged, moving in together, having a baby or taking the next big step. Singles, you could meet a serious contender but don’t start picking out baby names after the first date. Couples need to put old issues and dramas to rest, once and for all.

"
8445,20 december 2016,virgo,"Romantic liaisons can take a big leap forward now that energetic Mars is in your house of commitment. Better yet is that the Sun enters the highly romantic fifth house on Wednesday, making the next four weeks one of your best times in years to enjoy all the goodies that come with a love relationship. Singles, you’re not left out of this conversation! Your aspects for meeting someone new are excellent; just make sure that you vet them thoroughly before announcing to the world that this is The One.

"
8446,21 december 2016,virgo,"Love relationships are going through an interesting, flirty little dance these days. The “just dating” crowd may be getting more serious, attached Virgos are ready for more romantic quality time alone, and singles are poised to meet someone new. The week after Christmas is packed with lovely aspects that will put a smile on your face. Forget about work and chores for awhile and just think about love.

"
8447,22 december 2016,virgo,"Your desire to bust out of financial constraints is increasing, Virgo, but which is the best path to take? That will be the question over the next week or so, and it’s wise to be reflecting upon this as the new year approaches. You can make a lot of headway but it may involve a risk. Are you ready to take one?

"
8448,23 december 2016,virgo,"Words can flow much easier than usual today when it comes to communicating with a loved one or business partner. As a matter of fact, the entire week after Christmas is full of days with the same positive aspects, so don’t think that you have to get everything out in the open right now. The new moon on the 29th is wonderful for opening up a fresh chapter, especially with your lover and kids.

"
8449,24 december 2016,virgo,"A romance could make a sudden U-turn today, but in a positive way! It’s time to shake up your love life with a juicy new chapter, so think about what you could do to liven things up. Singles, a soulful new amour could be on the horizon so keep watch. The new moon on the 29th is a banner time for opening up new chapters in love.

"
8450,25 december 2016,virgo,"Ever the organized creature, you’re already thinking about what you’d like to get rolling in 2017. That’s because Venus is quite active today in your house of strategizing, paying no attention to the fact that it’s a holiday. But as you make your plans, consider how you can add more spice and creativity into your life. The new moon on the 29th falls in your house of artistic flair, so go bold!

"
8451,26 december 2016,virgo,"Quitting the day job in order to follow your bliss may be on your mind today as an unusual Jupiter-Uranus aspect asks you to examine your career path. You could also be questioning which way to go in a romance–staying in an existing relationship (which may not be very rewarding) or seeking a soulmate who thrills you to the core. No need to make a decision today: Thursday brings two aspects that will help point you in the right direction.

"
8452,28 december 2016,virgo,"Buddha said that enlightenment is the “end of suffering”, and that’s a wise piece of advice for everyone. You weren’t put on this planet to be like Oliver Twist with his bowl in hand, begging for “More, sir!” Hell no! Some enlightening aspects today encourage you to start living a more passionate life, one that you design. Resolve to make 2017 the year that you are good to yourself.

"
8453,29 december 2016,virgo,"If your love life has been somewhat on the dull side, that’s about to change! Today’s new moon in Capricorn ushers in a highly romantic phase. Past problems such as jealousy and resentment should start to fade as you are able to communicate with a lover more openly. Singles, the next six months could bring in someone new so keep your eyes peeled. All Virgos should be entering a period of more intimacy and soulful connections.

"
8454,30 december 2016,virgo,"Time to schedule a play date only for grown-ups! With the Sun in the friskiest part of your chart in fine form today, why don’t you plan a special outing just for you and your closest connections? Better yet, plan a number of them for 2017. With Neptune in your money house you can come up with budget friendly options that won’t break the bank.

"
8455,31 december 2016,virgo,"If saving up money to buy a home (or to remodel one) is on your list of resolutions for 2017, you’re in luck. Several positive aspects are working in your favor thanks to the planet of discipline, Saturn, in an active mood. This is your best year in over a decade to earn more and sock money away, so consider what you can do to increase your pay over the next 12 months.

"
8456,1 january 2017,libra,"Practicality rules your resolution setting sessions! Several planets in your house of streamlining and organizing will help you get 2017 off to a busy and sensible start. If you’re interested in developing a buff body, this is your year, as super motivator Mars is in your house of fitness. Just don’t go crazy with over-the-top boot camp regimens or lettuce-only diets, a possibility under the current aspects.

"
8457,2 january 2017,libra,"You have a lot of good things coming your way this year, Libra, but you shouldn’t be shouldering the burden of all of the work! Today’s a good time to let others around you know that they have to pick up some of the slack. You’re in the mood to cut through your tasks like a hot knife through butter, but if you try to take on too much yourself, you’ll be burned out before January is over.

"
8458,3 january 2017,libra,"Work that body, Libra. Get-gorgeous Venus is now in your house of vitality and fitness, making it easier than ever to get in shape. Start eating healthier foods, do a detox or cleanse, take vitamins, resolve to get more sleep and kick off an exercise regimen. With disciplined Saturn in your house of socializing, one of the best ways to achieve your goals is to work out with a fitness buddy, someone who’ll keep you accountable.

"
8459,4 january 2017,libra,"Diplomacy is the name of the game between now and the 12th as Mercury retrogrades into your communications sector! Actually this can be a positive situation as personal matters that were bubbling before the holidays can be discussed and resolved. It’s also a good time to review any term papers or dissertations that are due (not to mention getting ready for final exams), a manuscript, marketing plan or blog post. The full moon on the 12th falls in your career sector, so make sure that presentations and resumes are spit and polished.

"
8460,5 january 2017,libra,"Cat got your tongue? It wouldn’t be surprising considering that chatty Mercury is retrograde in your verbal third house. And with a number of planetary aspects making you quite emotional about family and romance matters, this could be an up and down day. Don’t expect this to change overnight though—as the weekend gets nearer, your feelings could bubble up to the surface even more. This is a necessary catharsis, however, and when Mercury resumes direct motion on the 8th you’ll be able to discuss things with the people who matter most.

"
8461,6 january 2017,libra,"Yes, Mercury is  retrograde in your communication sector, but today the emotional Moon forms a sparkling aspect to it from your relationship zone. This means that you can make some worthy attempts to hash things out with a lover. No problems in your love life? Then God bless you, my child! Take this super opportunity to enjoy dinner in a cozy cafe where the two of you can really talk—no texting allowed!

"
8462,7 january 2017,libra,"Some major transitions are on the horizon in your personal life as metamorphic Pluto meets up with the Sun. Your living arrangements could change as you may decide to transfer to another city or state or buy a new home. Maybe you and a lover move in together, or make plans to start a family. It could be an emotional time as family matters are front and center.With Mercury going direct tomorrow in your communication sector, this is the perfect time to straighten out family squabbles.

"
8463,8 january 2017,libra,"OK Libra, you can pull that sock out of your mouth now. Mercury has just gone direct in your communication sector. Not only will you be able to communicate with your loved ones more eloquently, but this should help your career too. The full moon this Thursday in your house of ambition and success is one of your best times in 2017 to make progress in finding a new job or higher levels of responsibility. Start the self-promotion right now.

"
8464,9 january 2017,libra,"As much as you would like to move forward with a particular situation, it appears that you’re getting ahead of yourself. The full moon that arrives on Thursday is in your house of ambition, and you may already be feeling its pull. The issue at hand is that things are not quite ready yet for forward movement, at least not this week. The second half of January is a far better time for developing momentum.

"
8465,11 january 2017,libra,"Sometimes you need to choose your words carefully and tiptoe around people; other times you just need to lay it on the line for them. And the cosmos is suggesting that you take the latter route. Your sign is known for its diplomatic approach, but with Mars in your uber-practical sixth house, be as frank as possible. Tomorrow’s full  moon helps you step into a place of more authority.

"
8466,12 january 2017,libra,"Got ambition? Then you’re going to be rewarded for it, courtesy if today’s full moon in the sector that governs success and goals. It could be a big win in your career or any other aspiration that you’ve been steadily working on. As full moons bring things to a close, you may decide to walk away from a job that doesn’t suit you and start searching for a better gig. The only fly in the ointment is that someone close may not support your plans, and this could come as a surprise. Next week is a better time to discuss matters and reach an agreement.

"
8467,13 january 2017,libra,"Get down to business! There’s a strong push from the cosmos for you to tie up loose ends and start moving forward. Yesterday’s full moon was all about your big ambitions for 2017. For now, just worry about what you can do to make things happen and forget about the cooperation or approval of others. It’s your show, Libra. Be the star.

"
8468,14 january 2017,libra,"Is it time to move on with your career? The recent full moon fell in that part of your chart, but it seems that you may be reluctant to make a change. A Venus-Neptune aspect could be encouraging you to take the “better the devil I know than the devil I don’t” viewpoint. Listen, if a job sucks the possibility exists that a better option exists. You won’t know unless you take some action.

"
8469,15 january 2017,libra,"Try not to get carried away with fears and worries about your closest relationships and what’s going on at the office. The emotional Moon is stirring up your your subconscious mind and it’s responding by dreaming up imaginary scenarios that probably won’t come to pass. Focus on reality this week, not what your gut is telling you, because your intuition is off kilter.

"
8470,16 january 2017,libra,"The planets warn that you have been pushing yourself too hard lately and unless you want to burn out, you need to some time for rest and relaxation. Like today and tomorrow. Charge up those batteries, Libra, because the Sun will be entering the most fun-filled part of your chart on Thursday. Then your focus will turn to love, getting out and enjoying the world, sports, hobbies and spending quality time with the people you love.

"
8471,17 january 2017,libra,"Loved ones could be hard to figure out over the next few days, as the Sun is forming some tense angles to Jupiter in your sign. Don’t be baffled by bulls*** or confused by mixed signals. Wait until Thursday to proceed, as the full moon will take place in your house of authority and Mercury will be in a better spot to help you communicate.

"
8472,18 january 2017,libra,"You’re in danger of becoming swamped by details, with your brain buzzing along like a hyperactive bee hive. Dynamic Mars is pushing you to get down to the nitty gritty and get things done, which is a good thing, but Jupiter may be making you overly optimistic as to what you can achieve in 24 hours! Today, consider streamlining your errands and protocols. Being busy all the time is not the same as being efficient.

"
8473,19 january 2017,libra,"Here’s the good news: energetic Mars is in your house of getting things done. No procrastination for you, Libra! Now for the downside: the red planet is pushing too hard. In your race to achieve your goals—lose weight, find a new job, get engaged—you may be overlooking key details or problems that need to be addressed first. Thought needs to be given to what it is that you’re trying to achieve. If you don’t slow down and consider your actions, you’ll just be like a hamster on a wheel.

"
8474,20 january 2017,libra,"An important new chapter is about to begin in romance now that El Sol is in your house of love. You’re in a practical mood too, not interested in flings or players. Make sure that you have healthy boundaries in place in an existing relationship; if you don’t, establish them before the new moon on the 27th. Singles, you need to set boundaries in advance by creating a short list of qualities you want in a mate and the behavior that you’re willing to accept—or not. Ask and you shall receive.

"
8475,21 january 2017,libra,"Building self-confidence can be a “one step forward, two steps back” kind of a situation. This weekend the Moon is in your house of self-esteem, forming a healing aspect with Chiron which is all about karma. The message from the cosmos is that you deserve to be happy, and with transformative Pluto by your side, major changes can happen. The 29th is a superb day for a breakthrough.

"
8476,22 january 2017,libra,"It’s the perfect day to toss your errands and to-do list to the side and to just go on a ramble in your town, or take a quick trip to a nearby city to soak up the culture. The Sun is in your house of enjoying life, which includes sports, entertainment, dining out, going to museums, checking out a street fair or indulging in hobbies. Carpe diem–seize the day!

"
8477,23 january 2017,libra,"Say what you mean and mean what you say. There’s no room for mixed signals under today’s planetary influences, at least where you’re concerned. Rational Saturn is allowing you to think clearly and express yourself with purpose. Avoid the temptation to bluster, flatter or cut corners with any projects that you may be working on. Likewise, keep your BS meter turned up all the way as people around you may be dishing it out.

"
8478,24 january 2017,libra,"If you’ve been considering a home decorating project, Libra, today’s the day to get started. Whether it requires major demolition and putting up new walls and electric, or just buying some new linens for the bedroom, it’s time to feather the nest. Planet of abundance, Jupiter, is now in your house of home and comfort through October. This is your best year in over a decade to turn your house or apartment into a castle. And while you’re at it, clean out those junk drawers. Neptune demands it.

"
8479,25 january 2017,libra,"You’ll be able to see through someone else’s bluster, a helpful situation as you need to get things done—and so do they. But is it wise to point out their ego or slacker ways? Tomorrow is a better day for that. For now, seize the initiative and just carry on. You may need to lay down the law with people in the weeks ahead, as Friday’s new moon tells you that you don’t have to be the work horse.

"
8480,26 january 2017,libra,"Sometimes you need to take a timeout just to analyze your routines and methods, and the cosmos wants you to do just that today. This is especially important in your career, as the two profits planets—Venus and Jupiter—are the orbs that are recommending this reflection. Obviously you can only control your own habits, and not those of other people you may need to work with. To thine own self be true.

"
8481,27 january 2017,libra,"Sweet! Tonight’s new moon in Aquarius is all about luscious love, Libra. Whether you’re single or attached a sizzling six-month chapter opens in which you can enjoy the company of a lover, not to mention indulge in hobbies and cultural events. It should be a highly social time so you’re urged to get out of the house, alone or as a couple. Domestic matters may crop up too, such as deciding to move in together, buy a place or start a family. Just make sure that you’re not doing all of the grunt work in a relationship, like the cooking, cleaning and rear end wiping.

"
8482,28 january 2017,libra,"Well aren’t you in a sweet spot, Libra! Yesterday’s Aquarian new moon fell in your house of romance—finding new love, juicing up the relationship you’re in now, enjoying life more—and today lusty Mars enters your house of commitment. If you’re in the market for a serious romance luck is on your side. February is looking like a terrific month for amour, so indulge. Creatives, these aspects are stellar for you as your talent is getting recognized by decision makers. The next few weeks are a smart time to retain an agent or gallery to represent you.

"
8483,29 january 2017,libra,"Setting boundaries with family members, roommates or even people who work in your home (contractors, nannies) may be necessary, Libra. You can’t do everything by yourself, nor should you. You need emotional support and the free time to get your own stuff done. When Jupiter retrogrades in your sign on February 6th, you could end up pulling away from some of this nonsense.

"
8484,30 january 2017,libra,"Heaven knows that most of us need to get inspired to do something about cluttered closets and desks piled high with papers, and today the cosmos is encouraging Libras to get their acts together. Start with your home base as Mercury and Pluto are demanding that your home environment runs as smooth as silk. Don’t worry, you’ll still have some fun this week. The Sun is in your frisky house of flirting, partying and living the luxe life until February 18th.

"
8485,31 january 2017,libra,"Distancing yourself from others, no matter how much you love them, is a smart thing to do from time to time, for no other reason than to recharge your batteries. It can also help you gain much needed perspective about the direction your alliance is heading in. The cosmos encourages you to nurture yourself, which may include not giving in to someone else’s demands. Take a day off just for you.

"
8486,1 february 2017,libra,"You’re about to enter a highly reflective time in which you’ll be questioning all that’s important to you, Libra. Jupiter will retrograde in your sign on the 6th, encouraging you to examine your priorities and connections. Today a tense lunar aspect might create a drama or disagreement with a partner, which could get this reflection started. Just know that love planet Venus will start helping you work out romantic issues as of this Friday.

"
8487,2 february 2017,libra,"Being selfless for love is fine in the movies and in romance novels, but in real life you could be asking yourself what the hell you’re thinking. It’s time to pay attention to the role you may be playing–as a lover, as a parent or a spouse. Is it your karma to be the one who’s doing all of the “heavy lifting” in a connection? No, it’s not, and the cosmos is pushing you to take care of your own needs (just as well as you take care of others).

"
8488,3 february 2017,libra,"Lucky Libra! Venus enters your commitment zone today, just in time for Valentine’s Day. This house governs business partnerships as well as romantic ones, so over the next four weeks you can make strides both in love and your career. But with Jupiter about to retrograde on Monday in your house of self, are you 100% in? An independent streak is rising.

"
8489,5 february 2017,libra,"Bitten off more than you can chew? That may be the case with a tense Moon-Neptune square. Don’t kid yourself, Libra. There are only 24 hours in a day. When Jupiter retrogrades tomorrow in your sign you’ll have the next four months to pick and choose among the various options open to you. It may be time to pare back on some of your less exciting activities.

"
8490,6 february 2017,libra,"Hmmm…should I or shouldn’t I? You may hesitate more than usual before plunging in to new opportunities now that mighty Jupiter has begun to spin backward in Libra. This includes everything from romance to surgery to getting a pet! Jupiter is a philosophical planet, and when it retrogrades it causes intense reflection. Which is smart, because between now and early June you can take your time and make more informed decisions. People around you may get twitchy because you won’t be as quick to collaborate, but that’s their problem! Besides, you’re not entering a monastery—you’re just being more discerning, that’s all.

"
8491,7 february 2017,libra,"A new level of closeness can be reached with the people you hold near and dear, Libra! Mercury is now in your social, fun-loving fifth house. You certainly can be more spontaneous, perhaps even dramatic. But with mighty Jupiter retrograding in your sign, you will be maintaining boundaries too, a smart move. Just because you’re open and expressive doesn’t mean that others should be able to walk all over you.

"
8492,8 february 2017,libra,"Someone in your surroundings could act out, and your initial response may be to fight fire with fire. The emotional Moon in the most authoritative part of your chart might create a “who the hell do you think you are?” kind of attitude on your part. The cosmos advises that you let this go. On Friday a helpful Jupiter-Saturn aspect will help you set things straight.

"
8493,9 february 2017,libra,"Creative juices flow as surprise-a-minute Uranus sparks some fresh ideas in that head of yours. But two heads are better than one in this case, so share the wealth with someone who’s simpatico. Teamwork will be a big part of your life over the next six months as Friday’s lunar eclipse occurs in this part of your chart. You’ll be able to accomplish more with others than on your own.

"
8494,10 february 2017,libra,"Your closest connections are about to undergo a major overhaul, thanks to a sparkling eclipse in Leo. Feeling lonely? This lunation occurs in the sector that governs making friends and enjoying their company, so expect some new faces to enter your life. Even if you’re quite social and have a devoted tribe, you will still make connections. Networking is what it’s all about, whether you’re looking for a new job, a potential spouse or you want to give back to the community. The people you know could end up introducing you to influential people, so don’t sit at home in front of the TV over the next few months.

"
8495,11 february 2017,libra,"A happy development could arise in your life over the next few days, and it could be something as simple as enjoying a fresh new attitude. Today a meeting between the two  most optimistic orbs, Jupiter and the Sun, does wonders for your self-esteem. A burst of creativity, the desire to relax and play and feeling more affectionate are all in the stars.

"
8496,12 february 2017,libra,"It will be hard to discern fact from fiction today Libra, so don’t even try. The Moon is in your highly intuitive twelfth house, which is usually a bonus, but today it opposes deceptive Neptune. Obviously you should’t make any major decisions under this aspect. Wait until Saturday if you can, when the Sun enters your practicality sector.

"
8497,13 february 2017,libra,"From your chart it appears that you need to get issues out on the table with someone close. However, the Moon in the most secluded part of your chart may be making you reluctant to say your piece. Perhaps you feel as though you don’t have enough information to proceed and you’re counting on your intuition to give you the scoop. That’s OK. By tomorrow you’ll feel bolder and more in charge about speaking your mind.

"
8498,14 february 2017,libra,"If there was ever a time to let your lover know just how you feel, it’s today, Libra! Saturn in your expressive third house is encouraging you to spill. Singles, with the Moon and Jupiter in your sign, your self-confidence and charisma should be going through the roof. However, you may end up having so much fun flirting that you decide to “share the wealth”. Who needs to be tied down?!

"
8499,15 february 2017,libra,"Try to keep drama to a minimum in partnership, be it romantic or personal. A tense Moon-Mars opposition could stir up emotions, especially if you’ve been overly optimistic about the direction an alliance is heading in. This doesn’t mean that the union will fall apart, but that you need to slow down and be realistic.

"
8500,16 february 2017,libra,"Creatively speaking, you’re on a hot streak, Libra. Mercury is stirring up your brain to come up with inventive ways of handling problems and making things happen. As a result, don’t dismiss an idea as being outlandish or impractical. You could actually be on to something.

"
8501,17 february 2017,libra,"Stuck in a creative quagmire? The right words may not come today; brilliant ideas might not flow. Fortunately it’s a temporary blip on the cosmic radar and will ease up on Monday. However, the planets are  advising that you develop more structure when it comes to brainstorming. For example, set aside 30 minutes each day to draw, write, meditate or get the creative juices flowing.

"
8502,18 february 2017,libra,"Finally ready to shed those pounds and get fit? The mighty Sun enters your fitness zone today for four weeks, which it does every year at this time. But what makes this season different is the solar eclipse that will occur on the 26th, the last in a series that has been going on since 2015. If you’ve already been taking good care of your health and physique, this could be the last final push that you need. But if you’re overweight and can’t touch your toes, this lunation should light a fire under you to work that body.

"
8503,19 february 2017,libra,"You’re entering a very practical phase now that the Sun is in Pisces, and your attention to detail will count for a lot. This isn’t just at the workplace–your personal appearance and close relationships could also benefit from a strong focus to the little things. Today and tomorrow are good for examining what’s going on with your lover, and kids too.

"
8504,20 february 2017,libra,"Just how willing are you to be a team player? From your chart it seems that you could be more interested in just having fun and flirting these days. There’s nothing wrong with that, Libra–you’re currently going through an independent streak with Jupiter retrograde in your sign. If someone tries to hem you in, they could be in for a big surprise.

"
8505,21 february 2017,libra,"Playfulness, feeling carefree, enjoying life–these are all on the cosmic menu today with a happy Mercury-Jupiter trine. The planets are encouraging you to live for yourself a little bit more, a wise piece of advice. Keep it in mind tomorrow as a tough aspect could remind you that you don’t have to kowtow to the people in your personal life.

"
8506,22 february 2017,libra,"We all have emotional baggage; some people seem determined to hold on to it more than others. The cosmos is telling you to let go, which may not be easy as subterranean Pluto is stirring up memories of past dramas. The question is this–do you really want to let the garbage from the past put a damper on current or future relationships with others? It’s your choice, Libra.

"
8507,23 february 2017,libra,"Your ideas, talents and personality will be in the spotlight, so make sure that you shine! Long term Saturn is on your side, helping you forge connections (which includes love) that will stand the test of time. Don’t be shy about expressing your opinions or showcasing plans that mean a lot to you.

"
8508,24 february 2017,libra,"An interesting mix of flirty romance and down-to-Earth practicality is in the air, Libra. This is a good weekend to pursue matters of the heart while you tackle the less glamorous aspects of your life, such as errands. You’ll need to schedule in more time for fun and amour in the weeks ahead as you’re about to enter a more businesslike, constructive phase.

"
8509,25 february 2017,libra,"If people around you aren’t carrying their fair share of the load, it’s time to make some noise about it. This goes for your home environment as well as work. Now that chatty Mercury is in your sixth house of getting things done, you can (politely) demand that they stop their slacker ways. However, tomorrow’s solar eclipse in the same sector may push you beyond your usually generous and diplomatic limits.

"
8510,26 february 2017,libra,"The Pisces solar eclipse kicks open a new six-month phase in which you’ll be hell bent on getting organized and productive. But unless everyone around you is also a Libra, you may face some resistance, particularly from a spouse, lover or business partner. Hey, you weren’t put on this Earth to be a domestic goddess or the office grunt work god. Put others on notice that you expect them to pull their own weight.

"
8511,27 february 2017,libra,"It’s important to keep a clear and open mind about relationships, Libra. Optimistic Jupiter is at loggerheads today with lusty and assertive Mars, which could make you do something foolish. Like: pick an argument; race into a relationship with someone who’s wrong for you; decide to cut ties prematurely; or become jealous or fearful. Don’t make any major decisions until these two have moved on in their orbits.

"
8512,28 february 2017,libra,"A series of planetary aspects over the past few days has been pitting your needs against those of others around you, and today you just might be so tired of it that you’ll be tempted to give in. The problem is that once they know you’re willing to wave the white flag, they’ll try to take advantage of you again. Not happening. Stand your ground.

"
8513,1 march 2017,libra,"Everyone says that they want to be organized and lead a less stressful life as a result, but not everyone takes action. You, however, are being pushed by the cosmos to swing into action. An inspirational Sun-Neptune meeting will not only motivate you into knocking things off your to-do list, but to beautify your work environment as well. Whether you go mid-century modern, shabby chic or feng shui, make your work space as beautiful as it is functional.

"
8514,2 march 2017,libra,"Ever since Jupiter entered your sign last fall, your desire to live your life your  way has been increasing—and today things may reach critical mass. An intense Jupiter-Uranus opposition could find you getting ready to walk away from people and situations that aren’t honoring who you really are. When Venus retrogrades on Saturday, this feeling will intensify. Between now and April 2nd you may be making some big decisions.

"
8515,3 march 2017,libra,"How to bring passion back into your life is the question the cosmos poses to you today, Libra. “Passion” doesn’t mean just love and lust—it can also refer to the joy you bring (or don’t!) to your work and hobbies. You’ve recently had some difficult aspects in the relationship department, so you may want to start there first. If a business or romantic alliance has lost its luster, is there a way to revive it? Or is it time to move on?

"
8516,4 march 2017,libra,"Are you in, or are you out? Love planet Venus retrogrades in your commitment sector, possibly shaking up your plans for the future. You may decide to hold off on getting married, moving in with someone or starting a family. While the retrograde period lasts until April 2nd, relief arrives on March 13th as diplomatic Mercury enters the same part of your chart. Reluctance may also arise when it comes to a business alliance. Next week is a good time to work out issues before you end up making a major decision.

"
8517,5 march 2017,libra,"Set the record straight, Libra. Mature Saturn tells you to be forthright with the people closest to you. This is no time for concealing your feelings or opinions, nor playing passive-aggressive games. If you need to revisit the past do so, if only to create a better future.

"
8518,6 march 2017,libra,"Focus on practical details and the fastest way to get things done, Libra. A potent conjunction of the Sun and Mercury in the most efficient part of your chart will help you strategize. Declutter, streamline and bring order to your life both at home and at work.

"
8519,7 march 2017,libra,"The planets are pulling you in different directions, making you feel as though you don’t have time for everything on your plate. Your work demands may be overwhelming you to the point where there’s no energy left for family or your own personal time. Here’s a hint from the cosmos: start creating boundaries at the office. Free up precious hours for your loved ones and your own enjoyment.

"
8520,8 march 2017,libra,"Work that body! The ability to transform your physique and feel more vibrant while you’re at it is in the stars, Libra. The next week is super for initiating an exercise routine and better eating habits. Considering that the full moon on the 12th falls in your house of surgery, physical therapy and major healing, you can also take care of serious health issues over the next few months.

"
8521,9 march 2017,libra,"You’re about to enter a touchy time, Libra. Love planet just retrograded in your house of commitment. And today Mars enters an associated sector, the house of intimacy and sexuality. Let’s put it this way—any issues in your relationship will come bubbling to the surface, either quietly or with an explosion. The full moon coming on Sunday is in your house of closure. Either make peace with your lover or move on. Singles, get straight on what you really want in love.

"
8522,10 march 2017,libra,"Roles may need to be revised in a team effort, along with changes in procedure, but you’ll be able to work with that today. Let others know that in order for things to run smoothly that they need to do their fair share and cooperate. You’ve been working hard lately, Libra, too hard. Establish boundaries and expectations, then step aside.

"
8523,11 march 2017,libra,"In order to stay on top of your many activities and responsibilities, you may need to adjust your attitude about just how much stuff you can handle! Abundant Jupiter may have you think that you can multitask like nobody’s business, but the reality is that you can’t. Actually now is a great time to delegate or hire people who can do some of the grunt work for you.

"
8524,12 march 2017,libra,"A highly cathartic full moon takes place this evening, Libra, and you can benefit enormously by letting past dramas go. Sometimes you need to talk things over with others in order to feel better, but not this time. You can do a lot of inner healing on your own. If you try to communicate with others they may just put up resistance. You know your truth—accept it and be happy with it

"
8525,13 march 2017,libra,"Who deserves to stay in your orbit, and who should be sent to another galaxy? A number of planets are shining their light on your closest connections. Yesterday’s full moon is helping you to create a short list while Mercury’s entry into Aries will help you talk things over. Watch out for drama, though, as aggressive Mars is in your house of passion.

"
8526,14 march 2017,libra,"Moody blues? You could experience them today as La Luna stirs up your feelings. You could face opposition from a lover or family members, and the key is to be as realistic as possible about what’s going on. Don’t let optimism, passion or emotions guide your thoughts and actions today.

"
8527,15 march 2017,libra,"Setting positive new habits should be a snap today with a strong Moon-Saturn connection. Sometimes you just have to realize that your existing routines aren’t taking you where you want to go. If that’s the case, self reflect, decide a few things you’d like to change, and swing into action.

"
8528,16 march 2017,libra,"Are too many chefs spoiling the sauce? Could be with the aspects on offer today and tomorrow! Neptune is in a great spot for Libras, helping them become inspired and run with their ideas. But if too many people get involved you run the risk of others mucking things up and creating delays. Your best bet is to work solo, at least until Monday when the Sun enters your partnership zone.

"
8529,17 march 2017,libra,"Doctor’s orders! The planets warn that you should be paying attention to what your body is telling you, Libra, along with any health care professionals that you work with. If you don’t there could be a “reality check” coming your way. While it doesn’t appear to be life threatening, it could throw you off your feet for awhile. Why tempt fate? Be a good boy or girl and take your medicine.

"
8530,18 march 2017,libra,"This has been an interesting year for you especially in relationships, as Jupiter has been stirring up an independent streak. But that all begins to change this weekend as a yummy Venus-Mercury convo gets you more interested in bonding with someone on a deeper level. Once the Sun moves into Aries on Monday things will heat up considerably, so get back into the game.

"
8531,19 march 2017,libra,"Say what you mean and mean what you say. A meet up of stern Saturn and the emotional Moon helps you put your thoughts and feelings out there. You may need to remind people where you’re coming from later this week when a tough T-square takes place on Thursday and Friday. Protect your time and peace of mind.

"
8532,20 march 2017,libra,"Is it time to find new love—or grow closer to the person who is already in your life? Singles, are you ready to end your days in the desert–or do you want to remain footloose and fancy free for awhile? Now that the Sun is in Aries, your partnership sector, these are some of the thoughts that will be going through your mind. Happily attached Libras can grow even closer to their amour. The next four weeks can be game changers.

"
8533,21 march 2017,libra,"You may feel like doing what you want these days, thanks to optimistic Jupiter in your sign, but it would be smart to consider the needs and viewpoints of others. Does this mean, though, that you have to bend to their will? Hell no! Just listen, as they may have some valuable input. Then make your own decisions and sally forth.

"
8534,22 march 2017,libra,"A struggle may be arising within you concerning your priorities. What’s more important—your family or your career? Taking some down time for yourself or spending every free moment with your amour? Handling your work load all by yourself or aligning with a partner who can carry some of it with you? Consider your options today. By the weekend you may end up making some important decisions.

"
8535,23 march 2017,libra,"It’s your life, Libra. How do you want to spend your time, and with whom? What goals do you want to pursue? A tense aspect between pushy Pluto and verbal Mars indicates that someone close may try to clip your wings. Not happening! To thine own self be true.

"
8536,24 march 2017,libra,"My, are we a bit pessimistic today about an alliance—personal or business? It could be, courtesy of a Mercury-Jupiter smackdown in the skies. In astrology, its the outer planets that will prevail with their message, so optimistic Jupiter will win this battle. As a matter of fact, tomorrow is a good day to make amends with a partner—or for singles to find new love

"
8537,25 march 2017,libra,"The love train is chugging into town. The question is: do you want to get on board? If you’ve been on the fence about romance, a happy Venus-Sun connection today could dispel doubts. As a matter of fact the next six months are super for making progress in love, whether it’s an existing romance or a new one.

"
8538,26 march 2017,libra,"Get to the heart of the matter. Serious discussions with a lover can bear fruit with two helpful aspects in the heavens. There’s a spontaneous vibe to this, as if a conversation that is overdue is suddenly brought to the fore. It’s a smart time to talk about what may be on your mind, considering that the new moon on Tuesday opens up a fresh chapter in romance. Unattached Libras could meet someone between now and August who is both dreamy and practical at the same time.

"
8539,27 march 2017,libra,"Some new assignments or career opportunities could come your way, but you have to be on top of your game in order to run with them. Which means: polish up your resume, wrap up half-finished projects, make sure that you team knows what is expected of them, and empty out your e-mail account. Efficiency is what it’s all about.

"
8540,28 march 2017,libra,"Despite the fact that Jupiter has been encouraging you since October to march to the beat of your own drum, today’s new moon suggests that more cooperation with others should be considered. Therefore, if a relationship with a lover, family member or business partner has been tense, you’re being given an excellent opportunity to repair it. The lines of communication swing wide open tomorrow with a helpful Mercury-Saturn trine, the best aspect possible in astrology.

"
8541,29 march 2017,libra,"Serious discussions with loved ones and business connections can take place without drama and anger, thanks to sober, mature Saturn in a good angle. Try to get matters wrapped up with family members, room mates and spouses especially, as Thursday brings a difficult aspect. Let others know what you expect of them and that you intend to hold them to some new rules.

"
8542,30 march 2017,libra,"You’re in a great spot with abundant and optimistic Jupiter in your sign. It’s green lights ahead—but you have to make sure that you don’t go overboard, taking on too many tasks or expecting things to happen overnight. It’s also possible that someone in your circle may try to coerce you into doing things their way, as they recognize that you’re blazing your own path ahead. Stick to your own agenda.

"
8543,31 march 2017,libra,"Talk flirty to me. Heck, you can even talk a little dirty to me! Now that verbal Mercury is in the sexy house of libido you could turn into quite the lusty little devil. But this is also the house of deep, intimate talks that take place on a more soulful level. So pour your heart out to your amour, and do it before Mercury retrogrades on April 9th. Singles, send out an APB that you’re on the market and looking for love.

"
8544,1 april 2017,libra,"This month’s full moon on the 11th is in your sign, Libra, which will put the spotlight on you. Considering a bikini-buff body for the summer months as part of being in that spotlight? If that’s the case, then get ready to polish up your physique as glamour girl Venus begins to retrograde tomorrow through your house of fitness. Research your options. Which diet to go on? Work out at the gym, or start jogging outside? Yoga or Pilates? How about beefing up your vitamin intake? Then get ready to swing into gear, especially after the 15th when Venus resumes direct motion.

"
8545,2 april 2017,libra,"With next week’s full moon coming in your sign, it’s time to start planning the next six months of your life. Venus retrogrades today into your productivity sector, forcing you to examine your habits and routines. If you’re looking to develop a hotter body or more vibrant health this is the perfect time to do so, as glam Venus will be in the house of diet and exercise.

"
8546,3 april 2017,libra,"The Moon lights a fire underneath you to take care of your health and to work that body! Glamorous Venus just retrograded into this part of your chart yesterday, so if you decide to work out solely for looking sexy, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. You may have to go it alone, though. Trying to get your spouse to join you may be futile. The same goes for lining up an exercise buddy. Blaze your own path.

"
8547,4 april 2017,libra,"A colleague or business partner might act out today in a manner that you wouldn’t expect. Your initial reaction may be to blast them, thanks to the emotional Moon in your house of authority, but your best bet is to maintain your composure. This energy repeats itself on Friday, so it ain’t over quickly. Next Tuesday’s full moon in your sign, though, will put you in the driver’s seat. Wait until then to make your expectations clear.

"
8548,5 april 2017,libra,"Rally the troops and try to get everyone working toward the same goal, Libra. You’re in a good spot to be listened to, as inspirational Neptune is helping you come up with creative ideas to old problems. While not everyone will be sold on your ideas enough people will be–and that’s all you need.

"
8549,6 april 2017,libra,"Becoming a more polished person is possible, especially now that Saturn is retrograde in your house of self-expression. Over the next five months you can go back to school, perfect your public speaking skills, touch up your manuscript, and become more confident and social. This aspect is terrific for learning how to blog, finesse Photoshop or Illustrator, or write a screenplay. Opening up the lines of communication with your nearest and dearest should become easier as well.

"
8550,7 april 2017,libra,"With optimistic Jupiter in your sign you might be feeling mighty positive about what you can accomplish. There’s nothing wrong with that as long as you’re realistic about time frames, the resources you’ll need and expectations others have of you. The problem is that a tense Sun-Jupiter aspect may bring about resentment between you and others. Are they jealous of your motivation? Do they need more of your time? Or are you getting fed up with their demands? Next week’s full moon in Libra could bring all of this to a head.

"
8551,8 april 2017,libra,"Who’s doing all of the grunt work in your family? Make sure that it’s not you, a good possibility with two squares taking place in the heavens. Don’t let siblings, kids, parents or a lover dump their chores on you. Nor should you always be playing the role of the family counselor, confidante or enabler. Enough already. Next week’s full moon in Libra is all about you stepping out and living your own life. You can’t be burdened by everyone else’s problems.

"
8552,9 april 2017,libra,"Protect your net worth over the next few weeks as Mercury begins to retrograde in your house of finances. If possible, avoid borrowing large sums of money through the 20th, such as a mortgage or loan for your business. Can’t avoid it or can’t wait? Then double check the documents and numbers. The same holds true for credit cars statements, student loans, alimony and other court awards and inheritances. And curb your spending while you’re at it!

"
8553,10 april 2017,libra,"Are you willing to take some risks in order to live a more authentic life? A Moon-Jupiter meet up encourages you to pursue your passions, but you may have to do things that are past your comfort zone. Tomorrow’s full moon in your sign will give you the final kick in the pants that you need.

"
8554,11 april 2017,libra,"It’s showtime, baby! The once-a-year full moon in Libra occurs today, boosting your confidence and drive. With Saturn in a terrific angle form your house of communicating, this is an excellent time to promote an idea or your reputation. People will be interested in what you have to say, so don’t hold back. However, tough aspects involving Pluto and Uranus indicate that there could be resistance from family members or a lover. Remember: it’s your life.

"
8555,12 april 2017,libra,"You may have been burning the candle at both ends over the past month, ignoring your health while you’ve tended to errands and work assignments. Today’s planetary aspects tell you to get back on track with fitness and dieting. Once Venus resumes direct motion on Saturday you’ll be more interested in looking gorgeous, too!

"
8556,13 april 2017,libra,"Getting down to the basics is on the planets’ agenda, so don’t be surprised if you go into full feng shui mode at home or the office. An orderly, clean environment is one of the fundamentals of serene living, but in order to maintain it new habits and routines need to be established.

"
8557,14 april 2017,libra,"Relationships could turn on a dime today, thanks to a wonky Sun-Uranus conjunction. When these two meet up just about anything can happen. Chances are you’ll be quite vocal in either a business or romantic union, letting the other party know just how you feel and what you want. There’s no need to be dictatorial but if you’ve had enough, consider your other options.

"
8558,15 april 2017,libra,"Obsession, worrying, stress–you may have been dealing with all of these stinkers over the past month as Venus has been retrograde in your house of efficiency. Fortunately it moves back into direct motion today, so red tape, uncooperative co-workers and deadlined may ease up. This is also a good time to get back on track with taking better care of your body through sports and better nutrition.

"
8559,16 april 2017,libra,"Working more closely with other people is necessary, and as long as you can honor their opinions things should work out well. The next 48 hours are a good time to start developing some common ground with people both at home and at work. That’s not to say that others will always respect your  opinions, but current aspects are requiting diplomacy at your end.

"
8560,17 april 2017,libra,"This is one of the best times all year to showcase your ideas and talent, so don’t hold back! Projects that you initiate hold long term potential, so much so that people may want to collaborate with you on them. Before signing on the dotted line, however, do your homework on possible partners. Mercury is about to retrograde in this part of your chart on Thursday.

"
8561,18 april 2017,libra,"You may need to lay down some boundaries for the people closest to you, such as family or roommates…but with the Moon in an emotional spot you could be reluctant to do so. Don’t hold back, Libra! Pluto is about to retrograde in this part of your chart. The bottom line is that if you  don’t take control of matters now, other people will–and you’ll be stuck doing things their way.

"
8562,19 april 2017,libra,"Matters of the heart will occupy a good deal of your attention over the next few weeks as the Sun has just entered your house of passion and intimacy. But despite your desire to bond soulfully with another, Mercury’s retrograde turn on Thursday will find you questioning just how committed you are to the idea. Things will be up in the air through May 3rd, so be patient and don’t make any key decisions for now.

"
8563,20 april 2017,libra,"Are my relationships solid? You may be harboring these kinds of thoughts over the next few months, especially with family or a lover. Powerful Pluto retrogrades in your house of comfort and stability, making you question the strength of your connections. But this can be helpful as Pluto will point out to you the areas where you’re letting others take advantage of you. Go slowly and read between the lines when people are talking. If a relationship isn’t worth the trouble you’ll know soon enough.

"
8564,21 april 2017,libra,"Get ready for liftoff! Red hot Mars enters your bold and optimistic house of adventure. Start thinking out of the box and get ready to share your brilliance with others. There’s a strong profit vibe associated with this, so if you’re dreaming up money-making ideas it’s time to run with them. With Pluto retrograde in your house of security, chances are you won’t do anything too rash—like quitting the day job and opening up a tiki bar on the beach.

"
8565,22 april 2017,libra,"You may be gung ho about blasting through your tasks, whether at home or at work, but the cosmos tells you to dial things down a little bit. Stern Saturn warns that you need to pay attention to details, otherwise you might make a mistake. Likewise, you’re currently in danger of taking on more activities or work than a human being can possibly handle. Be discerning and choose only the best projects to pursue.

"
8566,23 april 2017,libra,"If looking at your buck naked body in the mirror is making you grimace rather than smiling proudly, then today’s the perfect time to start a diet and fitness routine. Who cares about your cholesterol level when looking hot will do? There’s a strong vanity thing going on thanks to Venus. But the good thing is that when you start taking care of yourself—for your ego, revenge on an ex, fitting into your old jeans—you’ll end up getting healthier and more vibrant. Which is also sexy, dontcha know.

"
8567,24 april 2017,libra,"Dynamic duos take flight with a winning Saturn-Mercury meet up! This could be a business deal or a romantic one, but either way the key is to communicate. Let someone know that you’re interested, discuss the terms of an upcoming arrangement (whether it’s your wedding or forming a corporation) and start working on the next step. The new moon on Wednesday will push things along even further.

"
8568,25 april 2017,libra,"With a new moon coming in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, becoming more intimate with a lover is in the stars. But it won’t happen unless the lines of communication are open, and a positive Uranus-Saturn aspect helps build them. Uranus acts quickly and encourages you to do things differently than before, so consider new ways to reach out to your amour.

"
8569,26 april 2017,libra,"A happier new phase in romance begins with the Taurus new moon in your house of intimacy and bonding. The lines of communication can swing wide open thanks to a spontaneous aspect between Uranus and Saturn. The ringed planet demands that relationship issues be handled logically and maturely, so count to ten and speak your piece.

"
8570,27 april 2017,libra,"Ready to set aside more cash in a retirement account or savings plan? Yesterday’s new moon was just the ticket for creating a winning strategy. But with demanding Pluto in your house of security and comfort, this won’t happen by magic. Pluto is the planet of personal power. You want more money in reserves? It’s up to you to make it happen.

"
8571,28 april 2017,libra,"Partnerships of all kinds can take a far more serious turn now that Venus is in your house of forming or strengthening alliances. But this golden girl is the planet of ease, so things should progress nicely without a lot of tension and disagreements. Mercury is retrograde, though, so don’t agree to anything major just yet, whether it’s in romance or business. Once Mercury goes direct on May 3rd you can commit with greater peace of mind.

"
8572,29 april 2017,libra,"Slow and steady wins the race every time, Libra, something to remind yourself of today. The Moon is in an impatient spot, anxious for more fun, faster results and more independence. But Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither will your life circumstances change overnight. Put in the time and any necessary effort, then wait for the manifestation to take place.

"
8573,30 april 2017,libra,"They say that you can’t go off on an exciting journey until you’re willing to leave the shore. While that may be true, and adventures may be calling your name, the planets are telling you to take care of the details first. Serious Saturn demands strategizing, discussion and deep thinking before you embark on anything  important—a marriage, business deal, going to grad school, launching a business, you name it.

"
8574,1 may 2017,libra,"Sometimes it seems as though the only person patting you on the back fro a job well done is yourself! That may be the case today with a Moon-Mercury square. Don’t expect others to be supportive, at least not in the early part of the week. Once Mercury resumes direct motion on Wednesday you’ll be able to speak your mind and let people know that you expect a little thanks and praise now and then.

"
8575,2 may 2017,libra,"“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams”. So said a very wise woman, Eleanor Roosevelt. And the beauty of your  dreams may become apparent today as the passionate Moon forms a dreamy aspect with Mars. But this isn’t just fantasizing about a future that will never come true. The full moon on the 10th falls in one of the most practical parts of your chart. Use its energy to fuel your passions.

"
8576,3 may 2017,libra,"The Love Boat, which has been stuck at the dock over the past few weeks thanks to Mercury in retrograde, is about to set sail—so climb on board! Relationship matters straighten out, singles have a better chance of meeting a keeper and your sex life might even improve. The Sun is in the sector that governs intimacy and libido, telling you to work things out with your lover in a practical way. This is not time for fantasy-fueled thinking.

"
8577,4 may 2017,libra,"A secretive Venus-Moon aspect might find you keeping your emotions to yourself—but is that wise? Sometimes people need to know what’s going on in that head of yours. They’re not mind readers, so sort out your thoughts and get ready to share them. Tomorrow is the perfect time to open up. And next week’s full moon in Scorpio will work wonders for your self-esteem.

"
8578,5 may 2017,libra,"Are you bringing sexy back? Where the hell did it go? Listen, losing your mojo is something that happens to all of us. Stress, fatigue, family pressures—it all builds up. But now it’s time to get back in touch with your inner groove thang. The Sun is in the most soulful, libidinous part of your chart, so let its rays warm you up.

"
8579,6 may 2017,libra,"It’s over.  Put a fork in it: it’s done. That may be your attitude as the Moon transits your house of closure. Sometimes ya just gotta get rid of the time and energy vampires that are sucking on us, which can include people as well as habits. If you decide to cut someone off, however, there’s no need to go public with it. Subtly pull away from them if you can.

"
8580,7 may 2017,libra,"A happy meeting of the Moon and Jupiter in your sign puts you in the mood for taking good care of yourself. So pamper away! And while you’re at it, the cosmos suggests taking better care of your health. With glamorous Neptune in your house of physique, looking gloriously sexy and fit is a real possibility.

"
8581,8 may 2017,libra,"You may not be too interested in what someone has to say today, especially if the other person is a close connection! But you should pay attention to them nonetheless as their words may carry some wisdom. None of us has all of the answers and we can benefit from other opinions and advice. Don’t be stubborn, because in the end you will make your own decisions anyway.

"
8582,9 may 2017,libra,"Serious relationships are front and center this week, thanks to a powerful Pluto-Sun trine today. This is a game changer as it will force you to make a decision about the future of a bond. Emotions will be high as these two orbs are in the most intimate and security-conscious parts of your chart. But logic will also be in play as tomorrow’s full moon falls in a very practical sector.

"
8583,10 may 2017,libra,"Sweet! A full moon in your income sector could wrap up plans that you’ve been working on to earn more. From your chart it appears that other people could end up being influential in your future success: a business partner, booking agent, attorney, angel investor or mentor. Don’t be afraid to ask someone for advice or assistance as they could be the missing key you need to develop a stronger income. If you’re considering a real estate purchase, the aspects are excellent.

"
8584,11 may 2017,libra,"You’re in quite a strategic phase these days, Libra, thanks to a number of planets helping you brainstorm, negotiate, sign deals and line up financing. By the way, this goes for your personal life as well as your career: finding a partner, getting engaged or working as a couple to develop a strong financial base. But a difficult Mars-Neptune square today indicates that some of your plans may need to be scaled back. You may be in such a rush to get somewhere that you’re overlooking key details. Slow down before you make a mistake.

"
8585,12 may 2017,libra,"It’s no secret that with expansive Jupiter in your sign since last fall, you of all the signs should be going after your heart’s desire, whatever that may be. Jupiter is the planet of abundance and optimism (and profits too!). Well, today the cosmos slaps some rocket boosters on to this situation as red hot, motivational Mars forms a fabulous trine with Jupiter. The sky truly is the limit, so get ready for liftoff.

"
8586,13 may 2017,libra,"Excellent day to have serious talks with a loved one. The emotional Moon is in the most verbal part of your chart, which sometimes leads to hysterical blabbering. But that won’t happen as La Luna is in a conjunction with sober, rational Saturn. So speak your piece as your words will have gravitas. And if you need to speak to a counselor, confidante or mentor about something important it’s an auspicious day to do so. Becoming more mentally balanced is what it’s all about.

"
8587,14 may 2017,libra,"If you’re stuck in a creative rut at the office it’s time to dig yourself out, Libra. Regardless as to what you do for a living, the big bucks and kudos go to those who bring fresh ideas to the marketplace. Doing things the same old way makes you a good soldier but doesn’t differentiate you from the crowd. Fortunately inspirational Neptune has your back, helping you approach things from a far more innovative viewpoint.

"
8588,15 may 2017,libra,"You have some strong opinions these days, but that doesn’t mean that everyone will see things your way. That’s OK–you should still voice your opinions. With serious Saturn in your communication sector you’ll say what you mean and mean what you say. If others can’t take it, don’t sweat it. You’ve done your part.

"
8589,16 may 2017,libra,"Put on your Sherlock Holmes hat and whip out the magnifying glass: perceptive Mercury is in your eighth house, the place of digging deep, whether that means your emotions, someone else’s (not to mention their agenda) or simply conducting research about a business opportunity. I suppose you could start snooping your lover’s texts and e-mails—a possibility under this aspect—but you really won’t have to. Mercury’s intelligence will help you ferret out the truth in a situation without you having to go “undercover”.

"
8590,17 may 2017,libra,"Social invitations will be coming your way and you should definitely take advantage of them! Today your magnetism is off the charts, thanks to a happy Moon-Jupiter aspect. Use it to flirt, win people over, promote yourself and simply have more fun. Once the Sun enters Gemini this weekend you will be meeting folks who are a different breed than the people you’re used to, so prepare to have an open mind.

"
8591,18 may 2017,libra,"A critical Venus-Jupiter opposition warns you to not get carried away in romance. It’s all well and good to feel amorous but sometimes ya just gotta keep it real, seeing your partner for who they are. This holds for singles who are searching for a mate as well as those long-attached Libras. Putting someone on a pedestal, refusing to acknowledge problems in a relationship, being way too anxious to settle down and get married—all of these will backfire unless you’re operating with some logical thought.

"
8592,19 may 2017,libra,"If you need to get something off your chest with a lover or business partner, today’s the day! A sparkling and unusual Uranus-Saturn trine urges you to stop holding back and to open up. It’s also an auspicious moment to discuss new possibilities and plans, things that you may not have considered before but sound enticing. A fresh chapter opens up that will take you into mid-November, allowing you to take a more relaxed attitude about your role in the relationship.

"
8593,20 may 2017,libra,"Your life over the next four weeks may seem like a brain-a-thon, thanks to the Sun’s movement into one of the most mental parts of your chart. This is the ninth house, and we certainly don’t think small when this sector is activated. Taking risks, trying new endeavors, getting out there and learning about the world through travel and study—that’s what it’s all about. In addition, serious Saturn happens to be occupying the other  house of the mind, the third house. As a result you’ll be dreaming up all sorts of brilliant ideas. Be careful, though, that you don’t try to sway others into your way of thinking as pushy Mars is on the scene. Got a great notion? Then run with it, but don’t expect overnight success or for everyone to be as enthralled as you are.

"
8594,21 may 2017,libra,"Hmm, someone’s feeling adventurous these days and they look an awful lot like Libras! That’s because the Sun just entered the most free wheeling, optimistic part of your chart. And today the luscious Moon tells you to take a chance in romance, whether that means dating a different type or grabbing your lover and doing something fun that you’ve never tried before. (That does include the boudoir, by the way.)

"
8595,22 may 2017,libra,"This is not a day to play the Lone Ranger, sticking to your guns and not cooperating. Nope, pardner, compromise and communication are key as charming Venus meets up with the Moon. You can get much further these days if you play nice with others. Word to the wise: let them do most of the talking and keep your opinions to yourself.

"
8596,23 may 2017,libra,"Got a brilliant idea, say, for writing a book, launching a business or embarking on some new kind of adventure? Not surprising with energetic Mars in this part of your chart, and a new moon occurring here on Thursday. The smartest thing you can do right now is to take bold plans and break them into “bite-sized” pieces. Otherwise overwhelm will quickly set in. And from your chart it appears that you may not get as much help from others as you might like, so plan on doing a lot on your own.

"
8597,24 may 2017,libra,"From your chart it appears that you need some down time, whether you’re single or attached, have kids or don’t. Today’s a good time to relax and play a bit, or even just to sit outdoors in nature and meditate. Tomorrow’s new moon falls in your house of adventure and risk taking, so get ready to turn up the dial when it comes to having fun. Don’t feel so tied down to your chores at home or your family demands that you don’t block out time for yourself.

"
8598,25 may 2017,libra,"Who or what is holding you back? Identifying these problems is the key to finessing today’s new moon, which occurs in the most adventurous part of your chart. Get ready to take a calculated risk. It’s possible that with Saturn in Sagittarius, you may be feeling more cautious than is necessary. And if a lover or family members are getting in your way, you may need to put them on notice to butt out—you’ve got a life to live.

"
8599,26 may 2017,libra,"There’s nothing better than having some adventure, and considering that the Sun is now in this part of your chart you’re more than ready for some new experiences! And isn’t it nice of the cosmos to deliver some your way this weekend. But you won’t be having fun just by yourself. Grab your honey or some pals and plan away. You weren’t destined to hide in the shadows, so get out in the sunshine and play!

"
8600,27 may 2017,libra,"You’re certainly not suffering from a shortage of lofty ideas. The problem is choosing which ones to run with! Megawatt Mars has your brain more stirred up than a beehive that someone just rattled. Slow down, pour yourself a cuppa or glass of Pinot, and really think about your next move. This weekend is a good time to confide in a good friend or mentor and seek their advice.

"
8601,28 may 2017,libra,"Pay attention to some of the deep thoughts that have been bubbling in your mind lately as they hold the key to a better future. Right now is the perfect time to merge your intuitive thoughts with more logical ones. Being inspired is always wonderful, but not everyone acts upon their ideas. You can, thanks to the presence of Neptune in your house of getting things done.

"
8602,29 may 2017,libra,"Someone may hit you with a lot of hard questions today, courtesy of aggressive Mars being in a militant mood. They may demand guarantees or a leaner budget or a promise that things will change. This could occur in any area of your life, so get ready to be challenged. On the flip side, you  may be the one asking all of the questions. Uncertainty and hesitation are in the air, but the good thing is that this passes quickly. Just avoid making snap decisions until you know more.

"
8603,30 may 2017,libra,"Support may come from an unexpected source, Libra. You’ve got some pretty big plans in mind and this is no time to try to go it alone. Reach out to others, people who may have traveled down the path you want to trod. Uranus, planet of genius, has your back and can put you in touch with folks who will share their wisdom.

"
8604,31 may 2017,libra,"You’ll be able to think with both your head and your heart as intelligent Mercury has taken up residence in the house of deep emotions. Helping him along is subterranean Pluto, an expert at ferreting out issues that need to be dealt with. This is a cathartic aspect, so allow yourself to be vulnerable and work your way through it.

"
8605,1 june 2017,libra,"Your power of persuasion is ramping up, Libra, and the next week or two are crucial for getting your opinions out there. This holds true in matters of the heart as well as business. If you think that retaining an expert, such as a PR agent or booking agent, will help your career, today is excellent for holding talks. It’s also an auspicious time for having heart to heart convos with your amour, talking about where you’re headed.

"
8606,1 june 2016,libra,"Stalling tactics! You’re raring to go, whether it’s blasting through your household chores or the pile on your desk at the office. But someone  seems determined to throw a monkey wrench into the works. WTF? The culprit is a difficult square between Neptune and the Sun. Coworkers or family members could be either indecisive or deliberately ornery. Put on your seat belt. This continues into the weekend.

"
8607,2 june 2017,libra,"This may easily be one of the best times all year to go and shout it from the mountaintops. What is the “it” I’m referring to? Your idea for a screenplay or manuscript. Your marketing campaign or a video that you want to go viral. Your opinion about what needs to be changed in our political system, followed up with a concrete plan for taking action. Your brand and why people should pay attention to it. Your desire to improve yourself, whether that’s via education or by delving into a new philosophy. Go for it!

"
8608,2 june 2016,libra,"Yum! What a good day for sharing your deepest thoughts with someone you love. The passionate Moon in the most intimate part of your chart forms a marvelous angle with the North Node, suggesting that healing is on the way. Neptune is also helpful, wanting you to develop a greater sense of security. Make sure to spend some quiet, quality time with your amour.

"
8609,3 june 2017,libra,"It’s always time to celebrate when the two most optimistic orbs in the solar system unite, and that’s what happening today. Lucky Jupiter trines the fiery Sun, telling you to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight. If you’ve been secretly harboring a desire or a dream, now’s the time to stop thinking about it and actually do something about it. With intense Mars entering your house of goals and ambition tomorrow, the next eight weeks are superb for developing momentum as you move into a new way of living.

"
8610,3 june 2016,libra,"Picky, picky, picky. A planetary slugfest (also known as a Grand Cross) is turning Libra into quite the choosy one. Too bad you can’t make up your mind. The Sun and Venus are telling you to reach for the stars, but then stern Saturn pulls you back to Earth with a thud. Neptune is pushing you into anal-retentive land in which nothing is good enough, then Jupiter tells you to Zen out, be grateful and surround everything with a white light. It’s rainbows and unicorns versus the cold cruel light of dawn. Fear not. Once Monday rolls around, you’ll feel more in balance—and ready to be more adventurous!

"
8611,4 june 2017,libra,"The brakes are off! Megawatt Mars cruises into your ambition and success sector, its first visit here in over two years. Whether you’re looking for love, want to write the next best seller, run a marathon or crush it in the business world, the motivation will be there. With Mercury just about ready to enter your optimistic house of risk taking, you’ll be thinking bigger and bolder than usual. Carpe diem.

"
8612,5 june 2017,libra,"It’s one thing to know what you want, it’s another to figure out how to go about getting it. With the Sun in the loftiest sector of your chart, you should have no shortage of bright ideas. But murky Neptune is getting in the way of execution. This is not  the time to “wing it”. Nor is it wise to ignore details or the systems, resources and people that you may need in the near future. Pay attention to the nitty gritty and the big picture will take care of itself.

"
8613,6 june 2017,libra,"Vision quest, anyone? The planets are aligning in such a way that you may finally acquire a new philosophy about life that feeds your heart and your mind. If this means reading books about metaphysics, beginning a meditation practice or treating your body as if it’s a temple, so be it. The next few weeks may bring the utmost catharsis. Give yourself the time and the freedom to allow it to unfold.

"
8614,7 june 2017,libra,"A wonderful opportunity for expanding your mind is available to you, Libra! Mental Mercury has just entered the most philosophical part of your chart. Don’t be surprised if you start picking up books written by Thoreau or Emerson, or the Tao Te Ching. Maybe you’ll book a trip to an Indian reservation this summer to witness a bona fide powwow. Podcasts of interviews with the greatest thinkers of our time might also be on your list. This aspect runs through the 21st, but you may become a life-long learner.

"
8615,8 june 2017,libra,"Curb your enthusiasm! There are only 24 hours in a day, Libra, something that you may have been forgetting lately. Deceptive Neptune may make you feel as though you have plenty of time to complete a particular task or goal, but in reality it may take longer than you think. Adding to this is optimistic Jupiter, which could be making you feel like Superman or woman. Not! The full moon on Friday will bring clarity and the chance to strategize better.

"
8616,9 june 2017,libra,"You’re in the spotlight today Libra, as a full moon in your house of self-expression allows you to dazzle others with your smarts. Something that you’ve been working on may come to a happy conclusion: your college application or term paper, a marketing campaign, the manuscript you’ve been toiling on for years, or a pitch that you made awhile back to a decision maker. Someone may even express the desire to join with you in a formal business partnership or act as your agent. With red hot Mars known your career house, things can take off quickly.

"
8617,10 june 2017,libra,"You may have been in a reflective state over the past few months, Libra, courtesy of Jupiter being retrograde in your sign. Perhaps your self confidence was a bit low, or confusion reigned over which direct to head in. Thank goodness that’s over now as the gas giant resumes direct motion. Between now and October 10th you should dive in to as many new projects as possible, keeping your mind open to possibilities that you may not have considered before.

"
8618,11 june 2017,libra,"Unexpected events may occur this week, but these are good ones! From your chart it appears that your friends or a lover are the source of the action, so make plans with them. You’re up for some new experiences anyway.

"
8619,12 june 2017,libra,"Yowza! Your spirits soar as inspiration and optimism pour from the heavens into that head of yours. A superb Mercury-Jupiter trine allows you to think about things in ways you had never considered before. Just don’t get too carried away and wander into fantasy land.

"
8620,13 june 2017,libra,"Details may seem a bit fuzzy, as if you need more information before you proceed with something. Murky Neptune is spinning its fog, so progress could be slow until you ferret out what you need to know. Don’t rely on other people to provide you with the scoop as they may be confused themselves. Try to get to the bottom of things before Friday.
 

"
8621,14 june 2017,libra,"If you need to hold a conversation with a lover or a child about something significant, do so today. The emotional Moon will help you get your point across with clarity and logic; no drama needed! Tomorrow’s another story, however, when the Sun opposes Saturn. Your loved ones might not be amenable to your opinions, so strike while the iron is hot.

"
8622,15 june 2017,libra,"Optimism should be running high, Libra, thanks to the Sun sailing through one of the most free spirited parts of your chart. The problem is that someone in your circle may be in “Grinch mode”, ready to burst your bubble with a snide remark or sending you the stink eye. This aspect reoccurs on Sunday, but don’t let a troll bother you. Once the Sun enters Cancer next Wednesday you’ll become even more determined to enjoy the good things in life.

"
8623,16 june 2017,libra,"Your sign is known for being willing to work as a team member, but over the next five months you may feel like no one else is. That’s because murky Neptune retrogrades in your house of efficiency, which not only refers to your own productivity but that of the people around you. Get ready for unreliable kids, family members and co-workers. Since you can only control your own level of efficiency, identify the areas of your own life that could use smarter habits and routines.

"
8624,17 june 2017,libra,"Not thrilled with your physique or state of health? Then get past the notion that you’re destined to live with the body you currently have. Now that cleansing Neptune is retrograde in your health and vitality sector you have the opportunity to address your weight issues. Chronic aches and pains can also be 86’d, so start finding solutions.

"
8625,18 june 2017,libra,"Adventure is calling your name, Libra. It’s time to get out of Dodge and head off into the wild blue yonder. All those things on your bucket list that you say you’re going to do someday? Someday is here and now.

"
8626,19 june 2017,libra,"Sometimes ideas are ahead of their time, and that’s the case with yours today, Libra. People may not be able to see the wisdom (hell, the brilliance) in what you’re putting forth. Just wait a day or two. When the Sun enters Cancer on Wednesday they’ll be more inclined to listen.

"
8627,20 june 2017,libra,"With the Sun moving into the most ambitious part of your chart tomorrow, you may already be thinking about your next big move. You might want to consider teaming up with someone else in order to develop momentum and reach your goals. A productive Mercury-Uranus aspect today suggests finding a like-minded person to work with, or even an expert who can provide you with savvy advice. Two heads are better than one.

"
8628,22 june 2017,libra,"Now that the Sun and Mercury have joined energetic Mars in your ambition sector, you should be more than ready to get moving with important goals. However, Neptune just went retrograde in your detail-oriented sixth house, perhaps creating confusion about the best strategy and systems to use. Work this out before you plunge ahead.

"
8629,23 june 2017,libra,"With tomorrow’s new moon occurring in your house of ambition, you may be wondering if your plans are do-able. They are! The Moon, Mercury and Sun all hold a logical, thoughtful conversation today about which direction you should be heading in. You’re not in fantasy land: you’re in the right place to make things happen.

"
8630,24 june 2017,libra,"A brand new chapter can open up in your career as today’s new moon takes place in the most ambitious part of your chart. If you’ve been thinking about starting a home-based business, or want to telecommute from home, the aspects for doing so are excellent. But regardless as to where you do your thing, just don’t push yourself too hard too fast. You have the next six months to make strides.

"
8631,25 june 2017,libra,"Your success over the next six months will be shaped by more than mere motivation on your part. Sure, assertive Mars is currently helping you develop momentum as it cruises through your ambition sector. And there was a new moon in this house a few days ago. But you have to make sure that you have the right systems in place and the right kind of people by your side in order to take that victory lap.

"
8632,26 june 2017,libra,"It’s time to motivate the troops and get everyone together to work toward a common goal. You’re currently in a place where you can achieve a lot (thanks to so much planetary activity in your ambition sector) but you’ll need cooperation from others. You’ve got what it takes to motivate them, so put on your leader persona and make it happen.

"
8633,27 june 2017,libra,"You need to become more organized, and with constructive Neptune in your house of efficiency this should be a snap. Helping matters along is whip smart Mercury, which will help you prioritize and think things through logically.

"
8634,27 june 2016,libra,"Yee-ha! Planet of negotiation and commerce, Mercury, zips into your career sector—just as Mars goes direct in your income house! This is one heck of a day for advancement in your job or business, as inspirational Neptune is also on the job, helping bring in new clients, projects or job offers. It doesn’t get much better than this. The energy will last for several days, so use it to your advantage.

"
8635,28 june 2017,libra,"The next few weeks are your best time all year to make career progress, and today could mark a turning point. The planet of motivation, Mars, meets up with shrewd negotiator Mercury. This is one heck of a day to network, schedule a job interview, call a major prospect, put together a business plan or research a business idea. Don’t waste it!

"
8636,28 june 2016,libra,"You’ve been peeling back layers of your subconscious mind since last summer, when Jupiter entered your house of deep reflection. Today you may be questioning the status of a romantic or business partnership, especially your own needs for security. Planetary influences indicate that you may be feeling more independent and less concerned about the opinions of others.

"
8637,29 june 2017,libra,"An internal battle may be brewing as you consider new goals or possibilities. One little voice in your mind might be telling you to go for it, and yet another one says, “Yes, but…..”  Luckily for you, the voice that urges you to charge ahead will win this battle, while the worried one (that fears change and demands security at all costs) will be vanquished.

"
8638,29 june 2016,libra,"A domestic or family issue may be on your mind, and you could be struggling to figure out how to handle it. On a positive note, optimistic Jupiter is active in your house of intuition, providing you with the guidance you need to put matters on the right track.

"
8639,30 june 2017,libra,"You may feel as though you’re stuck in the middle of warring responsibilities: your work life on the one hand, and your personal and family life on the other. Fortunately, the Moon meets up with happy-go-lucky Jupiter today, helping you develop a more relaxed attitude about the whole thing. The weekend is here: be good to yourself.

"
8640,30 june 2016,libra,"Criticism from a boss or parent could come your way today, which could leave you with an unsettled feeling. Pluto is in your house of confidence and security, but today it opposes Venus. Pluto’s job is to help us reframe the way we view situations. Is there a way that you can look at this matter with a different viewpoint?

"
8641,1 july 2017,libra,"A diet, exercise or health protocol may need to be adjusted if you want to achieve optimal results, Libra. But this shouldn’t be a big issue, not with optimistic Jupiter involved. This vibe continues through mid-July so if you’re looking for good advice you will be able to find it.

"
8642,1 july 2016,libra,"Sometimes in business it’s smart just to go with logic and reason, and other times it’s wiser to go with your gut. Today the latter applies. Generous Jupiter has been stationed in your psychic twelfth house since last summer, and it’s actively sending your guidance and ideas as to where you should head with your ambitions. Pay attention!

"
8643,2 july 2017,libra,"Make sure that everyone around you has your back, Libra. With below-the-radar Pluto in a difficult spot today, people could be working their own agendas–but not in an obvious manner. The good news is that with the Sun and Mars in your authoritative tenth house, you can regain control of a situation, no matter what someone else has in mind.

"
8644,2 july 2016,libra,"Big changes are afoot with your career, Libra, so spend some time this weekend thinking about where you want to go on your path. The first two weeks of July are superb for strategizing and getting your name and reputation out there. Contacts that you make over the next few weeks could turn out to be quite significant, not just over the next few months, but over decades.

"
8645,3 july 2017,libra,"Being open and honest about your feelings today becomes easier with a sweet lunar aspect. If someone can’t take the truth, that says more about them than it does about you. Besides, with gentle Venus moving into Gemini on Tuesday you’re going to be living life on a bigger scale. Don’t let anyone hold you back.

"
8646,3 july 2016,libra,"Neptune has been active in your work sector, possibly befuddling your mind. Which direction to go in? How do I handle that cranky co-worker? What’s the best way to streamline my work flow? But the Sun forms a highly productive angle to Neptune today, lighting up the path ahead. It’s time to make your life easier.

"
8647,4 july 2017,libra,"An adventurous vibe is in the air as Venus and Mercury change signs this week, taking your life to a more sociable and optimistic place. Today Venus makes her move, entering your house of big picture thinking. Then on Wednesday chatty Mercury zips into your house of networking and friendships. What a marvelous time to bounce ideas off of people, form new alliances and party while you’re at it!

"
8648,4 july 2016,libra,"Ready to ink a deal, make a big presentation or kick off an exciting business venture? With today’s new moon in the most ambitious part of your chart, the next few months could open doors that may have seemed firmly shut in the past. Saturn is in a good angle from your house of negotiation and contracts, indicating that whatever you initiate will be well thought out and stand the test of time.

"
8649,5 july 2017,libra,"This is a day when teamwork will pay off, so don’t try to do everything on your own, or worse–be a renegade. Show your boss, family, co-workers or team that you’re willing to chip in and get things done. The upside? They’ll trust you in the future to be efficient, which means that they’ll be more likely to leave you alone.

"
8650,5 july 2016,libra,"Great day to impress the boss or a client! Neptune is stirring up your imagination, helping you come up with solutions to problems and fresh new ideas. Schedule interviews, presentations. Your hard work from the past is going to pay off soon.

"
8651,6 july 2017,libra,"Lucky Jupiter should  be buoying your enthusiasm. Problem is, not every one around you is looking at the bright side. As a matter of fact they may be downright cantankerous. But why should this ruin your day, or the “flow of your chi”  as they say in the East? You have the right to be happy, so take good care of yourself and honor this.

"
8652,6 july 2016,libra,"Libra, you are the darling of the zodiac when it comes to career advancement, and today is a banner day. With a Mars-Venus trine and the authoritative Sun shaking hands with negotiation whiz Mercury, you couldn’t ask for a better day to let the world know about your talents. Make presentations, pitch your ideas, and schedule interviews. Between now and the 22nd is your time to shine.

"
8653,7 july 2017,libra,"You may have been dealing with self doubts over the past few days (or weeks!), but a positive Mercury aspect helps put them in perspective. And considering that Venus is now in your mind-expanding ninth house of possibilities, it’s all systems go.

"
8654,7 july 2016,libra,"Something is going to happen today with your career that will make you question what’s going on. You’re in a highly ambitious phase, thanks to hosting beneficial planets in your house of ambition. But shadowy Pluto is acting up, bringing up issues about job security or the strength of a business partnership. This little storm will pass quickly, and by tomorrow you’ll have more insight.

"
8655,8 july 2017,libra,"Your focus will shift away from work responsibilities to more personal matters, due to tonight’s full moon in Capricorn. If you haven’t been spending enough time with loved ones (or enjoying personal down time), the grind may be getting to you. This is also an excellent time to make long range plans: looking for a new place to live, starting a family, committing to a lover or helping your parents with estate planning.

"
8656,8 july 2016,libra,"Some of the greatest scientific discoveries and inventions of all time have been discovered by people who had an odd dream or a funny hunch. What put these folks in the history books is that they act on their intuitive hits. And your  intuition should be off the charts today, thanks to lucky Jupiter stirring up your subconscious mind. You have the opportunity to advance your career and ambitions in quite a powerful way!

"
8657,9 july 2017,libra,"You may be questioning some of your biggest dreams and plans as the Moon glides through one of the most emotional part of your chart. But don’t make any snap decisions, as this energy will continue over the next two weeks. One of the smartest things you can do right now is to find a mentor or mastermind group, something that can really take off after the 20th.

"
8658,9 july 2016,libra,"Our thoughts create our emotions, which lead to our actions, thus in turn affecting our reality. A meet up between the impassioned Moon and advantageous Jupiter allows you to work through thought patterns that may be holding you back. With logical Saturn in your intelligence sector, you’ll be able to make sense of things–and then make progress.

"
8659,10 july 2017,libra,"Boundaries, people! You may need to set them with your closest connections as a Sun-Pluto smackdown creates tension. If folks are butting in with unwanted opinions, or they’re trying to get their own way, it’s time to let them know under no uncertain terms that you have a mind–and a life–of your own.

"
8660,10 july 2016,libra,"People in positions of authority will be more willing than usual to hear what you have to say, Libra. This is not the time to sit back and hope that your “luck turns” or that the cavalry is going to ride in and save you. Stick your neck out and let power brokers know that you’ve got talent.

"
8661,11 july 2017,libra,"You may be in the mood to pamper yourself, thanks to the luscious Moon gliding through your fifth house of the luxe life. And why not? The Sun and Mars have been charging through your ambition sector, pushing you to achieve. What’s the point of working hard if you can’t reward yourself now and then?

"
8662,11 july 2016,libra,"Career matters could hit a snag as someone in your circle throws a monkey wrench into the works. It could be a colleague, manager or even a spouse who isn’t in agreement with the way you think that things should be done. While talkative Mercury is in your house of authority, sharpening your intellect, others may not see the value in your ideas. When Venus changes signs tomorrow, there should be a shift toward more teamwork.

"
8663,12 july 2017,libra,"Being able to see both sides of an argument or situation is the specialty of your sign, and today your vision will be even more crystal clear. You’ll be able to use this energy to figure out the next smart step for your life, so take an objective view of the path ahead.

"
8664,12 july 2016,libra,"It’s time to take your day dreams (and dare I say fantasies!) and turn them into reality. Lucky Venus enters Leo, your eleventh house of hopes and wishes. Whereas going after your passions often can feel like an uphill battle, Venus’s job is to make things flow more smoothly. This doesn’t mean that you won’t have to expend effort, but that doors should open more easily and there should be fewer roadblocks in your path. Chances are that you won’t be traveling down this road by yourself. Teamwork, friends, and networking are all highlighted in the weeks ahead.

"
8665,13 july 2017,libra,"Inspiration strikes today. Or is the cosmos giving you a good swift kick in the butt? That’s because Neptune and the Moon meet up in your fitness sector, pushing you off the couch and onto the jogging path. Or the elliptical machine. Or the pool. There’s no need to join an expensive gym: with the recent full moon in your domestic sector, at-home workouts (or the “head out the front door” type) are the best way to go.

"
8666,13 july 2016,libra,"Sometimes the planets tell you that flying solo is the way to go, but that’s not the case for you right now, Libra. Mercury’s entry into your friendly eleventh house of networking means that the time is ripe for meeting as many new faces as you can. Regardless as to whether you’re a stay at home mom, a CEO or a budding artist, the connections you make over the next five weeks could bring both enjoyment and advancement into your life. When people come together for a common purpose, great things can happen.

"
8667,14 july 2017,libra,"It pays these days to make a good impression on others, Libra–even if you don’t feel like it! Fortunately you should  be open to networking and being diplomatic, thanks to a positive Mercury-Jupiter aspect. You have the goods…now it’s time to show them off.

"
8668,14 july 2016,libra,"A frank exchange is necessary when it comes to your serious relationships, be they personal or business. Planetary influences suggest that you’re looking for more security, but pushing too hard for it may work against you. Slow down, soften your words, be remain honest and open for maximum results.

"
8669,15 july 2017,libra,"If you want to move up in the world, you’ll need to impress decision makers and other muckety mucks. A stellar Moon-Mars aspect will help you come up with a plan to do so. Hint: showing how efficient and organized you are is the way to go.

"
8670,15 july 2016,libra,"Got something on your mind? Then get it out! Whether it’s an opinion or concern that you need to share with someone close, a brainstorm for a new business, or some brilliant new thoughts for your thesis, let them flow. Write, blog, discuss, draw, or videotape. A superb Moon-Saturn meeting in your intelligent third house of expression suggests that your actions will have positive long-term effects.

"
8671,16 july 2017,libra,"Don’t tread on me! While you’re willing to be a team player, you’re not  willing to be pushed around by someone. And anyone who gets bossy with you will find that out the hard way. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself.

"
8672,16 july 2016,libra,"Your career is in the planet’s spotlight these days, and a terrific Mars-Sun trine indicates that more money could be coming your way. But it’s more than just cold, hard cash–a long-held dream of yours may be within your grasp. You’ve worked hard to get where you are and now it’s payback time.

"
8673,17 july 2017,libra,"Power plays dominate the office today, so get ready for some intense drama! This energy will be at play over the next week, so patience will definitely be a virtue. This is not a good time to make big decisions, piss off decision makers or lose it with a colleague. Keep calm and carry on.

"
8674,17 july 2016,libra,"Just what do you need to feel secure? A million dollars in the bank? A lover who’s true? A week without any drama whatsoever? We all have different standards when it comes to this topic, so consider what “security” means to you. As the Moon enters this part of your chart you’ll become more reflective, and by the time of Tuesday’s full moon you may make some big decisions that will add to your feeling of surety.

"
8675,18 july 2017,libra,"Don’t be surprised if people start to look at you in a different way. Sometimes it takes lesser mortals awhile to catch up to someone who has a unique vision, a happier attitude or the desire to live life on bolder terms. You’ve got the goods and others are starting to notice.

"
8676,18 july 2016,libra,"Your happiness at home is the focus of the planets these days, whether you live alone or with a big family. Today’s Pluto-Moon connection is encouraging you to identify what’s broken and needs to be fixed, and I’m not referring to the plumbing! Is there ease, balance, beauty and serenity at home and in your family? If not, you need to start addressing the problem people and the dramas they’re causing.

"
8677,19 july 2017,libra,"Long term commitments of all kinds are favored, whether you’re planning to go to graduate school, get married or enter into an entrepreneurial venture with some partners. Today is super for discussions and strategizing.

"
8678,19 july 2016,libra,"The full moon in Capricorn is a winner for making progress on the home front. Whether you’re considering buying, selling, renting or decorating, it’s time to make a decision. The same holds true for finally  closing out domestic dramas that are well past their sell-by date. Your SO may not be on board with your plans right away due to a tense angle from Uranus. Revisit things with your amour on the 27th for better results.

"
8679,20 july 2017,libra,"Team time! Assertive Mars enters Leo, your eleventh house of collaborations and camaraderie. Consider networking at industry events to find a new job. Let a friend play matchmaker. Put your heart and time into a worthy cause by joining a charitable organization.

"
8680,20 july 2016,libra,"Who out there wants more love in their life? Funny, I don’t hear a single Libra, single or attached, saying “Not me!”  And that’s a good thing, because a glorious Saturn-Venus trine is working double overtime to bring more amour your way. Singles, your best bet under current planetary influences is to join a group, network, go online or have a friend introduce you to a new flame. Committed Libras need to open the lines of communication with their partner and create more of a team environment.

"
8681,21 july 2017,libra,"Despite the fact that Mars entered your teamwork sector yesterday, don’t expect people to be cooperative today. A Sun-Uranus square will bring out the egos as folks vie for position and power. Over the next four weeks you should think about who needs to remain on Team Libra–and who has to go.

"
8682,21 july 2016,libra,"Benevolent Jupiter has been stationed in your house of the subconscious mind for close to a year now, aiming to soothe your tired mind and bring you more serenity. Today the cosmos asks you to reconsider your attitudes, fears, values and concerns about love. Be honest and look for areas where you may be tripping yourself up–then release old patterns.

"
8683,22 july 2017,libra,"Sun in Leo highlights key collaborations over the next four weeks. Join forces with others for a good cause and be the change the world needs to see. Rub elbows with movers and shakers in your industry. Call the tribe and plan a major party. This is no time to hide out at home!

"
8684,22 july 2016,libra,"Get ready for some serious mingling, Libra! The Sun has entered Leo, your eleventh house of networking and camaraderie. The next four weeks are super for joining a think tank, attending industry events, meeting a new romantic partner through a singles group, or making changes in your town via a neighborhood association. It’s also a wonderful time to lend a hand to a charity or good cause.

"
8685,23 july 2017,libra,"Rebellious streak? Or is it a taste of independence you’re after? Today’s new moon falls in your house of friends and camaraderie, which bodes well for socializing and meeting people. But Uranus is in a harsh spot, indicating that someone close may not share your desire to schmooze and mingle. Maybe you need a little space.

"
8686,23 july 2016,libra,"Neptune has been backstroking through your house of work for awhile now, possibly creating confusion at your end. But retrograde periods serve a purpose. They help us reflect upon what’s working and what’s not in our lives. You could be questioning whether you’re in the right line of work, or if your current employer is the best fit for you. Doubts about clients, colleagues and protocols could be running through your mind. A Moon-Neptune connection today could find you ruminating about these topics. When Mercury goes retro on the 30th, you’ll be able to figure out your next move.

"
8687,24 july 2017,libra,"Telling it like it is is crucial over the next few days–the question is, are others being as open as you are? Don’t read too much into what others are saying; let them reveal what they’re really thinking and planning to do next.

"
8688,24 july 2016,libra,"Now that the Sun is in the house of your deepest wishes, chances are your thoughts are turning to romance. If that’s the case, you’re in luck. A happy Moon-Sun trine helps you focus on your desires, perhaps even to manifest them! It’s not enough to dream–take some action.

"
8689,25 july 2017,libra,"Start becoming more selective about the people you associate with. Seek advice and friendship from mentors and pals who know you best and have your interests at heart. You don’t need a lot of “likes” in your personal life! In this Facebook world, many people feel the need to accumulate contacts. Quality over quantity, my friend.

"
8690,25 july 2016,libra,"Your sign is known for being the best at handling committed partnerships, but with Uranus going retrograde on Friday in this part of the sky you might be thinking twice about romance. For the past week planetary aspects have been asking you just how content and secure you feel in your relationship. Singles may be considering what kind of guarantees they need from a prospective lover. Today’s Moon-Pluto square will stir up these thoughts; pay attention.

"
8691,26 july 2017,libra,"A sizzling Mars-Sun aspect is perfect for creating a powerful team, or taking one that you’re already in to a higher level. You may need to be at the helm, or at the least provide the group with some direction. In addition, any kind of tech venture initiated within the next 48 hours can pay off handsomely–and that includes online dating!

"
8692,26 july 2016,libra,"With the passionate Moon in the most emotional part of your chart, feelings may arise that perhaps you had forgotten about long ago. La Luna makes a superb angle to transformational Pluto, helping you release the past for a far better tomorrow. A deeper sense of contentment will result.

"
8693,27 july 2017,libra,"Hello, Moon! La Luna is doing you the honor of entering your sign for the next few days, so soak up its passionate energy. This is an excellent time for you to be out mingling with others– start texting your BFFs and make plans. You never know just who they might introduce you to.

"
8694,27 july 2016,libra,"Don’t be surprised if people are clamoring to be on Team Libra these days! You have something going for you that others find attractive, whether it’s charisma, business sense or some terrific ideas. But with Uranus heading retrograde on Friday in your partnership sector, be careful of the bonds you forge. Stick with the best.

"
8695,28 july 2017,libra,"Don’t be surprised if you feel that you’re looking out for your own best interests these days–the Moon is now in your sign, and it’s high-fiving abundant Jupiter. Don’t worry, you won’t be selfish about this. The key is to surround yourself with people who share the same values, and if you do that, naturally there will be less friction.

"
8696,28 july 2016,libra,"Current planetary influences indicate that you’re anxious for more security in all areas of your life. So why do you feel so restless? The Taurus moon is stirring up thoughts of indulging yourself and perhaps throwing a little caution to the wind. No problem there. Cut loose and enjoy the day without the incessant thoughts of where you’re going next.

"
8697,29 july 2017,libra,"Close relationships might be all over the place this weekend as conflicting aspects arise. Today is not a good time for spontaneous activities or talks. Stick to the tried and true today and don’t rock the boat.

"
8698,29 july 2016,libra,"“Where is this relationship heading?” That famous line will be in abundance among Libras now that erratic Uranus has gone retrograde in your commitment sector. Uranus loves to look at the future, and if you can’t see a future with your amour, it may be time to move on. But happily involved Libras will enjoy this period, as it encourages you to spend more face time (and less tech time) with your partner. This is the planet of digital toys, so put ’em away.

"
8699,30 july 2017,libra,"A playful mood is in the air with charismatic Venus winking at spontaneous Uranus is the heavens. Therefore, the cosmos authorizes you to flirt, party, go to the beach or have fun with your honey. No honey in sight? Then start looking, because Uranus is in your house of commitment.

"
8700,30 july 2016,libra,"One of the biggest issues with trusting that your intuition is on target is just that: trust, or faith. Get ready for a highly intuitive time ahead now that intelligent Mercury is in the house of the subconscious mind. Mercury is pragmatic and keeps things real, so if your gut is telling you something, chances are good that it’s right on target. Incisive Mercury will also help you get to the root of fears, worries and other negative thought patterns. Release and move on.

"
8701,31 july 2017,libra,"Got #goals? Then you’re in luck as planet of ease, Venus, glides into your ambition sector. Whether you’re trying to land a new lover or a job, lose weight or gain new friends, the next three weeks are perfect for achieving this–without a lot of sweat.

"
8702,31 july 2016,libra,"Hmmm, someone’s feeling their oats! Libra is known for being the sign of cooperation, but there’s a difference between working with others and relinquishing control. Taking over the reins may be in your best interest today. Let others know what expectations you have of them, and if you need to lay down a new protocol, so be it.

"
8703,1 august 2017,libra,"Hold out for the best, whether it’s in your career or love. Take your time and consider what’s currently on offer. You may be able to do better, and next week’s eclipse in the most creative part of your chart could point out new options that you’ve never considered–or been exposed to.

"
8704,1 august 2016,libra,"Power to the tribe! Your friends are going to be a much bigger part of your life in the weeks to come, and today, two happy trines involve your closest acquaintances. A pal could introduce you to a new amour, ask you to join a club or industry group, or just invite you out for a good time. There’s a lucky vibe surrounding this, by the way! You never know what may come out of a chance encounter.

"
8705,2 august 2017,libra,"Say what you mean and mean what you say! There’s no room for ambiguity today in any area of your life. You don’t have to beat anyone over the head, though–just be authoritative in a calm manner. You’ll get your point across.

"
8706,2 august 2016,libra,"Go tell it from the mountain! What a day to speak your mind or engage in some shameless self-promotion. First, self-confident Mars barrels into your house of communication for a nice long stay. It is accompanied by a new moon in the house of networking, technology, making new contacts and big plans. Got a message to get across–to your kids, a lover, friends or the entire world? Don’t hold back!

"
8707,3 august 2017,libra,"Partnerships of all kinds will experience erratic patterns now that Uranus has gone retrograde in the sector that governs them. Speeding up, slowing down—partners flaking out—rules and roles needing to be altered. This energy will be in play until the first week of January, so patience will definitely be needed.

"
8708,3 august 2016,libra,"While the planets are creating a more convivial atmosphere for you, encouraging you to mingle and socialize, you still need to keep your radar turned on. Not everyone is as open as you, nor do they have the same mindset, values and ethics. Have fun but don’t give away too much information to others until you feel that you really know them.

"
8709,4 august 2016,libra,"With candid Mars turning up the heat in your talkative third house, you may feel like reaching out to everyone in your circle and enjoying a nice long chat. But planetary influences suggest that you hold some information back. Being friendly doesn’t mean that you have to divulge all of your thoughts, plans and secrets.

"
8710,5 august 2017,libra,"We all have to work with other people, whether it’s at the office, within our family or a volunteer organization we’re a part of. From your chart it appears that some new life needs to be breathed into a team effort, not to mention rearranging roles and routines. Fortunately your creativity is running high, so seize the reins and make it happen.

"
8711,5 august 2016,libra,"A dynamic behind-the-scenes trine between the Moon and Pluto is bolstering your determination to take more control. You want more power over your thoughts and emotions, which will help you handle your personal relationships in a more powerful way. Pluto is on a mission to put you in the driver’s seat.

"
8712,6 august 2017,libra,"With the Moon in your house of contentment, you’re in no mood for surprises from people close to you. But that’s not going to stop them from acting up, so just roll with it. The mood shifts big time with tomorrow’s lunar eclipse, which will open up a far more enjoyable time for you.

"
8713,6 august 2016,libra,"Just because a thought enters your mind, or an opinion, doesn’t mean that you should verbalize it. Tense angles between planets in your house of confidentiality and some in your chatty third house suggest that discretion is the greatest part of valor this weekend.

"
8714,7 august 2017,libra,"La Luna lights up your love life with a sparking full moon eclipse in the romance sector. The next six months are highly auspicious for meeting someone new, conceiving a baby, getting engaged or deepening a bond. Attention single people (or those who are attached but looking anyway): your friends are the best source of introduction, along with networking at social events.

"
8715,7 august 2016,libra,"You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink. Today’s Mercury-Neptune opposition suggests that no matter how concise an argument or case you present to someone, that they’re simply not going to get it. Whether it’s a friend, lover, family member or business contact, you’re going to feel like you’re talking to a wall. The issue at hand is that your intuition is sharp as a tack, along with your ability to reason. If others can’t see that, oh well…you tried to help.

"
8716,8 august 2017,libra,"Creativity rises today, and that’s a good thing as it appears that more effort needs to be put into a work project or personal relationship before it can be deemed a success. Fortunately you’re in the mood to cooperate and people will sense it. Your like the lit candle, surrounded by moths–they can’t help but get pulled in by your light.

"
8717,8 august 2016,libra,"It appears that you’ve been waffling back and forth on an issue that needs to be worked on; specifically, the exact process that needs to be followed in order to make things work. It doesn’t matter if it’s your diet, the redecorating project, patching up your romance or how to connect with a particular client. Today’s aspects ask you to think about how or why things haven’t been successful in the past and then change them. If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get the same tired old results.

"
8718,9 august 2017,libra,"Getting clear about big dreams and values is paramount right now, due to both the Sun and Mars in the sector where we focus on the “big stuff”. Today is a smart time to consider what you want and where you’re heading with family and residential matters: moving, having a baby, telling nosy relatives to butt out of your business, or redecorating. Your sense of contentment is what it’s all about.

"
8719,9 august 2016,libra,"With Venus and Mercury in the most secluded and thoughtful part of your chart, you may be quietly ruminating over your next move. The problem is that Mars is pushing you to take action. A productive Moon-Venus angle helps you create a plan, so grab a pen and some paper and spell it out, step by step.

"
8720,10 august 2017,libra,"Despite the urge to strike out on your own, you would be wise to play nice and be a team member over the next few days. In fact, you may need to keep a close eye on people around you, and this will give you the chance to do so.

"
8721,10 august 2016,libra,"Your relationships with others are the focus of the cosmos this week, especially family members or someone you live with. Your intuition is operating at a very high level, providing you with insight as to how to deal with them and what may be going on behind the scenes. On a positive note, this insight will be able to help you resolve matters to your liking. It’s possible that you share different ideas, values, habits or routines, but under current planetary influences a resolution is probable.

"
8722,11 august 2017,libra,"Abundant Jupiter is in one heck of a good mood today, and this planet wants to bring more people into your world–the fun, interesting, helpful kind. It’s the weekend–get out there and meet as many new faces as you can. You never know where a connection might lead!

"
8723,11 august 2016,libra,"With the intuitive Moon orbiting past Mars and Saturn today in your communications sector, your ability to perceive information–whether it’s coming from this plane or the spirit realm–will increase dramatically. Chances are you’ve been second guessing yourself lately, but now you’re being given a valuable gift: clarity. Use it to your advantage.

"
8724,12 august 2017,libra,"Tread warily over the next few weeks as Mercury retrogrades in one of the most hidden parts of your chart. The good news is that your intuition will be high, pointing out people and situations that don’t seem right. The bad news is that your logical mind may reject what your gut is telling you. If in doubt, don’t rush to judgment.

"
8725,12 august 2016,libra,"A surprising revelation could come your way about a partner, be they romantic or business. Jupiter in the house of the subconscious mind is ramping up your intuition, so this “news flash” will most likely be a realization that you  make, not a statement from the other party. The energy is positive, however, as it will allow you to readjust how you relate to and work with this individual.

"
8726,13 august 2017,libra,"A major league solar eclipse is arriving next week in your networking sector, and some important new people could be soon entering your life. Today an auspicious Sun-Saturn trine could get this party started. If you’ve been trying to gain entry into a particular group or industry, or you’ve been looking for the right mentor, start reaching out to others right now.

"
8727,13 august 2016,libra,"It’s time to consider what other people have to say, although no one is accusing you of being closed-minded! The reason is that Saturn goes direct in your thinking and communication sector after a five-month retrograde period. You may have withdrawn somewhat as you reconsidered plans and the way you relate to the people in your circle. A fresh new perspective may be just what’s needed in order to work well with others.

"
8728,14 august 2017,libra,"Following your passion or bliss is always recommended by self-help gurus, but can it really be done? That question will be on your mind over the following week as your major goals and desires enter center stage. Next week’s eclipse may shake up preconceived notions, so start considering what you really want today.

"
8729,14 august 2016,libra,"Although Saturn just went direct yesterday in your communication sector, you may be holding back from talking today and relying on your intuition instead. Over the next few days it would be wise to do so, as Venus is active in the vibey, metaphysical twelfth house. People around you, especially at work, may not be easy to read if you just try to use logic alone. You’ve got a secret weapon: use it!

"
8730,15 august 2017,libra,"From your chart it’s obvious that you want peace and contentment. Problem is, people around you may not be coming from the same place. You can fight them if you choose, but you’ll end up stirring up way too much drama–which completely goes against what you desire. Let them be.

"
8731,15 august 2016,libra,"This could be an emotional day as the passionate Moon swings past powerful Pluto. Past memories from your childhood could come to the fore, especially if there are unresolved issues. Carrying baggage that was dumped on you by parents or other family members doesn’t help you on your journey. Fortunately, intelligent Mercury in the house of the subconscious mind is in a place to help you reason things out.

"
8732,16 august 2017,libra,"If you need people to back a particular idea or plan of yours, the smart way to go about it is to focus on the big picture, the end result. Yes, a big plan is made up of many small actions, but if you talk about the details you’ll lose your audience!

"
8733,16 august 2016,libra,"Got romance on your mind? This Thursday’s full moon falls in your house of amour, so whether you’re attached or single you’ll be affected. Things could start getting interesting today, though, as a positive trine occurs between the Sun and Uranus. Singles could be introduced to someone new at a social event via an introduction. And is that platonic friend of yours really “just a friend”? Attached Libras will be considering the next important step, such as pregnancy, getting married…or moving on to greener pastures.

"
8734,17 august 2017,libra,"Abundant, sunny Jupiter has been in your sign for almost a year now, opening your mind to a host of new possibilities. Goals that seemed impossible in the past may now be on your list of things to accomplish. But a Jupiter-Venus square today might make you feel tied down, as though you need to stick to a tired old script. Nope! Toss it.

"
8735,17 august 2016,libra,"People around you may be more open to having meaningful discussions today, especially in your personal life. And it’s about time! Planet of ease Venus is in the house of your emotions and psyche, smoothing the way for you to communicate with serenity. Be willing to hear the opinion of someone else while explaining your own. Progress can be made.

"
8736,18 august 2017,libra,"Confidence is sexy, and you should be looking like the most self-assured person in town. Magnetic Venus meets up with the amorous Moon today, giving you an allure that you’re gonna wish you could bottle and sell for profit. Since you can’t do that, you can at least turn some heads…and make people say, “Who is that mystery person?”

"
8737,18 august 2016,libra,"Be still, my beating heart! Yup, expect your pulse to quicken with today’s full moon in your love sector. A new hottie could show up on the scene or an existing romance could start to pick up steam. But we’re not talking about one night stands here. A happy meeting between the Sun and Uranus in your commitment sector indicates that this is the real deal. The only warning with this lunation is to think twice about an office romance.

"
8738,19 august 2017,libra,"Someone may challenge your authority today, and your response may be an emotional one. The Moon is in Cancer, making everyone a bit sensitive. But once it moves into Leo tomorrow a greater sense of teamwork appears for your sign. wait until then to work things out.

"
8739,19 august 2016,libra,"You may feel cornered by an endless list of errands and chores that need to be done at home or the office with tense aspects in the sky. You run the risk of snapping at someone (blame megamouth Mars in your communication sector), so take a deep breath and count to ten before you vent. By the way, the planets indicate that it’s time for your colleagues to pick up more of the slack. Stop being the office go-to gal or guy.

"
8740,20 august 2016,libra,"Feeling more intuitive than John Edward or the Long Island Medium? You should be! With Jupiter, Mercury and Venus in your vibey, metaphysical twelfth house your chakras should be wide open and your psychic ability off the charts. Just wait until the Sun joins them on Monday. Nobody better try to fool a Libra then. But the Moon today is making you doubt your gut feelings. Just roll with them and see what happens.

"
8741,21 august 2016,libra,"Slow down when it comes to going through you daily routine, chores or the grind at the office. While you may be anxious to blast through everything on your list and close deals, you run the risk of overlooking key details and making a mistake. The good news, however, is that your motivation for getting things done is increasing. But your work is  observed by others, and you don’t want to deliver shoddy results.

"
8742,22 august 2016,libra,"No sign has more going on in their brain than you, Libra! The Sun glides into Virgo today, the house of the subconscious mind. Perceptive Mercury and healing Jupiter are already there, along with serene Venus. The next few weeks are excellent for coming to grips with old issues, hurts, fears and habits that no longer serve a useful purpose. With a happy conjunction between Mercury and Jupiter, you may have an “aha!”moment in which you realize that you are bigger than your problems.

"
8743,24 august 2016,libra,"A playful aspect between the Moon and Neptune suggests that today’s a good day to call in sick…have a liquid lunch…plan cocktails with the tribe after work (if calling in sick just isn’t going to fly)…or plan a special day in the not-too-distant future for letting your hair down. Hey, it’s 5:00 somewhere.

"
8744,25 august 2016,libra,"Yesterday’s Mars-Saturn conjunction was all about letting you find your voice. The people in your world need to know what’s on your mind and where you stand. But be careful today of coming off as being too preachy or opinionated. Others may need time to get used to your candor and smart ideas.

"
8745,26 august 2016,libra,"Be meticulous in word and deed today, as a Mars-Neptune square could bring about hurried, unprofessional results–on your part or the part of others. Mars is tearing through your chatty third house of the written and spoken word. Double-check contracts and written assignments and watch what you post on social media. And keep the BS meter powered on too, as someone could be trying to baffle you with it.

"
8746,28 august 2016,libra,"Out with the old, in with the new. No, it’s not New Year’s Eve. It’s just that lovely Venus is getting ready to enter Libra on Monday, ushering in a happy phase in which you can doll yourself up and enjoy life more. But today’s cosmic energy tells you to take out some of the mental “toxic trash” that’s been building up first. You may realize that in order to live a happier life that you’ll need to take more control of certain situations.

"
8747,29 august 2016,libra,"You may have pulled into a little cocoon over the past few weeks, thanks to five celestial orbs taking up residence in your house of rest and closure. And today you might reach a decision about something that’s important to you, even if it means cutting out certain people or circumstances from your life. No problem there! Lucky Venus glides into Libra today, blessing you with its easy-going attitude. The next month is going to be one heck of a game changer.

"
8748,30 august 2016,libra,"You have an odd mix of planetary aspects at play, Libra. Lovely Venus just sashayed into your sign, ramping up your charisma and sex appeal as well as opening up a very social time period. But Mercury retrogrades today in your reclusive house of healing, nurturing and closure. So while part of you may want to head out and meet friends for dinner, another part may want to stay at home and meditate. Or–watch TV with a jar of Nutella in one hand and a cocktail in the other. It’s your choice.

"
8749,31 august 2016,libra,"As tomorrow’s solar eclipse in the most cathartic part of your chart draws near, you may be thinking about the chapters of your life that need to be closed out. Mercury has just gone retrograde here, creating a little confusion  as to what to do next. But the next few weeks will find you stepping out of the shadows and into the light as Venus smooths the path ahead.

"
8750,1 september 2016,libra,"There’s an old saying: in order to set forth on a new voyage, you have to lose sight of the shore. Truer words were never spoken, Libra, as a solar eclipse occurs today in the house of closure and moving on. You’re in a transition phase and the job of the eclipse is to point out the parts of your life that are no longer worth holding on to. This could mean habits, thought patterns, people or circumstances. When generous Jupiter enters your sign next week, a whole new chapter begins.

"
8751,2 september 2016,libra,"There’s a highly cathartic vibe in the air as Mercury and Jupiter hold a meeting in the psychological sector of your chart. Intelligent Mercury helps you get in touch with past hurts and negative emotions as healing Jupiter cleanses your tired mind and soul. You may feel conflicted as to whether or not you should voice your feelings to those around you. If that’s the case, wait until next Wednesday, a much better time to vent.

"
8752,3 september 2016,libra,"It could be a moody day, but you might be in the mood for love! La Luna swings past two of the most benevolent planets in our solar system, Jupiter and Venus, in your hush-hush twelfth house. Got a secret crush? Want to canoodle at home with the lights down low? Singles might be deep in thought about the kind of lover they want in their life. Next!

"
8753,4 september 2016,libra,"Trying to put a square peg into a round hole? it’s an exercise in frustration, my friend! Today you need to take a look at situations in your life that simply aren’t flowing as easily as they should. With the Moon in a difficult angle to Pluto, change isn’t going to happen overnight. The faster you realize that the happier you’ll be. With energetic Mars in a buoyant mood in your social third house, you’re better off heading out to brunch with a friend and letting your troubles alone for the day.

"
8754,5 september 2016,libra,"As the Moon swings through your sign today you’ll become more in tune with what is important to you. Setting priorities and fleshing out your passion projects is key this week.  Fortuitous Jupiter is scheduled to enter Libra this Friday for the first time in almost 13 years; give a lot of thought as to what you’d like to manifest in the year ahead.

"
8755,6 september 2016,libra,"Finding more creative ways to get your work done faster should be a snap today with some helpful angles between the Moon, Neptune and Saturn. Sometimes we need to take a step back from the usual way we get things done and take a new approach. Old habits die hard, but with wise and disciplined Saturn on the case, efficient new patterns can be put into place–and then cemented.

"
8756,7 september 2016,libra,"An emotional breakthrough can be reached today as four glorious celestial orbs help you dig deep into your subconscious and root out past problems that have troubled you. It’s time to axe these little suckers once and for all, and with a cathartic Venus-Saturn angle, communicating your thoughts is the best way to go. Whether you reach out to a trusted confidante or therapist, or just journal your emotions, the key is to release. Disciplined Saturn will provide you with the ability to stick with a happier new mindset.

"
8757,8 september 2016,libra,"The art of self-expression is not a gift that you inherit; it can be learned. Today’s Moon-Mars-Saturn powwow helps you nail down communication skills, whether it’s the way you talk to your kids, how you design a website or learn how to be a better teacher. These skills can last a lifetime with Saturn’s powerful influence.

"
8758,9 september 2016,libra,"Got a smug smile on your face? You should, Libra! As of today you are officially the celestial golden-haired girls and boys of the zodiac. That’s because lucky Jupiter just entered your sign where it will remain until October 11, 2017. Use Jupiter’s beneficial energy to go after just about anything your heart desires. Does this mean that it’s all going to be easy peasy? Of course not. But the initiatives you kick off today can change your life, with effects that will carry way into your future.

"
8759,10 september 2016,libra,"Cut the fluff and tell it like it is, Libra. No-nonsense Saturn in your communication sector warns you to be frank with others today, even if they don’t like it. There’s no need to be harsh or aggressive, however. Now that Jupiter is in the house of “you”, your needs and desires will be front and center. That may rub people the wrong way, but you can’t please everyone.

"
8760,11 september 2016,libra,"Family roles die hard, and if you have grown tired of the role you’ve been playing you may become keenly aware of it. Even past dramas from your childhood that have long been buried in your subconscious may bubble up to the surface of your mind, especially if someone else used to come down hard on you. It’s time to let it go. Now that Jupiter is in your sign, your needs are front and center.

"
8761,12 september 2016,libra,"A powerful meeting between the authoritative Sun and intelligent Mercury allows you to pinpoint the garbage in your life that simply must go!

"
8762,13 september 2016,libra,"In a reflective mood? You might be considering that Mercury is retrograde in your house of the mind, which includes the subconscious. A recent meeting between the Sun and Mercury was designed to shed some light on the past, the present and where you’re headed in the future, in all  areas of your life. This Friday’s lunar eclipse in Pisces could be the motivating force that kicks you into action on some new endeavors.

"

Today, a happy meeting between the Moon and maverick Uranus could suddenly inspire you to reach out to people around you and plan some social get togethers. With this Friday’s lunar eclipse taking place in your fitness sector, hooking up with a jogging partner or taking a class at the gym could be a great way to get in shape and make new friends.

"
8764,15 september 2016,libra,"Some unexpected news could come your way at work, as someone may be interested in partnering with you. Or perhaps it’s a new customer who has heard about your reputation and wants to talk about what you can do for them. But don’t wait for business to come to you. You should definitely be promoting yourself these days with Mars in the communication sector.

"
8766,18 september 2016,libra,"Just how much freedom do you need when it comes to the people around you? A Venus-Uranus opposition today may suddenly find you craving more alone time. This isn’t surprising considering that Jupiter just entered your sign not too long ago. And when the Sun enters Libra on Thursday, you may demand more independence.

"
8767,19 september 2016,libra,"What a wonderful week ahead for self-expression! Mars is making you  the person to listen to, so don’t hold back. Today magnetic Venus forms a glorious angle with Mars. Pitch an idea, schedule an interview, ask someone out on a date, hit the lecture circuit, sign up for Photoshop or Illustrator classes, or start writing a manuscript. You can’t go wrong.

"
8769,22 september 2016,libra,"Happy birthday Libra! The Sun enters your sign today, crowning you the celestial favorite for the next four weeks. This year will be different than those of the past, as lucky Jupiter happens to be in your house for the first time in over a decade. With the Moon in Taurus, you should be setting your sights higher than ever.

"
8770,23 september 2016,libra,"Lucky Jupiter is blessing your sign for the next year, but that doesn’t mean that every day will be rosy! Someone could be throwing their weight around today, such as your boss or lover. The Moon in Cancer might encourage you to respond with a crabby attitude (no pun intended), but let this little drama pass. A Sun-Jupiter conjunction on Monday in Libra puts you in control.

"
8771,24 september 2016,libra,"The cosmos is determined that you live a more contented lifestyle, and that often means getting rid of negative thought patterns. A happy and harmonious trine between Mercury and Pluto will allow you to do just that.  Got “daddy issues” from the past, or problems that have to do with authority figures? Work on those first.

"
8772,25 september 2016,libra,"Stellar day for making new friends, meeting a potential mate or developing business contacts! The Moon in Leo could bring in fortuitous connections that could make your life take a different turn. This is not  a day to stay locked up at home, unless you’re reaching out to fresh new acquaintances online.

"
8773,26 september 2016,libra,"Well, well, well, ain’t you somethin’ special. The Sun and lucky Jupiter are holding a powwow today in your sign, Libra! And they’ve decided to grant you a few wishes, kind of like Aladdin. However, the genie delivered the goods to our boy Alladin without him having to exert any effort. In your case, the cosmos has your back in a big way, but you’re going to have to put in some grunt work. That being said, today is one of the best days for your sign in over a decade for making your wishes come true.

"
8774,27 september 2016,libra,"With so much planetary activity taking place in your sign, you may be wondering where to start or what to focus on. You might want to take a look at domestic matters first, such as your residence or the dynamic between family members.

With powerful Pluto there also, the next seven weeks can be productive indeed.

A powerful Moon-Mercury meet-up could bring wisdom your way from the other realms, and it’s something that could put you in a good position. This kind of cosmic guidance doesn’t show up every day so use it to your advantage, with one caveat: don’t discuss your ideas with others, especially at the office.

"
8776,29 september 2016,libra,"A person close to you may act in an erratic manner today, and the best thing you can do is to quietly take things in without becoming too emotional. You have an advantage as the vibey Moon is in your house of intuition, enabling you to suss what’s going on with this individual. Another way this could play out is that you sense a shift with someone who’s acting like their usual self. If that’s the case, sniff out the truth.

Does this mean that goodies will be dropped into your lap? No, you’ll have to work for them. But you can make terrific headway in the months ahead.

"
8779,2 october 2016,libra,"Yesterday’s new moon in your sign is the perfect opportunity to kick off new initiatives, and what’s better still is that inspirational Neptune is in a terrific angle to help you.

"
8780,3 october 2016,libra,"You’ll be able to sell ice cream to Eskimos in the days ahead, thanks to a savvy angle between the Sun and Saturn. But make sure you think things through, as Saturn is determined to take whatever you set in motion and turn it into a long-term affair.

The Sun in Libra is trying to put you in the driver’s seat so that you can maintain some degree of control. Pluto, however, will be acting up later in the week, meaning that someone will be acting out, trying to manipulate matters or become downright dictatorial. Start maneuvering now!

"
8783,6 october 2016,libra,"Don’t kid yourself. That’s the message from the cosmos as Jupiter’s optimism may cloud your vision today and tomorrow. Whether it’s about love, your kids, the house, your ex—keep it real. Someone may be trying to push your buttons or push you to follow a certain course of action. Rely on rational thought more than emotion to make the right decisions.

"
8784,7 october 2016,libra,"If you enjoy being a doormat, then you’re gonna love the tense Sun-Pluto square today. Someone may be critical or dismissive of your feelings. A family member especially could act out, sticking their nose in your private business. But since most of you aren’t willing to be run over by anyone, here’s the good news: intelligent, quick thinking Mercury enters Libra today, your house of self-esteem. It’s time to stick up for yourself and present your ideas to people who count.

Whether you’re a stay-at-home mom or work in a field that you may feel is not “artistic”, this planetary aspect is super for polishing up your skills–helping your kids with their homework, becoming a better speaker in meetings, or coming up with fresh solutions no one has thought of before.

"
8788,11 october 2016,libra,"Go out tonight and wish upon a star! Wish on two “stars” actually—Mercury and Jupiter, glittering like stars right next to each other in the heavens. These two optimistic, generous planets meet in your sign, a good omen as it will open your mind to possibilities that you may not have considered before. But under current planetary influences it appears that people in your circle may not be over the moon with your new plans and bright ideas. Should you soldier on without them? Maybe. Next week’s full moon in Aries will help you make that decision.

This may be in the forefront of your mind as recent planetary aspects have made people around you on the demanding side.

And you’ll have that opportunity in the days ahead, as tomorrow’s full moon will shake things up.

"
8792,16 october 2016,libra,"It’s your needs versus a partner’s as a full moon takes place in your house of commitment. Rebellious Uranus is active, possibly stirring up your desire for some independence. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll split up. But chances are you’ll ask for space, demand that more needs of yours are being met or expect the other party to pull their own weight.

"
8793,17 october 2016,libra,"The energy of yesterday’s full moon is still in play, which means that you should get down to the nitty gritty when it comes to your closest relationships.

If in doubt, talk it out.

"

Strong forces in the cosmos could be dredging up old emotions and dramas as Mars and Pluto meet in the heavens. This could be difficult as it may make you feel off balance, but it’s actually designed to help you step into your own power. If you need help, seek it. Otherwise, get rid of past demons on your own.

8802,26 october 2016,libra,"With abundant Jupiter finally in your first house of self-esteem after a 12-year hiatus, feeling good in your own mind, and looking good in the eyes of others, should be a lot easier. And a happy angle between Venus and Jupiter today allows you to shine. Reach out to others, self-promote, and and even consider taking a class under this aspect.

"
8803,27 october 2016,libra,"Money talks! And that’s what you should be doing today—talking about making (or saving) mo’ money. A brilliant conjunction between the Sun and intelligent Mercury in your income sector is prodding you to hunt down more of the green stuff—and then bank it. Ask for a raise, look for another job, review your budget, cut expenses, shop for better yields on investments, or start a business. You’ll have the ambition and the smarts to make it happen under this aspect.

"
8804,28 october 2016,libra,"Tired of being the good old dependable you? It’s not your lot in life to be available to everyone 24/7, Libra. A spunky meeting between the Moon and Jupiter in your sign could light a fire under you to do your own thing just this once. With Mars in your house of domesticity and family affairs you may feel obliged to be the responsible person who needs to get things done, but for heaven’s sake—take a break already!

"
8805,29 october 2016,libra,"What you say and how you say it are of critical importance with a standoff between the two most combustible planets in the solar system, Mars and Uranus. However, this doesn’t mean that you should sit there in silence and not express your opinion. Indeed, with stern Saturn on the scene it would be wise to lay down some rules and boundaries at home and in relationships, be they personal or business. Gentle Venus will help you get your point across with diplomacy.

"
8806,30 october 2016,libra,"Every year each sign enjoys a new moon in their income sector, and your’s is today. Since this is the best time to plant new “seeds”, in a manner of speaking, it’s wise to do whatever you can in the weeks ahead to boost your income and increase your savings. What makes this year’s new moon different from past ones, however, is that lucky Venus is only two fortunate degrees away from La Luna. Venus governs profits, and inspirational Neptune also happens to be in a winning angle. Money-making ideas should flow–pay attention!

"
8807,31 october 2016,libra,"Take your time when it comes to considering a proposal, idea, contract or partnership; don’t feel rushed into making a decision. That’s because serious Saturn is involved, indicating that decisions you make today will have a big effect for a long time to come. Yesterday’s new moon may be making you long for security or a routine, but make sure that you’re heading in the right direction first.

"
8808,1 november 2016,libra,"Your prospects for earning (and therefore saving) more money are rising, Libra, and you may understand that better today. A helpful Sun-Neptune angle clears up past questions and confusion about which direction to head in with your career, a problem at the office or how to pitch to a prospective client. In order to think and act more creatively in the future you may need to hire new staff, add a better service provider or change your methods. Do so and witness more green in the months ahead.

"
8809,2 november 2016,libra,"Hey there, butterfly. Don’t you think it’s time to be more social? With the Moon swinging past Venus in your communication sector, you should be reaching out to people and making plans. Yes, duty calls, thanks to hosting the Sun in your house of making money and getting things done. But you need some face time with people who aren’t co-workers or other moms. Try to make some new friends as Saturn’s presence indicates that they could be in your life for years to come.

"
8810,3 november 2016,libra,"Your home environment has been a big focus of the cosmos lately and you would be wise to pay attention. Take charge of domestic matters and dramas before they get out of hand, a good possibility around Thanksgiving. No one wants problems at holiday time, and with commanding Pluto in your house of family you can and should take control. But this doesn’t mean that you have to clobber people over the head. Smooth talking Venus enters this sector on the 9th, enabling you to smooth ruffled feathers with ease.

"
8811,4 november 2016,libra,"With smart little Mercury in your house of routines and security, you should be yearning for consistency and shared responsibility when it comes to the people you deal with on a regular basis. But are they coming from the same place? The only way to find out is to talk things over with them. Don’t play mind reader and make assumptions.

"
8812,5 november 2016,libra,"Time to balance the budget? Take a good long look at your finances today to make sure that you’re on the right track when it comes to saving and spending. This is especially true if you share your finances with a partner or are self-employed. The cosmos is suggesting that you or a partner may be feeling impulsive about spending, which needs to be addressed before it gets out of hand.

"
8813,6 november 2016,libra,"A topic may come up quite suddenly between you and someone close, something that you weren’t expecting to discuss today. This is good news, however, as Venus is involved and wants to smooth the path ahead. Whatever you do, don’t hold back your ideas, feelings or emotions. In the weeks ahead you’ll be able to share your thoughts with many others and make progress along the way.

"
8814,7 november 2016,libra,"Wrap up matters that have to deal with your home base before Wednesday, when Mars moves on to a much lighter place. If family members have been difficult to deal with, remind them who’s the boss today. Routines, rules and boundaries need to be respected. You should be able to get the message across with confidence, and make sure you hold them to it.

"
8815,8 november 2016,libra,"You certainly will be interested in having fun in the weeks ahead, but the cosmos warns that you need to start saving more money. This is especially true when it comes to spending on luxury items that you don’t need right now or the latest fad for the kids. Next week’s full moon in Taurus will make it clear that mindless spending has to come to an end. Over the next six months make a commitment to only buy essentials.

"
8816,9 november 2016,libra,"It’s time to focus on the sweeter side of life, Libra! Romantic evenings out, spending time on hobbies, playing with your kids, trying new restaurants and going to cultural venues all count. So does jazzing up your looks—and your home decor—with chic new accoutrements. Mars has just entered your frisky fifth house of love, glamour and creativity. Artistic Libras can make big progress with their skill level and self-promotion, especially after Mercury enters your communication sector on Saturday. Strut your stuff!

"
8817,10 november 2016,libra,"It may sound counterintuitive that you need to do more planning when it comes to enjoying life, as most people view relaxing as something that should just “flow”. But t seems that you may have gotten into an “entertainment rut”, doing the same old thing over and over again. It’s a big world out there, Libra, with a plethora of sports, hobbies and cultural activities to partake in. A Moon-Neptune meet-up tells you to research your weekend plans in advance and to try a few new things.

"
8818,11 november 2016,libra,"Start trawling the design and lifestyle blogs, Libra! Now that Venus is in your domestic sector it’s time to turn your place into a comfortable haven. Indeed, Mars just entered your creativity zone a few days ago, so start experimenting with new recipes, do it yourself projects and decorating around the house. Keep an eye on expenses, though, as next week’s full moon is all about building your savings and investments.

"
8819,12 november 2016,libra,"This is no time to suffer in silence! Now that candid Mercury has moved into the relating part of your chart it’s imperative to let others know what’s going on in your mind. Not only that, be bold. That person you’ve been crushing on? Ask them out. Ask for the order, the business deal, the commitment. You don’t ask, you don’t get.

"
8820,13 november 2016,libra,"Say what you mean, and mean what you say. A strong Jupiter-Saturn connection will help you get your point across. Not only that, any boundaries or rules that you establish with others will hold. They may have to find out the hard way that you mean business.

"
8821,14 november 2016,libra,"Your financial future reaches a major turning point today, thanks to a megawatt full moon in Taurus. While it’s possible that a windfall could come your way–or a court award, overdue child support, stock dividend–it’s more likely that you will be the driving force behind increasing your net worth. Now is an excellent time to consider becoming a business owner or entering into a joint venture of some kind. Your creativity should be through the roof due to Mars’s influence, but you may have to overcome nervous feelings of stretching past your comfort zone.
 

"
8822,15 november 2016,libra,"With so much planetary activity pushing your skills to the fore and encouraging you to express your innovative ideas, you really can’t go wrong, Libra! The only issue is that Neptune is retrograde in your house of blue sky thinking, perhaps making you unsure about whether some of your plans are actually do-able. They are, something you’ll discover when Neptune goes direct this Saturday.

"
8823,16 november 2016,libra,"La Luna is encouraging you to live outside of your usual comfort zone, but the Sun is demanding fiscal responsibility along with emotional maturity. But that’s OK—you can pull this off! Simply decide to take a small risk, something that doesn’t put you in the hole financially. You may be surprised to discover that a pal or lover wants to be your “partner in crime”, in a manner of speaking. You only live once.

"
8824,18 november 2016,libra,"Feel like being a doormat? Want to do all the grunt work while others around you slack off? If the answer to these questions is “yes” then get ready to be taken advantage of. But if the answer is “no” then you need to be wary today of people who are more than willing to dump their responsibilities on you. You may need to draw a line in the sand, but so be it. Once the Sun changes signs next week you’ll have no problem telling people where to stick it.

"
8825,19 november 2016,libra,"You may feel that your BS meter has been operating non-stop, especially when it comes to dealing with people at the office. Uncertain customers, wishy washy bosses, snarky colleagues and loads of red tape may have made the past five months difficult to wade through. Happily, that ends today as Neptune goes direct. When the Sun changes signs next week you’ll be in a much better position to ask for what you want and actually get it.

"
8826,20 november 2016,libra,"You’ve been working hard, Libra, considering that the Sun has spent the past four weeks in your earnings sector. But it’s scheduled to leave tomorrow, heading for a much more social place. Why not kick back today with a lover or some pals and go off the grid for a few hours? Spontaneous Uranus encourages you to spend some quality time with the people you like the best.

"
8827,21 november 2016,libra,"You have some big decisions to make and now is an excellent time to reach out to others for advice. With the Sun now in your communication sector, you can connect with mentors, coaches, friends, or loved ones for their input. But don’t forget that one of the wisest voices is your own. With optimistic Jupiter in Libra, and serious Saturn in your smart thinking zone, you can figure a lot out on your own.

"
8828,22 november 2016,libra,"Exciting new projects of all kinds can start to present themselves to you, so get ready to dig in and tackle them. You’ll have the energy and the smarts to do so, and some of them could bring long term benefits. With optimistic Jupiter in Libra for the first time in over a decade, you’ll also have the inspiration to go for it. Today is stellar for making progress. The key is to just focus on what you want to do, and not pay attention to the opinions of others.

"
8829,24 november 2016,libra,"Family is the tie that binds, and you may feel that strongly today. Jupiter is in your house of goals and self-esteem, encouraging you to do your own thing, to follow a path designed by you—not your parents, not even your spouse or kids. This doesn’t mean that you’re going to run away from home, but that you may need some space in which to pursue your own passion projects. Problem is, those closest to you may not want you to spread your wings and fly. You’ll be able to discuss this with them at next week’s new moon.

"
8830,25 november 2016,libra,"With next week’s new moon in the most congenial part of your chart you’re about to enter a highly social phase. The problem is that everyone is going to want a piece of you. So how to keep them all happy? You may need to let certain people know that you’re not available 24/7. This may not be easy, considering that Jupiter is making you so optimistic that you think you can juggle it all, but the reality is that you can’t!

"
8831,26 november 2016,libra,"Say what you mean and mean what you say. A serious meeting between talkative Mercury and sober Saturn indicates that your words, be they verbal or written, are powerful right now. Not only that, the things you set in motion can carry forward for years. As a result, this is an excellent time to interview for a job, discuss marriage plans, negotiate a business deal, or start writing a novel. Likewise, if you’ve been holding back your opinions or ideas, now’s the time to let others know how you feel.

"
8832,27 november 2016,libra,"With Tuesday’s new moon coming in your house of candid conversations, it’s time to speak your mind. This is especially true when it comes to matters involving a lover, your kids and money–or a combination of them. Don’t let the demands of other people break your bank or your heart. With serious Saturn in a good angle, you mean business.

"
8833,28 november 2016,libra,"Excellent week to work on written projects, or anything that is a form of self-expression: your art portfolio, film reel, blog, manuscript, thesis, marketing plan or Powerpoint demonstration. With abundant Jupiter in your house of self-image, the work you produce will only enhance your message–and your prestige.

"
8834,29 november 2016,libra,"It’s time to clear the air with the people in your world, and a terrific new moon today in your communications sector allows you to speak candidly. Other planets like Jupiter and Mars are in a great spot, encouraging you to work things out with kids, lovers, and parents in particular. Saturn supports the moon, a good omen as it will allow you to speak your piece with a certain seriousness that others will respect. Oh, and you single people? Go shout it from the mountain that you’re looking for love. With Mars in your house of romance, the stage is set for meeting someone new.

"
8835,30 november 2016,libra,"By all means, aim to be direct today in all of your conversations or anything you put in writing. There’s no room for suffering in silence or playing the passive-aggressive game. Nor should you be beating others over the head like a dictator! That’s because murky Neptune may urge you to cloak your words, act wishy washy or suck it up. Sorry—the Sun will have none of that, thank you. Tell it like it is.

"
8836,1 december 2016,libra,"Take a bow, Libra! The planets are putting you in center stage today. This is a perfect time to dazzle others with your brilliance, whether it’s potential lovers, a prospective boss, your clients or the world via social media and internet presence. With dynamic Mars in the part of your chart that governs creativity and your talents, it’s time to pay attention to your brainstorms and act upon them.

"
8837,2 december 2016,libra,"“Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home” and that saying applies to you, Libra. Your family and home environment will become quite important in the weeks ahead as Mercury has just entered this part of your chart. Make every effort to turn your place into a peaceful sanctuary, whether that means cleaning and decorating, or defusing family arguments and tensions. Mercury will retrograde here on the 19th, and you definitely do not want to bring drama and old problems with you into Christmas or the new year.

"
8838,3 december 2016,libra,"Think it, say it, do it! The planets are lining up to give you the smarts and the motivation to come up with creative plans and then run with them. Communication is the key, as you’ll need to get advice, approval and inspiration from people you trust. This is also an excellent time for self-promotion, and that includes letting admirers know that you’re on the market.

"
8839,4 december 2016,libra,"Hey there Libra, do you feel like sharing some of that charisma you’re oozing these days? With zesty Mars in your house of talent and razzle-dazzle, you’re the person to watch. And today it gets even better with a Moon-Mars-Jupiter connection. This is the perfect time to impress, flirt, connect with or persuade others.

"
8840,5 december 2016,libra,"Albert Einstein famously said, “Once you stop learning, you start dying.” Don’t worry, Libra–you’re not checking out anytime soon. But the planets are  telling you to up your knowledge quotient. Look into night classes, weekend seminars, or podcasts to polish up your skills or just for the sheer joy of absorbing more information. With Venus just about ready to enter your house of creativity, the things you learn could take your life to a much more enjoyable level.

"
8841,6 december 2016,libra,"You need to get things done, and with dynamic Mars in your house of creativity and expression you should have no trouble in showcasing your skills. So much so that you may attract the attention of others, who may want to partner with you in some kind of a joint venture. Should you accept their offer? The planets suggest that you do, as a magnificent aspect on the 12th indicates that a shared vision can go very far.

"
8842,7 december 2016,libra,"Romantic Venus glides into your fifth house of love today, which is a match made in heaven. Over the next few weeks you could meet someone new or fall even more deeply in love with an existing amour. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the fifth house also governs fun and relaxation, so despite the holiday stress you should be carving out some down time. Cultural pursuits are especially favored, such as viewing a museum exhibition, attending a concert, trying a new cuisine or taking up oil painting. Life is too short to always be worrying and working.

"
8843,9 december 2016,libra,"I want, I want! If that’s been your battle cry over the past few months, blame it on abundant Jupiter in Libra. This isn’t about greed; rather, it’s all about living a life that you  create. And with a super aspect today between the Sun and Jupiter, you should be vocal about what it is that you desire. Reach out to the people who can help make it happen. With the Sun in one of the most social parts of your chart you should be networking like mad.

"
8844,10 december 2016,libra,"If you have something important to say, then by all means say it. A serious meeting between the Sun and Saturn indicates that it’s time to express yourself. “Expression” could mean letting others know that you aren’t going to take their nonsense anymore. It could also mean running for political office because you have something to say about the way your town is being run. It could mean penning a novel or setting aside an hour a day to work on your illustration skills. With Saturn involved, whatever you work on can really go the distance.

"
8845,11 december 2016,libra,"Why waste time explaining yourself? Trying to prove to your friends and family that you feel or think a certain way is fruitless, Libra. Sometimes you just gotta show them what you’re all about through your actions. Next week’s full moon is pushing you to color outside the lines, and the people closest to you may be resisting the bold new you.

"
8846,12 december 2016,libra,"Tomorrow’s full moon could put you and your talents on a much bigger (and brighter) stage. Are you ready for the spotlight? Teaming up with collaborators could be the best way to go right now. Don’t be surprised if someone asks to form an alliance. Just make sure that this is the right person before you jump in. With aggressive Mars going into your house of work assignments next week, you don’t want to be doing all of the heavy lifting.

"
8847,13 december 2016,libra,"Live free or die! That’s the state motto of New Hampshire, but it could be your battle cry over the next few days. Blame the spunky attitude on today’s full moon in Gemini which is casting your gaze on wide open places and blue skies. One thing’s for sure—you’re not going to want to be tied down, and that could include your closest relationships with people. If you have felt stifled in a romantic or business alliance, resistance may be building as you consider other options. With lusty Mars in your romance zone, you may want a love affair with lots of fun and little responsibility!

"
8848,14 december 2016,libra,"What’s on your mind shouldn’t necessarily be on your lips, Libra! Sometimes discretion really is the greater part of valor. Serious, sober Saturn in your house of the mind is helping you to think in a rational manner and plan things wisely. But that doesn’t mean that everyone else around you gets that. Keep your opinions to yourself until Saturday, a much better time to hold meaningful conversations with others.

"
8849,15 december 2016,libra,"Someone in your immediate environment may act out of sorts today, and it may catch you off guard. Try not to get emotional about it as you may immediately feel the need to use strong words in response. The ancient Taoist masters always used to say, “To control others requires force. Mastering yourself requires strength.” Keep that in mind as you focus more on keeping your own mindset calm and stable, rather than the words or actions of another.

"
8850,17 december 2016,libra,"Partnering with other people is a good idea right now. Why try tackling a project by yourself when it can be done more efficiently (and perhaps more creatively) with the help of others? It could be planning a party or a trip. Maybe you should join forces with people at the office who share the same mindset and work ethic. When energetic Mars enters Pisces on Monday, your work load is going to increase. Start sharing—and delegating.

"
8851,18 december 2016,libra,"Stop comparing yourself to other people, Libra! You’re fine the way you are. Life is not a contest to see who dies with the most toys or the best Instagram account. If you find yourself wishing for things today that are currently beyond your reach, remember that the most abundant planet in the solar system–Jupiter–will be blessing you into October of 2017.

"
8852,19 december 2016,libra,"Who needs to wait til New Year’s Eve to start a diet and fitness program? If you want to get going now, the planets are in your favor. The same holds true for ridding yourself of nagging health problems. That’s because determined Mars moves into your sixth house of wellness today, its first visit here in a few years. With Mercury retrograding in your house of comfort, make sure that you don’t push yourself too hard, too fast.

"
8853,20 december 2016,libra,"With Mercury retrograde don’t be surprised if certain people or situations make you feel uncomfortable. You’re in quite the “can do” mode right now, so if you sense that someone is slacking or is throwing up roadblocks in a passive-aggressive way, you’re probably right. Don’t sweat it. Charge forward without them if need be. Pretty soon you’ll feel on top of things to the point where you won’t even notice them.

"
8854,21 december 2016,libra,"Right now the cosmos is creating a tug of war between your home life and work responsibilities. Which one will win? From the looks of it, your family and home will rule between now and New Year’s. The mighty Sun enters your domestic zone today, asking you to create more quality time for loved ones—and a bit more organization at home too! If you’re the one who’s doing all the grunt work by yourself, it’s time to delegate tasks. The 27th and 28th are perfect for laying down the law.

"
8855,22 december 2016,libra,"You could become quite moody or confused about the direction a romantic relationship is taking, a feeling that may increase in the week ahead. A partner could be acting erratically, sending mixed signals. Whether you can handle their drama or you’re pretty much done with it will be determined around the time of the new moon on the 29th.

"
8856,23 december 2016,libra,"You may realize that one of the best ways to lower your stress level is to become more organized, and with the emotional Moon in a good angle to Mars this may become a 2017 resolution. Examine your habits and routines today for weaknesses. By Monday the 26th you’ll be ready to start pulling things together. The entire week between Christmas and New Year’s is full of positive aspects for streamlining your life.

"
8857,24 december 2016,libra,"It’s a smart move to network over the next few days as you never know who might be able to help you–in work, love or in introducing you to new friends and neighbors. With lucky Jupiter in your sign you’re sure to make a good impression, so don’t be shy. Someone may suggest a business alliance in the near future, and this could pick up speed after the 29th.

"
8858,25 december 2016,libra,"An exchange of ideas is in the air, so get out there and mingle with as many people as possible. This could be a creative venture, a new friendship or a love relationship. With magnetic Venus in fine form today you’re looking like the cat’s pajamas. With lucky Jupiter in your sign you’re becoming more self-assured–and it shows.

"
8859,26 december 2016,libra,"As optimistic as you may be about the future, you may be concerned about the direction a romance has been taking. You’re needing more freedom these days as you’re getting in touch with your true nature, thanks to abundant Jupiter in your sign. While this doesn’t mean that you’re going to split up, it can mean that you need to work out how you can pursue your own interests and ambitions within the confines of a relationship.

"
8860,27 december 2016,libra,"Sometimes simplicity is best, and the cosmos asks you to consider “feng shui-ing” your life. With motivator Mars and inspirational Neptune both in your house of simplifying and organizing, it’s time to declutter your house, office and mind. When the clutter goes away, so will a lot of stress.

"
8861,28 december 2016,libra,"If you’ve been wondering about the best way to handle a drama or issue with someone close, the next few days will provide you with some clarity. The good thing is that a practical solution will emerge, one that you’ll know in your heart is the right one. Whether the people around you agree or not is another issue, but they’ve been getting away with difficult behavior for far too long.

"
8862,29 december 2016,libra,"Relationships may have been up and down over the past few months, and you may have been unsure as to which steps to take. Well, the confusion and waiting are over as rebellious Uranus resumes direct motion. You’ll definitely be craving more security and comfort thanks to the new moon in Capricorn, so start taking the necessary steps to remedy any problems. The best part is that you’ll be in a practical, no-nonsense mood–no rose colored glasses this time.

"
8863,30 december 2016,libra,"Opening up your heart and being more vulnerable could be the ticket to greater peace of mind today with a happy meeting between the Sun and Neptune. You’ve been doing a lot for other people lately–now it’s time to let others know that you need some tender loving care also.

"
8864,31 december 2016,libra,"Got some bright ideas? It wouldn’t be surprising, not with intelligent Saturn firing up your house of thinking and self-expression. The good thing is that Saturn is all about practicality, so you can keep things real. Optimistic Jupiter is also in your corner telling you to take a chance. What a great way to roll into 2017!

"
8865,1 january 2017,scorpio,"Still hanging on to that piece of mistletoe? If not, go out and grab some because a highly romantic aspect takes place today in your house of love. Singles, Mars will light a fire in your heart to find someone in 2017. The red planet meets up with Neptune today, so all Scorpios will  be affected positively. A pregnancy could occur over the next four weeks too as Venus glides into this part of your chart on Tuesday.

"
8866,2 january 2017,scorpio,"You’re only as good as your skill set, Scorpio, and the cosmos is pushing you to polish up yours. Whether it’s being a more convincing sales rep, a more creative graphic artist or a more eloquent speaker, developing more talent is the way to go right now. With so much planetary activity in Pisces over the next few weeks, this is your best time in 2017 to learn more so that you can earn more.

"
8867,3 january 2017,scorpio,"Yum! Romantic Venus joins lusty Mars and amorous Neptune in your house of love today, setting off plenty of sparks. Attached Scorpios should be planning some luxe (even decadent) date nights with their beau or belle. Singles, the next four weeks rock for meeting a lover who’s perhaps more interesting than some of the characters you’ve been involved with in the past! Just don’t get swept off your feet too quickly, a possibility under these aspects.

"
8868,4 january 2017,scorpio,"You’re ready for some big  changes in 2017 and the upcoming full moon on the 12th is the perfect time to launch new initiatives, whether they’re personal or business related. But you might want to spend the next week focusing on making more money as Mercury retrogrades into your income sector today. If you started a job search before the holidays, reconnect with people and companies you contacted before then. Throw yourself into developing new products, services and prospecting plans. It’s also a smart move to review your budget at home and at the office—and plug the leaks!

"
8869,5 january 2017,scorpio,"If you’ve been a little slow getting out of the starting gate so far in 2017, don’t sweat it. Mercury is retrograde in the sector that deals with habits and routines, so now is a good time to come up with some smarter ones that will serve you well. Besides, the passionate Moon meets up with energetic Uranus today, lighting a fire under your tush to get moving. As physicist Isaac Newton so correctly stated, “An object at rest will remain at rest until a force sets it in motion.” May the force be with you, Scorpio. You’ll develop even more momentum after Mercury goes direct on Sunday.

"
8870,7 january 2017,scorpio,"Your passion toward your work can speak volumes today, Scorpio! Reach out to clients, colleagues and employees as you’ll be persuasive and confident. And as we all know, confidence is charismatic. Not feeling the love toward your job? Then it’s high time that you did. When Mercury goes direct on Sunday you’ll be able to pursue a career option that will be more in tune with who you really are.

"
8871,8 january 2017,scorpio,"Financial affairs can spring forward now that Mercury has gone direct in your house of income, savings and budgeting. This is a great time to reconnect with prospective clients you were trying to close or a potential new boss who might have been talking to you about a job. It’s a smart move also to examine your budget, both at home or in business, and plug and leaks. Things could really gain momentum at the time of Thursday’s full moon, so have all your ducks in a row.

"
8872,9 january 2017,scorpio,"Your heart and your head may be at odds today, making it difficult to see a situation for what it really is all about. The upcoming full moon on Thursday will help you step away from matters, almost as if you’re being lifted to a mountaintop so that you can see the bigger picture below you. Avoid the tendency to cling to old, outdated notions.

"
8873,10 january 2017,scorpio,"There’s usually no shortage of drama in an office setting as someone always has to be the Queen Bee or Mr. Know It All. Well, today and tomorrow they’ll be in full diva mode, to which you might say, “So what else is new?”  What’s new is a tense Sun-Uranus aspect that spells trouble if you decide to engage in conversation with these people, or via text and e-mail. Even people you think you can trust may have an agenda, so be on your guard.

"
8874,11 january 2017,scorpio,"You’re in an unusual situation, Scorpio, in that both your logical mind and intuition are both operating at warp speed. As a result you can make smart decisions and communicate beautifully. But that’s you,  though. The problem today is that others may not be as straightforward, rational or motivated as you are. The full moon in Cancer tomorrow will bring out the visionary in you, but you may have to work on those visions by yourself for awhile.

"
8875,12 january 2017,scorpio,"Initiatives that you began months ago could start to wrap up quite nicely, Scorpio. You’re in a highly productive place these days, with intelligent Mercury now in your house of thinking, writing and communicating. There’s also a full moon today in the sector that governs publicity, publishing, and going international. Even if you don’t end up on a public stage your ideas are lofty and can really go places. Been considering going back to school or attending a seminar? Now’s the time to book it. However, the full moon is involved in a grand cross, which indicates that there could be some passive-aggressive types or malcontents in your midst. Don’t let them get in the way of your vision and plans.

"
8876,13 january 2017,scorpio,"Pull out all the stops this weekend and make some plans to have a good time! The Moon is in frisky, flirty Leo for starters. Then, Venus and Neptune, the two most romantic planets in the heavens, just met up in your house of amour. It’s a time for glamour, looking fine and enjoying the attention of admirers–not to mention falling in love with someone new or spicing up an existing romance.

"
8877,14 january 2017,scorpio,"Keeping your feet on the ground could be a challenge under current cosmic conditions! But what’s so bad about being in love or feeling passionate about life? Enthusiasm is contagious, and with chatty Mercury now in your communication sector you can shout your bright ideas and emotions from the mountaintops. Private convos with a lover or your kids can also go well, and domestic matters shine after the Sun enters Aquarius next Thursday.

"
8878,15 january 2017,scorpio,"Sometimes the best advice you can receive comes from within, not from outside.  The planets recommend that you disregard the opinions of friends, colleagues and even a lover as there may simply be too many voices clamoring to be heard over the next few days. Fortunately for you, abundant Jupiter is in your house of intuition, and yours will be in fine form, especially on Wednesday of this week.

"
8879,16 january 2017,scorpio,"This is an excellent day for brainstorming, especially with others. Whether it’s a volunteer group, your friends or a departmental team at the office, toss around ideas that will help you make some positive plans for the future. A difficult Moon-Mars aspect indicates that not everyone will agree on the direction, and there could also be “creative differences”. But these pass quickly, with Wednesday being a super time to work them out.

"
8880,17 january 2017,scorpio,"Time to set new boundaries with a lover or your kids? If things have gotten out of control it’s up to you to regain it. With aggressive Mars in this sector, though, you run the risk of coming on too strong. Likewise, be careful of trying to push through an agenda of yours with someone close. Patience, Scorpio–next week is perfect for communicating.

"
8881,18 january 2017,scorpio,"Hey there, Van Gogh! Scorpios are looking like the creative geniuses and artistes of the zodiac these days, brimming with bright ideas. Jupiter is stirring up your creative mojo in the house of the subconscious mind as Mars helps you express your talents and skills. A helpful aspect between the two of them today suggests that you refine your methods a bit. All forward thinking people recognize the need to sharpen their mental tools.

"
8882,19 january 2017,scorpio,"Excitement, romance and luxury are all desirable, but at what cost? Today a tense standoff between Mars in your house of fun, amour and creativity and stern Saturn in your income sector suggests that you find a balance between spending and carousing. Not only that, more security seems to be necessary in romantic partnerships as well. If you’re unsure as to where a relationship is going, ask questions and demand answers.

"
8883,20 january 2017,scorpio,"Home is where the heart is, and now that the Sun is in the most domestic and comfort-driven part of your chart, you’ll want not only a peaceful home environment but a happy romance to accompany it. Fortunately for you the two cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, are together in your house of amour. Better yet is that verbal Mercury is in a good spot to help you communicate. Singles, your best bet for meeting someone new is by socializing and putting in face time, not on line.

"
8884,21 january 2017,scorpio,"The Moon is in your sign this weekend, Scorpio, a positive placement as it puts you first! La Luna sends a beam to Chiron in your creativity sector, suggesting that it’s time for a makeover. Chiron is knows as the wounded healer, and the first step you should take to to cleanse yourself of old hurts that may have negatively impacted your self esteem.

"
8885,22 january 2017,scorpio,"Friday’s upcoming new moon in one of the most sensitive and comfort-driven parts of your chart is already having an effect on you, Scorpio. Today a happy moon-Sun aspect recommends that you examine your emotions to understand better what makes you feel unsettled or insecure. With generous Jupiter in the part of your chart that governs the subconscious mind and our deepest thoughts and feelings, you can make headway.

"
8886,23 january 2017,scorpio,"Progress can be made in a career matter, especially when it comes to scoring a higher income. A positive Moon-Saturn aspect in your earnings sector bodes well for job hunts or landing a promotion. This Friday’s new moon takes place in your house of security and comfort, so increasing your income will definitely be on the forefront of you mind. Just make sure that you’re not lured in by flattery and empty promises, a possibility with deceptive Neptune in a funky mood.

"
8887,24 january 2017,scorpio,"You’re a man or woman with a plan, thanks to intelligent Mercury stoking your desire to ponder, plan and verbalize what you’d like to manifest. Today the messenger planet forms a sparkling aspect with inspirational Neptune, helping you come up with even more good ideas. It’s an excellent week to discuss your ideas with others, sign up for a class, sharpen your skills or find a mentor who can help you take things to a higher level.

"
8888,25 january 2017,scorpio,"It’s time to switch up your methods of communicating, Scorpio. As the emotional Moon signals transformative Pluto in your self-expression sector, you’re being advised to find new ways to get your point across to people you love or work with. Perhaps you need to be more stern or direct. Maybe you need to be more flexible or forgiving. Your intuition is spot on, so use it to your advantage and to find peace.

"
8889,26 january 2017,scorpio,"Need to reexamine your expectations about love? That seems to be the case with a Venus-Jupiter connection. However, as these are two of the most optimistic and abundant planets in the solar system, they’ve got your back. Maybe you’re setting your sights too low, settling for crumbs at the love banquet. Perhaps you’re too busy comparing yourself to other people. Whatever it is, make sure that you’re not settling, but at the same time that you don’t have pie in the sky fantasies about amour.

"
8890,27 january 2017,scorpio,"A fabulous new chapter is opening up in your home and family life thanks to today’s new moon in Aquarius. One of the items on the planets’ agenda is your neighborhood: are you happy there? Do you want to move? Stay? Perhaps you should get more involved in local activities, such as the political scene or helping establish a farmer’s market on the weekends with organic produce. Your finances are looking good too, especially long term if you’re thinking about buying or decorating. Just go slow with the spending and stretch purchases out over the next six months.

"
8891,28 january 2017,scorpio,"So many things to do, so little time! Current planetary aspects are putting you in a spot where you could be very busy with chores and projects both at home and the office. Today energetic Mars enters your super-organized sixth house, encouraging you to get your act together with better systems and habits.  As a result you may not know where to begin. Clean out the basement? Empty your e-mail accounts? Hire better people? Oh, and by the way—this is also the house of diet and fitness. You’ve got your work cut out for you.

"
8892,29 january 2017,scorpio,"Get the word out! An energetic and productive meeting between chatty Mercury and powerful Pluto sets the stage for shameless self promotion. This is a great time to work on your brand, portfolio, thesis, marketing plan, blog or website. The key is to be as detail-oriented as possible now that Mars is in your house of “the fine print”.

"
8893,30 january 2017,scorpio,"Yum. It’s a sparkling day for romance as the passionate Moon meets up with amorous Neptune. It’s also a terrific time to spend with your kids, so clear your schedule today of all chores and just relax with the people you love. Singles, your best place for meeting someone this week is not online but in person, so get out there and socialize.

"
8894,31 january 2017,scorpio,"Right now your head may be spinning with ideas and details thanks to hosting two of the most energetic planets in the cosmos, Mars and Uranus, in your get-things-done house. While this is a super set-up for blasting through your chores and coming up with creative ideas, it can also cause information overload. Today’s Mercury-Uranus square could fry your circuits. Slow down, count to ten, and just take things one step at a time.

"
8895,1 february 2017,scorpio,"Aarghh! An emotional smackdown between the Moon and Jupiter could make you feel as though there aren’t enough hours in the day to get everything done. From your chart it appears that you need some R & R, but when will you ever find the time? After the 6th, that’s when. Mighty Jupiter will retrograde in your twelfth house of cocooning, nurturing and extreme self-care. Wrap up as many tasks as you can before then, because you’re going to be taking a siesta.

"
8896,2 february 2017,scorpio,"Is it time to pull away from the pack? Whether it’s your friends, your colleagues or society in general, it looks like you need a little down time–alone. Sometimes we get so caught up in what other people are thinking, doing, and scheming that we lose our objectivity. Take a break to recharge your batteries and to get a better perspective on what’s going on in your world.

"
8897,3 february 2017,scorpio,"Been promising yourself forever that you’re going to break a habit or get organized? It should be easy to do over the next month now that planet of ease, Venus, is in your house of efficiency. You can also get into a much more vibrant state of health by sticking to a diet and exercise regimen. Besides, you’re going to need to be both healthy and productive. The lunar eclipse on the 10th falls in your house of ambition, so rest up now.

"
8898,4 february 2017,scorpio,"Just how much should you share? With Jupiter getting ready to go retrograde in your house of confidentiality, you may be in a self-protective mode. But the gas giant will be direct all weekend and the Moon is in a helpful spot, so if you have something to say then say it. Let the chips fall where they may. You have a lot on your plate and don’t have time to endlessly ruminate about how other people are going to take it.

"
8899,5 february 2017,scorpio,"They say that flattery will get you everywhere, but today you have to make sure that you’re not at the receiving end of someone’s insincerity. A close connection could resort to guilt or poor-little-me routines in order to get what they want. When Jupiter retrogrades tomorrow you’ll become even more conscious of the games people play and the manner in which you react. Stay on your toes.

"
8900,6 february 2017,scorpio,"If there’s any sign that is entitled to pick up and move to a beach shack in Tahiti (or a mountaintop in Nepal) so that you can meditate, it’s you, Scorpio. Don’t forget massages, naps, plopping down with a good book, silencing your phone and ignoring everyone’s drama. But this is reality, so your chances of actually doing so are slim. What’s a Scorpio to do? Go within. Jupiter is retrograding in your twelfth house of silence and healing, a perfect aspect for healing your tired mind, body and soul. This aspect will last until early June, so you’ll have plenty of time to unwind.

"
8901,7 february 2017,scorpio,"A strong pull to home and family could arise over the next three weeks as Mercury enters your domestic fourth house. Even if you’re single the desire to have roots and a comfortable place to come home to will be strong. A female figure in your life, such as your mom or grandmother, could influence you–even if they have crossed over! This is the perfect time to think back to times spent with women who meant  a lot to you, and the lessons you learned from them.

"
8902,8 february 2017,scorpio,"Power struggles may erupt and it could be hard to tell who has your back. This is not a good day to voice your opinion too strongly, as someone may resort to snarky tactics in response. Protect your ideas too, as they seem to have merit and could be worth some cash down the road. Tomorrow is a  much better day for cooperation, both at home and the office.

"
8903,9 february 2017,scorpio,"A sudden “Martha Stewart moment” might strike, Scorpio, so don the rubber gloves and start scrubbing. Seriously, erratic Uranus in your ultra-organized sixth house is on a roll, so don’t be surprised if you have an insatiable desire to organize your sock drawer and the spice rack. By the way, this vibe continues into the weekend, so power up with caffeine and roll up your sleeves. As Martha says, “It’s a good thing.”

"
8904,10 february 2017,scorpio,"OK, I have a special news flash for all of you Scorpios out there who are tired of hearing the following: “Jupiter is in Libra, so things will move slowly and you have a lot on inner work to do besides.” While that may be true, many Scorpios are chomping at the bit these days, wondering when the hell things are going to start picking up momentum. Tonight, baby! A luscious Leo lunar eclipse in your house of ambition starts to green light projects that are near and dear to your heart. Whether you’re looking for love, want to lose weight or patent an invention, mighty Leo starts greasing the wheels. Other planetary aspects in place today recommend that you start with your career. There could be a sudden job opening or client who wants to do business with you, so look alive.

"
8905,11 february 2017,scorpio,"A happy meeting today of the Sun and abundant Jupiter is perfect for developing closer bonds with the people who mean the most to you. Our home and roots matter more than we realize sometimes. Reminiscing and feeling nostalgic are part of the energy that the cosmos has on offer, so spend some quiet time honoring your ancestors and the people in your life right now.

"
8906,12 february 2017,scorpio,"Hesitancy may arise when it comes to handling issues with loved ones, especially a lover or kids. Two of the most confusing orbs in the solar system, the Moon and Neptune, are at odds in the sectors that govern your nearest and dearest. Perhaps you’re worried that you and a lover don’t share the same values, or you can’t figure out the best way to discipline a child. The fog starts to lift on Tuesday and is gone by Saturday when the Sun enters Pisces.

"
8907,13 february 2017,scorpio,"Some kind of plan that you have for your family or residence may need tweaking today, Scorpio. Perhaps you realize that you need to save more in order to buy the kind of home you desire, or you have to get your parents set up with better medical care. Home-related issues will be on the front burner from now through the 23rd, and the aspects are all good ones for making progress.

"
8908,14 february 2017,scorpio,"Yeah, baby! Can we shag now, or should we shag later? The Moon and Jupiter in your fantasy-fueled twelfth house could stimulate some interesting boudoir activity. But other planets will keep you down to Earth, demanding that a lover be good relationship material as well. With mature Saturn in your financial zone, you’re not willing to take chances on a broke but charming amour.

"
8909,15 february 2017,scorpio,"Overwhelmed by details or your duties? It could catch up with you today. It appears from your chart that you’ve been way too optimistic about what you can achieve in a 24-hour period. Start scheduling in some down time just to unwind. Your mental health needs as much care as your body does.

"
8910,16 february 2017,scorpio,"You can’t stop a moving train by standing on the tracks, something that people around you should figure out! You’re on a roll, Scorpio, developing momentum as you push through projects like a hot knife cutting through a stick of butter. Keep doing what you’re doing. It will pay off down the road with a greater sense of comfort and security.

"
8911,17 february 2017,scorpio,"Lines could get crossed with a family member, landlord, roommate, lover or contractor who works on your home. You especially need to make sure that everything is understood before you proceed with any kind of big decision or venture. That said, next week’s energy for anything related to your house or family looks terrific, starting on Monday.

"
8912,18 february 2017,scorpio,"Ah, sweet romance! The cosmos is ready to deliver some juicy goodies your way now that the Sun is in your fifth house of fun, frolic and amour. Over the next month you can experience more joy and quality time with your lover and your kids, too, as children are part of the fifth house. The lunar eclipse on the 26th falls in this part of your chart, and with unpredictable Uranus in a tight angle, something sudden could happen around that time. From your chart it appears that it’s a happy occurrence, so stay on your toes.

"
8913,19 february 2017,scorpio,"Now that the Sun is in your house of romance, you should be ready for some flirting and racy date nights. But all Scorpios, single or attached, are going to be demanding security and some guarantees from a lover. With other planets in house that are quite focused on comfort and domesticity, playing around just for kicks isn’t in the stars.

"
8914,20 february 2017,scorpio,"Do something wonderful for others and you help yourself at the same time. Spontaneous Uranus is in your house of giving selflessly, and today it forms a happy aspect with Mercury. If you have an idea or a desire to help people or animals in need, or the environment, act on it.

"
8915,21 february 2017,scorpio,"Aahh, sweet relief. A wonderfully healing aspect helps you sift through old mental baggage and let it go. It’s especially good for releasing old family dramas that may still be affecting you. It’s time to 86 this trash, as the upcoming eclipse on Sunday falls in your house of fun and romance.

"
8916,22 february 2017,scorpio,"Got one nerve left–and everyone’s working it? That’s the way you may feel today as work projects or household chores and personal errands begin to overwhelm you. With dynamic Mars in your get-things-done house, you’re being pushed to knock items off your to-do list. Problem is, you may be so overworked that you’re about to snap. Slow down.

"
8917,23 february 2017,scorpio,"Being happy with your home and personal life carries forward into other areas of your existence, so it’s smart to ensure that you have security and comfort there. A helpful Saturn-Mercury aspect will enable you to talk matters over with loved ones. Saturn’s goal is to bring you long-term stability, so if something is shaky, it may need to go.

"
8918,24 february 2017,scorpio,"A nice balance between your head and your heart exists today, so use it to create more harmony in your life. A wildly creative time is just about ready to begin due to Sunday’s solar eclipse in your house of living authentically. Consider what you can do to enjoy a more innovative lifestyle.

8919,25 february 2017,scorpio,"Big doin’s are coming your way in romance! Today verbal Mercury enters your flirty fifth house, then tomorrow a solar eclipse takes place there too. It’s time to put your feelings out there if you’re involved with someone. If you’re single the next six months could bring in a hot new honey. Get out there and start socializing.

"
8920,26 february 2017,scorpio,"Turning point! Your love life reaches a major moment due to a solar eclipse in Pisces, the last one in a series that has been going on since 2015. A new chapter is about to begin. Fed up with your lover? It may be time to go. But if you’re happy then an even more amorous stage will evolve. Singles could meet someone between now and September, but avoid moving too quickly.

"
8921,27 february 2017,scorpio,"Keep your radar turned on, Scorpio. Someone may not have your best interests at heart; indeed, they may be working their own agenda and trying to figure out how you can play a part in their game. From your chart this appears to most likely be someone at the office, and they could be quite pushy about it. But don’t allow yourself to be manipulated by anyone, at the workplace or your personal life. Take your time in making key decisions.

"
8922,28 february 2017,scorpio,"Your motivation to get things done, both at home and at work, is rising as a super spontaneous Mars-Uranus aspect is lighting a fire underneath you. That doesn’t mean, however, that everyone shares your level of enthusiasm, nor do they have your work ethic. You may be tempted to blast them into the stratosphere but it will backfire. They’ll just dig in their heels and resolve to do even less. Let it pass.

"
8923,1 march 2017,scorpio,"Go glam, Scorpio! A sweet meet-up of get-gorgeous Neptune and the sizzling Sun tells you to make over your looks. These two heavenly bodies conjunct in your fifth house, which not only governs romance but also creativity. It’s time to break away from an outmoded self-image and try on a new persona. While you’re at it, expect a lot of attention from admirers.

"
8924,2 march 2017,scorpio,"Attention to detail can be a beautiful thing. After all, that’s how works of art were created by the Masters. And you certainly wouldn’t want to be operated on by a surgeon who doesn’t pay attention to the smaller things—like your nerves and blood vessels! But problems can arise when you’re so hell bent on the minutiae that you become a control freak. The planets warn that you’re pushing yourself too hard, perhaps to the point of placing your physical and mental health at risk. Loosen up your grip on the reins.

"
8925,3 march 2017,scorpio,"You may need to take on a more active role in a business or romantic partnership, or perhaps simply become more vocal. With Venus about to retrograde for four weeks there could be disagreements about who’s carrying more of the load in the alliance. Try to work this out before Saturday when Venus starts to backslide.

"
8926,4 march 2017,scorpio,"“If you want to get something done the right way, you have to do it yourself.”  That saying may be running through your mind over the next four weeks as Venus retrogrades in your work sector. People around you may not be pulling their weight, slowing down your progress as a result. But it’s also possible that you’re the one who’s starting to slack, so unless you want to anger the boss or clients, stay on top of your work. The good news is that your creativity will rise, so this is a good time to perhaps deliberately slow down with projects and figure out a more skilled way to complete them.

"
8927,5 march 2017,scorpio,"This is one of your best days all year to create new habits, routines and protocols, both at work and at home. With disciplined Saturn in a good angle to motivator Mars, you’ll have both the drive and the stick-to-it-iveness to truly get things done. Over the next four weeks continue to come up with hacks that will streamline your life.

"
8928,6 march 2017,scorpio,"With assertive Mars getting ready to move into your commitment sector on Thursday, now’s a good time to have a talk with your lover about the future. The authoritative Sun and eloquent Mercury will help put the right words in your mouth. No need to yell or issue ultimatums…just say your piece. And singles, start spouse shopping if that’s your aim. The next few days are fortuitous for meeting someone new.

"
8929,7 march 2017,scorpio,"“But we’ve always done it this way!” Those kinds of thoughts may be running through your mind, or you’re surrounded by folks who are stuck in an old worn out routine. Busting out of past patterns may not be easy today, but give the matter some thought. The rest of the week is super for thinking—and acting—more creatively.

"
8930,8 march 2017,scorpio,"Why are you hiding your talent, Scorpio? You’ve got it—so flaunt it! Today’s energy is perfect for demonstrating that you have the chops to get something done with flair and originality. But why not take your skills to a higher level while you’re at it? Sign up for a class or lessons. Improve your golf game, watercoloring skills, public speaking ability, decorating flair, parenting skills, Spanish, or managerial talent.

"
8931,9 march 2017,scorpio,"Teamwork takes center stage in the month ahead. Today Mars enters your house of partnerships which includes business and romantic alliances. And then with next week’s full moon falling in your house of groups and networking, it’s who you know—rather than what you know—that will inform your life in the future. Don’t try to go it alone, Scorpio. Two heads are better than one—and three are even better than that!

"
8932,10 march 2017,scorpio,"Opportunities can open up for you in the near future, both in love and business. Today the Moon urges you to examine just how much you’re enjoying life versus how hard you’re working. The key is to find more balance. With Sunday’s full moon approaching in your house of camaraderie, you’ll be doing more socializing in all areas of your life, so get ready to network.

"
8933,11 march 2017,scorpio,"You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar, the saying goes, and you would be wise to pay heed. Your intuition is operating at full throttle, but just because it gives you a heads up about someone’s agenda doesn’t mean that you should call them out on it. Keep your opinions to yourself and put a smile on your face.

"
8934,12 march 2017,scorpio,"Team and group efforts can take off like a shot thanks to the full moon in Virgo, but some of the roles and responsibilities of individuals may need to be switched up in order to achieve the best results. And if you’re considering launching or revising a website, Etsy store, online venture or social media campaign, this lunation can provide you with the leverage and publicity that you need.

"
8935,13 march 2017,scorpio,"Managing your time, work flow and even the actions of other people will become important over the next few weeks. Now that Mercury is in your ultra efficient sixth house, you not only have to make sure that you’re on top of your own game at home and the office, but that other people are too. Just don’t get too pushy as others will deliberately put up resistance.

"
8936,14 march 2017,scorpio,"You’re in an excellent spot for enjoying emotional healing today, thanks to a meeting of the passionate Moon and optimistic Jupiter. However, if you want to make headway you’ll need to change your mental habits and the way you think. Self-help seminars, affirmations and therapy sessions all have their place, but they need to be followed up with by solid, healthy routines.

"
8937,15 march 2017,scorpio,"With Venus retrograde in the sector that deals with close relationships–such as a lover or business alliance–you may be questioning your next move. It’s a smart time to do so, because once the Sun moves into this part of the sky on the 20th you’ll have some decisions to make. Just how passionate do you feel about love, life and your occupation?

"
8938,16 march 2017,scorpio,"Gotta love it when the cosmos inspires us to get organized! Inertia can be a powerful force (just ask Isaac Newton) and it often seems that we need to be catapulted into taking action. But a more languid Moon-Neptune aspect today can get you on the path to efficiency and streamlining without a lot of angst.

"
8939,17 march 2017,scorpio,"You could be feeling mighty passionate these days—about a person, project or a cause—but you need to keep your emotions in check. Stern Saturn warns that passion needs to be tempered with discipline and logical thinking. And while you’re at it, develop better habits and routines that will channel that passion in a constructive way.

"
8940,18 march 2017,scorpio,"Look out, world! The planets are aligning in just the right way for Scorpios to turn into whirling dervishes of efficiency. This ultra-productive stage kicks off today with a meeting of profitable Venus and intelligent Mercury in your house of getting things done. You won’t be in the mood for tolerating slackers and delays, that’s for sure. Start strategizing this weekend about what you’d like to accomplish over the next month.

"
8941,19 march 2017,scorpio,"You can’t do it all, Scorpio. If you need help at home or the office you need to delegate and/or hire folks who can pick up the slack. Once the Sun enters Aries tomorrow you are in for one exhausting but productive time period. Chores and assignments will pile up. However, you’ll be motivated to blast through them. Just make sure that you’re not the only one carrying the load.
 

"
8942,20 march 2017,scorpio,"Move over, Martha Stewart. There’s a new organization whiz in town and they’re a Scorpio. Now that the Sun is in your ultra-efficient sixth house of getting things done, you’ll be highly motivated to knock things off your to-do list both at home and at the office. And what happened to that New Year’s diet and exercise regimen? Did that fall by the wayside? The sixth house governs your physique and health, so get back on track.

"
8943,21 march 2017,scorpio,"Between now and the end of the week, try not to take what you hear and see at face value. There are people in your midst who are saying one thing but thinking and planning differently. While tomorrow is a better day to communicate and get to the root of matters, you need to stay on your guard through the end of the month.

"
8944,22 march 2017,scorpio,"Change your approach with people if you want to make headway. Maybe you need to come on stronger. Perhaps you should pull back. Over the next few days people could be difficult to read or be just downright difficult. It may seem like everything is a big chess game but by next week some of the flak will start to dissipate.

"
8945,23 march 2017,scorpio,"Squabbles, arguments, pissing matches—that’s what’s on tap today. Sounds like fun, huh? Well, a stinky Pluto-Mercury square is setting the stage for people in your world to not only be vocal, but impractical while they’re mouthing off. And it continues into tomorrow. My advice? Take a vow of silence for the next 48 hours and don’t get involved.

"
8946,24 march 2017,scorpio,"No matter how much you want to believe in others—that they’re straightforward, honest or share your beliefs—you need to be a bit wary. A tense Jupiter-Mercury face-off in the heavens indicates that someone in your midst may have an agenda, one that does not favor or support you. Let both your intuition and logical mind guide you over the next few days.

"
8947,25 march 2017,scorpio,"Everyone wants a sexy, healthy body, but not everyone is prepared to pay the price—and I’m not talking about paying for liposuction. Fortunately for you, diet and exercise regimens should be a lot easier to start and maintain thanks to take-it-easy Venus in that sector today. There will be a new moon here on Tuesday too, and with disciplinarian Saturn in your house of routines and habits, you can really stick to your plans this time.

"
8948,26 march 2017,scorpio,"Many creative people claim that they can’t get their artistic juices flowing if their place is a mess. Regardless as to your occupation, getting organized both at the office and home could lead to a burst of inspiration. Spontaneous Uranus is in fine form today from your highly efficient sixth house, telling you to get off your butt. A messy desk is not always the sign of a creative mind!

"
8949,27 march 2017,scorpio,"With libidinous Mars blazing a path through your commitment sector, you want a lover who’s not a dud in the sack. Well Scorpio, you’re in luck! Mars forms a glorious aspect with amorous Neptune, helping to put some sizzle back into your sex life. This coming Thursday is also a yummy day for romance, so book some alone time with your lover.

"
8950,28 march 2017,scorpio,"Little things add up, Scorpio, something that today’s new moon will remind you about. It occurs in your organized, efficient sixth house, which not only deals with our habits and routines, but our physical health. This makes sense, as glowing health is the result of solid habits followed day after day. This is your best time in 2017 to get your act together—at the office, at home and your level of fitness and vitality.

"
8951,29 march 2017,scorpio,"Negotiations with clients, service providers and supervisors are well aspected today, thanks to a prosperous Mercury-Saturn connection. This energy is also auspicious for applying for a new job or going on an interview. There is some serious long term potential involved with whatever transpires today, so put your best face and effort out there.

"
8952,30 march 2017,scorpio,"Keep your opinions to yourself today, as a tough Jupiter-Pluto aspect indicates that you might spill to the wrong person. Someone in your midst could be a frenemy or passive-aggressive, working their own agenda while they smile to your face. Don’t be surprised if someone tries to push your buttons or twist your arm into doing things you don’t want to do. Quietly stand your ground.

"
8953,31 march 2017,scorpio,"The recent new moon on Tuesday fell in the house that helps you make progress at the office. Helping matters along is the entry of hard-working, intelligent Mercury into your partnership zone today. Why do all of the grunt work by yourself? It’s time to hook up with another person who shares your work ethic and ideas. It could be a formal business partnership or simply finding a co-worker whom you can trust to share the load. Get moving before April 9th, because Mercury goes retrograde then.

"
8954,1 april 2017,scorpio,"Business collaborations could be the ticket to expanding your influence and earning more, but don’t expect overnight success. Mercury will be retrograding in a week’s time in your house of partnerships, along with Saturn moving backward in your income sector next Thursday. If you have the patience and foresight to put in the effort and wait patiently, success is a foregone conclusion.

"
8955,2 april 2017,scorpio,"Drama alert! Love planet Venus retrogrades into your house of amour through the 15th. But from your chart it appears that you want nothing but the truth and straight talk. As a result, make sure that the drama isn’t coming from you, as your  behavior is all you can really control. This Thursday is a much better time to get to the bottom of things and hold constructive talks.

"
8956,3 april 2017,scorpio,"Now that Venus is retrograding in your romance sector, love will be on your mind. And today the emotional Moon is linking up with amorous Neptune, increasing your desire to experience only the deepest kind of love. But while you’re blissfully daydreaming, don’t forget the “finer points”, also known as the nitty gritty: who’s going to do the laundry, clean the house, raise the kids, deal with the parents and so on. It ain’t sexy but neither is a relationship in which people are fighting over this kind of stuff.

"
8957,4 april 2017,scorpio,"A work project or personal to-do may go off the rails, courtesy of a tense Moon-Uranus aspect. Maybe it’s your medical insurance company denying a claim that they should be covering. Perhaps a co-worker drops the ball. A client may pitch a fit over something that’s not worth it. Just keep calm and carry on. The good news is that with the Moon in your far-sighted house of visionary thinking, you’ll be able to work around these people.

"
8958,5 april 2017,scorpio,"Show off your stuff today! Impress bosses and clients with your can-do attitude and talent. With magnetic Venus in your house of skill development this is also a good time to sign up for a class or seminar. The good news is that this can pay off financially too.

"
8959,6 april 2017,scorpio,"Tighten up the purse strings, Scorpio! Saturn has just gone retrograde in your house of earning and saving money, which is an aspect that will last for several months. Cash flow could get a little tricky, bosses might be slow to sign off on a raise, and potential employers might take their sweet time. Clients could also drag their feet when it comes to signing deals or making decisions. Patience will be your greatest virtue, along with setting aside savings for a rainy day.

"
8960,7 april 2017,scorpio,"It appears from your chart that your tired mind and body need a rest, but that household errands and work demands are piling up with no end in sight. A difficult Sun-Jupiter aspect today might bring all of this stress to a rolling boil. The full moon next Tuesday in your house of healing and self-care will push you into finding ways to relieve these pent up feelings. Maybe you need to meditate. Perhaps more physical activity is in order. You will find a way.

"
8961,8 april 2017,scorpio,"Get ready for some resistance, Scorpio. People in your world may be as stubborn as mules, refusing to cooperate, listen or complete their share of the work load. This could be at home, the office or in a love affair—so you’ll need to be on your guard! The problem is that you may decide to come on strong with power broker Pluto in your house of communication. Don’t go there, but don’t be a pushover either.

"
8962,9 april 2017,scorpio,"Tuesday’s full moon is a game changer as it will encourage you to cut ties and habits that are no longer working for you. But before the moon looms large in the sky, Mercury retrogrades today in your seventh house of serious partnerships. Are all of your connections solid? Are you working with the right kind of people in business, such as an attorney, booking agent or writing partner? Is a romance budding, or has it reached its sell-by date? Take an honest assessment.

"
8963,10 april 2017,scorpio,"Your imagination is getting fired up with so much planetary activity taking place in the house of the subconscious mind. But should you share your ideas with others? Maybe not. Someone may try to talk you out of a stellar idea as they work their own agenda. Don’t let anyone pass judgment on your passions and brainstorms.

"
8964,11 april 2017,scorpio,"With a full moon in the house of the mind, you may have fears and doubts bubbling to the surface. But you’re in a far better spot than you might realize. Self-esteem isn’t a prize that you win; it’s a part of you that’s already there, a part that you need to get in touch with. Let the fears go. Take control of your thought process and don’t let the monkey mind control you.

"
8965,12 april 2017,scorpio,"What a day for a daydream! The luscious Moon trines inspirational, romantic Neptune. Splendid ideas can percolate in that head of yours, and the best part is that you’re not in fantasy land. Not even close. With the Sun in your practical, efficient sixth house you can take these dreams and flesh them out.

"
8966,13 april 2017,scorpio,"Be patient with those who aren’t moving at the same pace as you, whether it’s their thought process or tasks they’re completing. You’re in one heck of an efficient place, ready to take charge and get things done. You’re also in a good spot to motivate the troops, so put a smile on your face and help them see the light.

"
8967,14 april 2017,scorpio,"An opportunity may seem to come out of the blue at the office: a promotion, a job offer from a competitor or a new prospect who wants to do business with you. The planet Uranus is a real live wire, and it acts up today–in a good way. Likewise, you may simply become incredibly inspired to get a handle on your job or things at home. Go for it, because moments like this don’t happen enough!

"
8968,15 april 2017,scorpio,"If your love life has been stranded on a reef like a ship waiting for the tide to come in, good news–the wait is over. Romance planet Venus has been retrograde in your house of amour for over a month, possibly creating drama, conflicts, jealousy and other problems. Today, however, it resumes direct motion, so matters of the heart can get back on track. Just make sure that things don’t move too  quickly.

"
8969,16 april 2017,scorpio,"Sweet! Venus is now direct in your house of romance and today it winks at lusty Mars in the commitment sector. Hmmm…is someone getting ready to settle down? Or maybe you’re booking some quality alone time with your amour. This is a terrific day for love–enjoy it.

"
8970,17 april 2017,scorpio,"Finally, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Projects or clients that you have been developing are now starting to gel, thanks to a positive Sun-Saturn connection. But before you move forward you need to pay close attention to the details, as El Sol is in your house of efficiency. Your life is about to get busier–clear off your desk and get caught up with the small stuff.

"
8971,18 april 2017,scorpio,"Putting people in their place may be a necessity as the Moon and Pluto meet up in the verbal part of your chart. Just try to keep things rational and don’t get too emo, a possibility with the Moon’s influence. This is a situation that is going to repeat itself in the weeks ahead after Pluto retrogrades on Thursday. So if there are some people who need to be told off and you don’t get around to them today, don’t worry. You will.

"
8972,19 april 2017,scorpio,"Can we talk? Now that the Sun is in your commitment sector it’s time to hold some serious convos with both romantic and business partners. Try to clear the air today if you can, as mighty Pluto is about to retrograde in your house of communication. People may be pushy or not willing to reveal their hand over the next few months, so get ready to develop some patience–and the ability to read between the lines.

"
8973,20 april 2017,scorpio,"Between Mercury and  Pluto both retrograding today, you definitely need to watch what you say and put in writing. Mercury starts to back stroke in your efficiency sector which deals with the day-to-day activities you have to take care of at home and the office. As a result, you need to handle your chores with care and read the fine print on everything from medical insurance premiums to client presentations to your e-mails. People won’t necessarily be upfront with Pluto swimming backwards, so you’ll need to dig for information.

"
8974,21 april 2017,scorpio,"Money can flow into our lives but flow right back out again if we’re not careful. Aggressive Mars is now in your house of fiscal responsibility, which can work two ways. With this aspect you either get serious about saving and cutting down your debt, or you start to spend like there’s no tomorrow. Well, there is a tomorrow and it will be here soon. Get real and save for the future.

"
8975,22 april 2017,scorpio,"Your heart may be saying, “Spend, spend, spend” while your logical brain is clutching on to your wallet with a death grip. Beautiful baubles, shiny new cars, electronic toys and designer clothes may be enticing but the cosmos warns against going on a spending spree. Even if you’re not tempted by big ticket items you could be spending too much on dining out, movie nights and concerts. Cut back a bit and start to save more dinero.

"
8976,23 april 2017,scorpio,"A sweet, flirtatious day lies ahead as love planet Venus winks at the Moon. Plan a fun day with your honey or head out the door to turn heads; you never know who you might meet! The sector that these two are both in also governs art and culture so it’s the perfect day for a gallery crawl followed by cocktails and dinner at an ethnic restaurant. No TV, beer or pizza allowed.

"
8977,24 april 2017,scorpio,"Bringing order to your work flow has a number of benefits, the least of which is lowering your stress level. A powerful Mercury-Saturn trine today also promises more cash coming your way if you start to buckle down and become more productive. After all, if you want to earn more it’s a must that you’re caught up and done with the old projects that were on your desk. Make room for more money.

"
8978,25 april 2017,scorpio,"Shake up the ways you go about running your business or doing your job, Scorpio. We tend to get into a familiar groove when it comes to this, especially if our jobs and incomes are stable. But a superb Uranus-Saturn aspect today tells you to break the old rules and routines and try some more creative methods of getting things done. The good news is that if you’re willing to do so, your income will rise as well.

"
8979,26 april 2017,scorpio,"Business alliances are the way to go over the next six months courtesy of today’s new moon in your partnership sector. Even if you’re used to flying solo, the cosmos advises that you retain the services of a savvy expert who can help take your career to a higher level. It also appears that some profitable new assignments are coming your way, so you may need to enlist the help of others.

"
8980,27 april 2017,scorpio,"A new chapter can open up in romance if you’re willing to put in some effort! Yesterday’s new moon fell in your commitment sector, and its job is to help you enjoy a more balanced and intimate relationship. A happy Moon-Pluto trine enables you to open up the lines of communication. Singles, you should get out there and socialize as much as possible. Face to face beats online these days.

"
8981,28 april 2017,scorpio,"Practicality rules the day as Venus enters your no-nonsense sixth house. This holds true in matters that involve love, family and work. Let others know (sweetly, of course) that you expect them to do their share, which will make for a better situation for all involved. But at the end of the day it all comes down to your personal habits and routines. How solid are they? Are you living a life of ease, or is it one calamity after another?

"
8982,29 april 2017,scorpio,"Setting boundaries with loved ones isn’t always easy but it needs to be done. Strict Saturn is telling you to play by the rules, and if you’re doing that so should the people around you. Don’t give in to guilt trips or head games coming from them. You’re going to be in a no-nonsense mood over the next few weeks and you need to get things done.

"
8983,30 april 2017,scorpio,"Seems like you’ve been raising your standards lately, which is always a good thing! The Moon in Cancer is encouraging you to think bigger and bolder than usual, and the good thing is that the people around you might actually share your vision. Whether it’s a spouse or a business partner, speak up about what’s on your mind. The planets are in quite a collaborative mood.

"
8984,1 may 2017,scorpio,"Like it or not you’re going to need the cooperation of other people over the next few weeks in order to get things done. The problem is that they may not be in the mood to help, or they can’t understand your vision for some reason. The fog will start to clear on Wednesday. And with next week’s full moon in your sign, you’re stepping into a position of greater authority.

"
8985,2 may 2017,scorpio,"Finally, some relief is on the way in your home and office environments. Logical Mercury has been retrograde in your efficiency sector, snarling up even the simplest of tasks. It goes direct tomorrow, but there is a some good stuff going on today: a sizzling Moon-Mars aspect that tells you to start planning your next career coup. Once the full moon arrives next week in your sign, you’ll be unstoppable.

"
8986,3 may 2017,scorpio,"Phew! Mercury is now direct in your house of productivity and getting things done. If you’ve been mired in red tape, surrounded by slackers or held back by inefficient systems you can now move forward. If you spent the past few weeks examining your habits and protocols and then made changes, good for you. If you didn’t then you should start now. Don’t be afraid to delegate tasks to your kids, spouse or co-workers. You’re not a mule.

"
8987,4 may 2017,scorpio,"Winning people over to doing things your way becomes a heck of a lot easier today, thanks to take-it-easy Venus winking at the Moon. This vibe is only going to increase over the next week, dontcha know. That’s because the full moon on the 10th occurs in your sign. Your authority level is rising along with your charisma, but you won’t have to beat anyone across the head to get your point across.

"
8988,6 may 2017,scorpio,"The green-eyed monster might show up on the scene, and it could be coming from the general direction of your friends or a lover. On the other hand it may be you with the envious attitude, so keep it real. Jealously snooping someone’s Instagram or Facebook pages and imagining that they’ve got it better than you isn’t going to help your situation. And if you’re at the receiving end of someone else’s vitriol, don’t get involved. Next week’s full moon is in your sign and you deserve the goodies that life has in store for you.

"
8989,7 may 2017,scorpio,"You may feel like going within today, whether that means resting quietly at home, going for a walk in nature or heading off to a movie by yourself. Sometimes “alone time” is the best way to charge your batteries and to clear your mind. You have an active week ahead in which you’ll be speaking out, mingling with others and pushing hard at work. Don’t feel guilty about resting up.

"
8990,8 may 2017,scorpio,"Pay closer attention to your practical side rather than your emotions, Scorpio. The Moon may be stirring up insecurities and past dramas which are now occupying way too much space and time in your brain. The question is, are they based on reality? Probably not under current planetary conditions, so let them go. Wednesday’s full moon falls in your sign, kicking open new doors. Walk through them unencumbered by the past.

"
8991,9 may 2017,scorpio,"Yeah, baby! Romance gets a lovely reboot thanks to a super Sun-Pluto aspect today. Speak up about what you want from a relationship and what you expect in the future. Make plans to take a quick vacation, maybe a long weekend to a nearby locale. Singles, this is an excellent time to meet a keeper. Face to face is better than online right now, so get out there and mingle. Don’t overlook seminars, book signings, trade shows and hobby conventions as bars have their limits.

"
8992,10 may 2017,scorpio,"Woo-hoo! Tonight’s full moon is in your sign, so it’s showtime, baby. What is that YOU really want to see happen over the next year? Some seeds that you planted in 2016’s birthday season may finally be sprouting, so get ready to enjoy the fruits of your labors. But this is also a smart time to initiate new projects. And even though this lunation is all about you, don’t be surprised if others want to join Team Scorpio. Your can-do attitude has been duly noted.

"
8993,11 may 2017,scorpio,"Your sign is famous for its jealous streak, Scorpio, and even if you’re the most chill scorpion on the planet, you might be feeling bit testy today. That’s because aggressive Mars squares deceptive Neptune, an aspect that might push all of your buttons the wrong way. Obsession, fear, anxiety, resentment and yes, envy—all of these icky little demons might be running rampant. This is most likely to occur in romance. But the good news is that tomorrow is a complete 180, a time when you can work things out calmly.

"
8994,12 may 2017,scorpio,"Feel like starting a meditation practice? Maybe reiki? Or perhaps you want to develop your psychic skills. A vibey trine between Mars and Jupiter sets the stage for going deep within and summoning up the powers of your subconscious mind. Head to a metaphysical bookstore and see what courses or gatherings they might have. Or do your own thing at home with a vision board and online podcasts. It’s time to get in touch with a deeper, more nurturing side of yourself.

"
8995,13 may 2017,scorpio,"You’re becoming a lot more serious about the state of your financial health—or at least you should be, according to the planets! The question is this: are the people around you as determined as you are to save and invest? If you share finances with another person, like a spouse, it’s time to have a talk with them about fiscal responsibility. This includes your kids too. Even if you’re single you should be planning for the future, not waiting for some glorious day in the future when you’ll meet someone and have two incomes to live off of.

"
8996,14 may 2017,scorpio,"It looks like it’s time to get back in touch with a lover and what they’re thinking, Scorpio. Today’s energy gives you the chance to do that, and it would be a wise move on your part to open up the lines of communication. That’s because Mercury enters your commitment sector on Tuesday which will bring up topics of all kinds. Clear the air now while you can! And singles, someone with long term potential may arrive on the scene, so create a short list of the attributes you want them to have.

"
8997,15 may 2017,scorpio,"You may need to gain control over some kind of discussion, group activity or negotiation, whether it’s in your personal life or elsewhere. Just make sure to temper your words with the right tone as aggressive Mars is active today. Otherwise you run the risk of of coming off too emotional or domineering, not the impression you want to give off.

"
8998,16 may 2017,scorpio,"Rebalance your bonds with partners. Develop deeper levels of commitment. Be more willing to give and take. Now that knowledgable Mercury is in your house of committed relationships, you need to clear the air with a lover or business alliance. Singles, the next three weeks are auspicious for finding someone who could be a keeper.

"
8999,17 may 2017,scorpio,"Facing up to issues that you’ve been avoiding becomes a simpler task as the Moon forms a gentle aspect with healing Jupiter. But this is just the preview of a longer period of reflection and closure that begins on Saturday, when the Sun glides into Gemini. Between now and late June you’ll have the opportunity to come to grips with some of your deepest emotions, especially those that deal with love—past and present.

"
9000,18 may 2017,scorpio,"You can make terrific progress with work assignments these days, Scorpio, but the key is to remain focused and block out the office politics and drama. This won’t be easy, because people will be trying to pull you in to the latest gossip fest. If you work out of the house or you’re a one-person operation, you may find yourself dawdling and focusing on insignificant things rather than the big picture. Snap out of it!

"
9001,19 may 2017,scorpio,"“If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.” That can be excellent advice, especially if you’re making good money and your systems at work seem to be operating smoothly. However, a meeting between staid Saturn and spunky Uranus tells you to reexamine your assumptions. No matter how successful you are, there could still be some hacks that will make your work flow more efficiently. And if you’re not earning what you’d like to be making, it’s time to make a change. Figure out how to get on top of tasks, ask for a raise, add a new product or service to your line, switch up your marketing tactics, learn a new trade. Between now and November you can experience a quantum shift.

"
9002,20 may 2017,scorpio,"You’re entering into what could be one of the most prosperous times of the year, thanks to the illuminating Sun gliding into your net worth sector. Over the next four weeks you can negotiate better mortgage rates, pay down debt, enter into profitable business deals or create passive income streams. The problem is that aggressive Mars is in this sector too, which could make you way too anxious to succeed. Anything of value takes time to come to fruition. Also, you may be tempted to spend or take on too much debt, not a wise idea under current planetary aspects. Be circumspect to the point of being thrifty.

"
9003,21 may 2017,scorpio,"It may not be romantic, but let’s face it–relationships need to have a balance when it comes to who’s going to do the cooking, cleaning and child raising. After all, feeling like the hired help in a marriage or live-in situation ain’t romantic either. So if you need to have a little chat with a Significant Other about the level of effort they’re putting into getting the grunt work done, today’s a good time to do so. Singles should streamline their chores to free up more time for play.

"
9004,22 may 2017,scorpio,"Sore muscles, sciatica, allergies, headaches–yuk! Not only do they give us pain but they drain our energy. Fortunately, healing Venus is in a good spot today to help you address the more “minor” health problems that we all have to deal with. (Major problems, the kind that require surgery or more aggressive treatments, are in another house.) Take advantage of this aspect to consult with medical professionals, and while you’re at it, make a vow to eat better and exercise.

"
9005,23 may 2017,scorpio,"Paring down to the essentials is the message that the cosmos has for you these days, Scorpio. This goes for all areas of your life, from the foods you eat to the work projects you take on to the things you buy. It’s time to feng shui everything, which certainly can’t happen overnight. With disciplined Saturn helping you develop positive new routines and habits through December, you can make enormous progress. A nice added benefit? More serenity, less stress.

"
9006,24 may 2017,scorpio,"A funky planetary mix of reality and fantasy are in your chart these days, Scorpio. On the one hand Pluto is telling you to get organized with your chores and avoid unrealistic thinking, especially when it comes to love. Then some other aspects are turning up your libido, which usually clouds our vision! Make time for romance but don’t forget that a solid relationship also depends upon an equitable distribution of chores and responsibilities.

"
9007,25 may 2017,scorpio,"Take baby steps! That’s the message from the cosmos as the new moon occurs today in Gemini. While new moons open doors, and this one is designed to help you score some big money and enjoy love at the same time, you need to take it slow. Aggressive Mars is in “I want it NOW” mode, but wise Saturn demands caution. Know what you’re getting into in love and finance before you join forces with someone else.

"
9008,26 may 2017,scorpio,"You may be on the verge of (finally) getting some of the recognition you deserve, either for a job well done, being a good parent or for a good deed. This may result in some new opportunities coming your way and they could arrive unexpectedly. They say that karma can be a b**** but I say it can also be a blessing.

"
9009,27 may 2017,scorpio,"Money talks and bulls*** walks, as they say. A lot of people around you may be talking  about big bucks but if you want to get your hands on your fair share, you’ll need to be practical—and you’ll also need to be in control. Tough guy Pluto is in your house of brainstorming and strategy, and this little dude recommends that you’re the decision maker. Think about this if someone wants to enter into a partnership, or promises to pay you commission or a piece of the action. Would you be better off doing your own thing?

"
9010,28 may 2017,scorpio,"Tuning in to what other people need is easy this week thanks to a number of planets in your houses of perception and close connections. While you may want to help others, limit your assistance to emotional support and logical advice. Lending money to someone may sour the relationship–and you may not see the money again.

"
9011,29 may 2017,scorpio,"There’s nothing wrong with wanting the finer things in life, but they cost money….and you may not have enough liquidity right now to pay for the things on your wish list. Aggressive Mars is burning a path through your debt sector, and you may be sorely tempted to go on a spending spree. Don’t. Serious Saturn, the logical planet that deals with long term consequences, opposes the red planet today. It’s time for fiscal responsibility.

"
9012,30 may 2017,scorpio,"Mars is pushing your money buttons, urging you to make more. There is an inventive spirit in the air, so a solution may come to you that you hadn’t considered before (and it’s legal, too. No Breaking Bad  here). Whether you figure out a way to impress the boss or decide to get a passive income stream going, it’s green lights ahead.

"
9013,31 may 2017,scorpio,"It’s essential to be open and honest with people today, but the good news is that they will be able to take it! Smooth talking Mercury allows you to chat openly with a lover, business associate, friend or family member. If you make sure to listen to their side of things you can’t go wrong. They need to know that it’s a two way street.

"
9014,1 june 2017,scorpio,"Need to know where a relationship is going? Today’s the time to get this topic out there in the open. Saturn, the planet that puts stability into long term arrangements, is in a super angle to love planet Venus. Already coupled up rams can make concrete, practical plans with their amour. With next week’s full moon approaching in your house of security and guarantees, you need to know exactly where you stand.

"
9015,1 june 2016,scorpio,"Hold on to your wallet, Scorpio! A tense angle between the Sun and Neptune indicates that you and your money could part ways. No, I’m not talking about your pockets being picked. You might be tempted to spend money on something that can wait or be passed up, such as that designer bag that you simply must  have. Luxury items, expensive vacations and toys (cars, electronics), more goodies for the kids–do you really need to buy them? Think feng shui. And retirement that doesn’t include living in a cardboard box under a bridge.

"
9016,2 june 2017,scorpio,"Your financial future gets a terrific boost from one heck of a positive aspect, a trine between the powerful Sun and abundant Jupiter. This is a good time to get approved for a mortgage or line of credit. Maybe a silent partner is willing to finance your business idea. Private talks about a business alliance may take place. Your intuition could guide you to a new way for earning a passive income. But you have to quiet your busy mind first!

"
9017,2 june 2016,scorpio,"Romantic day ahead with the passionate Moon in your commitment sector winking at amorous Neptune in the house of love. This is a good day for singles to meet a new flame and for attached Scorpions to turn up the heat in their relationship. There’s a highly karmic feeling to all of this. Do I dare utter the (much hyped and overused) word “soulmate”?

"
9018,3 june 2017,scorpio,"It’s time to snap back into a steady routine and get a handle on all of your to-dos and work projects, both at home and at work. Fortunately for you, this should be an easy process rather than a gritted teeth exercise. That’s because Venus, planet of ease, is in a sparkling mood today, hooking up with impulsive Uranus. If you need to get your romance into a more structured setup, start planning weekly date nights or working out together at the gym.

"
9019,3 june 2016,scorpio,"As Sunday’s new moon approaches, you’ll be thinking about romance and just how much intimacy, bonding and juicy sex you need in a relationship. Sure, it’s all well and good to share the same values, but a partnership has to have some sizzle. The problem is that today’s Grand Cross will twist your head around worse than an ice cream cone at Tastee-Freez. Do you have a partner who makes you feel secure—but he’s a little too safe? And that red hot sexy mama is sure easy on the eyes, but what’s going to happen when she meets your parents? Don’t make a decision today. Wait until Monday when the Sun sheds some light on your frazzled little brain.

"
9020,4 june 2017,scorpio,"Now that Mars is in the most adventurous part of your chart you’ll be thinking about living life in a more colorful way. Whether you switch up your career, wardrobe, travel plans or personal connections, you’ll be on the hunt for more stimulation. This happens to be a highly philosophical sector, so you might start studying the thoughts and writings of anyone from the ancient Buddhists to modern day self help gurus. The key is to open your mind.

"
9021,5 june 2017,scorpio,"Temper, temper! Keep yours in check today with a tense Neptune-Sun square. You’ll need to keep your wits about you anyhow as this aspect could bring out the more deceptive side of people. Problem is, your mind could start imagining dramas that aren’t based on reality, so even if people are being straight up you may not recognize it. Fortunately level-headed Mercury changes signs tomorrow, enabling you to think with greater clarity.

"
9022,6 june 2017,scorpio,"Dramas that may have been simmering in your love life start to dissipate, thanks to chill Venus entering your commitment sector today. Regardless as to the state of your union–blissfully happy or teetering on the edge of Splitsville–you now have the opportunity to enter into a fa more satisfying and romantic time. Singles, a new love could arrive on the scene, someone with long term potential.

"
9023,7 june 2017,scorpio,"They say that money talks. Other times it whispers, as far as I’m concerned. And now that super smart Mercury is in your house of wealth, you can act like a bloodhound on the trail of mucho dinero. You may have to do some heavy research, but the opportunity to discover prosperous passive income streams is there. Be patient, talk to people in the know and do your homework.

"
9024,8 june 2017,scorpio,"You and a lover could use some quiet time alone to reacquaint yourselves with each other. The same holds true for kids: your own, maybe your grandkids or a favorite niece or nephew. And the key is to spend quality time talking with each other and sharing thoughts, important to do considering that healing Jupiter is in your house of solitude.

"
9025,9 june 2017,scorpio,"It’s always rewarding when long hours, focus and hard work all come together in a successful conclusion, and that’s what might happen over the next few days. Tonight’s full moon in Sagittarius could bring a win, something that has to do with your career or income. Any major decisions you make over the next few weeks will be sound ones, as logical Saturn is in a good angle to the Moon. A new job, assignment or client could come your way in a rather sudden or unexpected manner. Pop the champagne!

"
9026,10 june 2017,scorpio,"Hallelujah. Optimistic Jupiter finally goes direct after being retrograde for four months, during which time you may not have felt so….optimistic! That’s because this usually abundant planet was backstroking through one of the most emotional parts of your chart, the twelfth house. This is the sector which encourages us to close out chapters of our lives that aren’t serving us on our journey, such as bad habits, toxic ties and negative thought patterns. If you did the necessary inner work, you’re now in a good place to move forward.

"
9027,11 june 2017,scorpio,"Decision making becomes easier (and faster) thanks to Uranus, planet of genius, being active today. Your emotions and logical mind will be working in tandem, so you can count on making the right choices.

"
9028,12 june 2017,scorpio,"Keeping your feelings to yourself? Then let them flow as a productive Mercury aspect helps you find the right words. It’s high time that you stood up for yourself. But this isn’t a day for drama; there’s an optimistic vibe in the air that’s healing and abundant.

"
9029,13 june 2017,scorpio,"Emotions could get the better of you today due to a confusing Mercury-Neptune square. You might have your eye on a “bright shiny object”–meaning a hot new lover, a job option that you think will be an improvement, some expensive swag–but you could be getting caught up in the allure of having it. Rely more on logic than desire.

"
9030,14 june 2017,scorpio,"You’ll be in a security conscious mood as the emotional Moon forms a positive aspect with mature Saturn. Instability in love, career, your health or finances won’t be acceptable to you, so do what you can today to shore up your circumstances. Over the next week the realization may hit you that a lot of changes need to be made, and they could be austere.

"
9031,15 june 2017,scorpio,"Don’t be so hard on yourself, Scorpio! Yes, you have a lot on your plate, but there are only 24 hours in a day. Over the next few days you may feel hopelessly behind in many areas of your life. Are you being realistic about your schedule and workload? Sunday is a good time to reflect on this topic and come up with better solutions.

"
9032,16 june 2017,scorpio,"Reality check! Neptune, confusing even on a good day, goes retrograde in your house of romance and children. Don’t let a kid or a lover run circles around you with stories that sound suspicious. Even if they’re being straightforward, it’s possible that they may decide to slack, so unless you feel like being a maid you need to keep them in line. Singles—watch out for sexy but slimy potential lovers who sound too good to be true, not to mention exes who are on the rebound.

"
9033,17 june 2017,scorpio,"One of the most creative phases of 2017 is about to open up for you, Scorpio, so toss out old ideas as to how things should be done and consider some new ones. Now that Neptune is retrograde in your artistic and innovative fifth house, you can plumb the depths of your talent. And when the Sun changes signs next week your ability to think in broader brushstrokes will only increase.

"
9034,18 june 2017,scorpio,"Your head and your heart are working in perfect sync today, so use this energy to work out any questions on your mind. The same vibe reoccurs on Tuesday, so don’t feel as though you have to solve big issues before sundown. Once the Sun enters Cancer on Wednesday you’ll be feeling more optimistic about where you’re heading.

"
9035,19 june 2017,scorpio,"Financial negotiations could get mired in disagreements as Mercury opposes Saturn. These are two of the most logical planets in the solar system, so when they face off against each other it’s not because deception or fantasy thinking are going on. Rather, there may simply be two opposing viewpoints that need to be considered before a decision can be made.

"
9036,20 june 2017,scorpio,"It’s always a good thing when the cosmos lights a fire under our butts to get something done, and today your sign is the lucky winner of the kick-in-the-butt bonanza. The areas that you should be focusing on are your health, fitness level and net worth. Some out of the box thinking may be required, such as finding a new treatment for a health problem, which could require working with a different physician. As long as you’re willing to try new avenues you can make some nice progress.

"
9037,21 june 2017,scorpio,"The lazy, hazy days of summer are officially here north of the equator, but if you’re smart you’ll devote a good deal of time toward achieving what’s most important to you. That’s because El Sol and his buddy Mercury have just entered your house of success. The fact that these two are a team is awesome, because the Sun will fire you up while Mercury enables you to think, prioritize and communicate with decision makers. Don’t worry, you’ll still have time to hit the beach.

"
9038,22 june 2017,scorpio,"Don’t get carried away with yourself, Scorpio! True, the optimistic Sun and vivacious Mercury just entered your “big picture thinking” sector, but tame some of your ambition. In matters of the heart and creativity especially, things may take longer to manifest than you realize. Be patient.

"
9039,23 june 2017,scorpio,"With tomorrow’s new moon arriving in your house of taking calculated risks, you should be thinking about how you can push yourself past your current limitations. Fortunately intelligent Mercury is on the job, helping you find a way to live a more passionate life.

"
9040,25 june 2017,scorpio,"A mish mosh of planetary aspects may find you raring to go one moment, daring to take a chance–and then the next minute pulling back as your subconscious mind stirs up fears and worries. The good thing is that optimism and confidence will win this battle, but it may take til midweek before you feel that way.

"
9041,26 june 2017,scorpio,"They say that kids spell the word “love” as T-I-M-E, and I’d say that the same holds true for your relationship with a lover. A super Mars-Neptune aspect gives you the chance to book some quality time with the people you hold most dear. This energy goes on all week, so make play time a priority.

"
9042,27 june 2017,scorpio,"The initiatives that you take over the next few weeks have success written all over them, as your ability to think big is heightened by so much planetary activity in Cancer. Today a bold stroke of brilliance and creativity may strike, so pay attention to that “theater ” in your mind, the place where new ideas play out.

"
9043,28 june 2017,scorpio,"Bold moves are the order of the day as megawatt Mars encourages you to take a risk. Fortunately, logical Mercury is standing close by, preventing you from doing something really stupid! And if you’re standing on the sidelines, overwhelmed by the prospect of leaping in, remember this old (but corny) saying: “by the inch, it’s a cinch. By the yard, it’s hard.”

"
9044,28 june 2016,scorpio,"Projects with coworkers or team members could hit a snag, and better communication is the key to getting back on track. Jupiter’s presence indicates that overall, the project has excellent long-term potential. Make sure you stick with rational thought rather than emotion to get a point across.

"
9045,29 june 2017,scorpio,"With so much planetary activity in your adventurous house of big thinking, you’re more than ready to dive into something new. But someone nearby might be hell bent on pulling you down to Earth with a bump. It could be a lover, family member or co-worker, but it also could be Big Brother. Do you need a special license or permit? Does a banker need to see a business plan? Be prepared to do some explaining to the people who are putting up walls.

"
9046,29 june 2016,scorpio,"Keep your eyes and ears open for an opportunity that could improve your finances, as something may crop up unexpectedly. It could be office gossip that suggests that someone is leaving (therefore opening doors for you), an idea for a business or a new way of handling workplace flow that will result in greater profits down the road.

"
9047,30 june 2017,scorpio,"You need a time out, Scorpio. Any kind of project that the world will see needs to be refined before it’s ready for prime time. This could be your resume, a dance performance, your wedding plans, a product launch, a college application or a manuscript. With the Moon in the house of inner wisdom, ask yourself what needs to be tweaked.

"
9048,30 june 2016,scorpio,"Hold on to that wallet, babe! Luxury-loving Venus is telling you that you deserve all sorts of expensive treats, but Pluto on the opposite side of the solar system is saying, “No way!” The recent full moon on the 20th fell in your income sector, designed to help you earn more. Make sure you save some before you start spending it.

"
9049,1 july 2017,scorpio,"A little mystery is always helpful in a girl’s (or guy’s) arsenal, so be a little more secretive and alluring when it comes to matters of the heart. Schlumping around the house in stretched out sweats with a beer bottle in your hand may feel comfortable, but it ain’t sexy. Time to become an agent provocateur.

"
9050,1 july 2016,scorpio,"Nothing but green lights ahead! Scorpio, you are the envy of the zodiac, as two of the most helpful planets in our solar system are linked arm in arm today. Venus and Jupiter are telling you to toss aside restrictions, outdated notions, fear, and lack of confidence…and to go for it.

"
9051,2 july 2017,scorpio,"Trying to start over with a clean slate, a new beginning? That wouldn’t be surprising with Mars in your optimistic house of grand ideas. But other people may be attempting to either confuse you or “help” with what they think are the facts. While it’s wise to listen to experts, in the final analysis you have to make your own decisions.

"
9052,2 july 2016,scorpio,"What does security mean to you? A half million dollars in the bank and a fleet of exotic cars, or just a few thousand bucks and a steady job? Today’s expansive planetary aspects ask you to reconsider your ideas as to what you think it will take to make you feel safe and content. You may find that you actually need less!

"
9053,3 july 2017,scorpio,"Over the next week you may consider taking a chance of some kind, something that will take your life to a far more interesting place. Today is a good time to not only think about it, but to discuss it with someone close. If you feel the need for confidentiality, however, know that you can still receive “advice” of the cosmic kind. Tour intuition is strong, so use it.

"
9054,3 july 2016,scorpio,"The planets are pushing you out of the “same-old, same-old” lifestyle into something that’s more fun, creative and expansive. The next two weeks could be life-changing, as you’re being asked to overhaul all aspects of your existence to live more vibrantly. A jubilant Sun-Neptune trine today tells you to get some artistic mojo going. You don’t have to take art classes;  just make a commitment to spend more time with hobbies, buy some fresh flowers, and add more color to your place.

"
9055,4 july 2017,scorpio,"Confidence is sexy, and you’re going to end up in the perfect place this week to experience that. Today amorous Venus enters your house of libido and intimacy, and then on Wednesday Mercury glides into your house of authority and success. Gotta love this combination!

"
9056,4 july 2016,scorpio,"It’s time to take a chance on something that you’ve been considering for awhile, something that will help you grow as a person. Today’s new moon in the most progressive part of your chart will enable you to go after your dreams, and in a more creative manner than you’re used to!

"
9057,5 july 2017,scorpio,"With amorous Neptune retrograde in your romance sector, you may be having second thoughts about a romantic partner. This isn’t about leaving them, mind you–it’s more about figuring out the best way to get through to them. Perhaps you want more quality time, a baby or a ring. If you’re single you could be questioning the type of person you’ll connect with next. It’s all good, and it’s quite necessary.

"
9058,5 july 2016,scorpio,"A romantic relationship can turn over a new leaf with a positive Mercury-Neptune trine. It’s a good day to talk things over, especially if you’re getting ready to take things to the next level. Yesterday’s new moon should have you in an expansive state of mind, ready to grow.

"
9059,6 july 2017,scorpio,"There may be things that you have always wanted to do, but never had the guts to pursue. Well, now that the Sun and Mars are both in your adventure sector your confidence should be rising. A Jupiter-Sun square could bring up old fears, but wash them away like the morning tide. Your logical mind hasn’t disappeared; it will guide you in the right direction.

"
9060,6 july 2016,scorpio,"Your optimism should be going through the roof, courtesy of a fabulous Mars-Venus trine and the fiery Sun high-fiving Mercury. This is one of your best days all year to set passion projects in motion, whether it’s starting a family or kicking off a business idea that’s been rolling around in your head. But the planets tomorrow are in a difficult place, warning you not to discuss your ideas with others quite yet. You also need to pay close attention to the details. Just how are you going to achieve these goals?

"
9061,7 july 2017,scorpio,"Your ability to prioritize and accomplish important plans gets a boost from Venus, now in the most insightful part of your chart. The next few weeks are perfect for conducting research, lining up potential investors, figuring out financing and coming up with a smart strategy. This is true in your personal life as well as your private one, so cast a wide net.

"
9062,7 july 2016,scorpio,"Wings clipped? You may feel that way, as strong planetary forces oppose your optimistic spirit. Colleagues may not be in agreement about a work project, and bosses and clients may be picky. If you are planning any sort of major launch or enterprise—an advertising campaign, a wedding, putting together a proposal—you may get mired in red tape or details today. But this is beneficial, as it forces you to slow down and make sure that everything is perfect.

"
9063,8 july 2017,scorpio,"With tonight’s full moon in your house of self expression, now is a wonderful time to get your opinion or message out there. Talks with a lover should go just as well as a conversation with the boss or potential client. Your creativity should be off and running thanks to enriching Neptune in a helpful angle, making this a great time to pen a novel, rebrand your company, polish up your art portfolio or shamelessly promote your bad self.

"
9064,8 july 2016,scorpio,"Any venture that you undertake that uses technology should shimmer today, Scorpio! Whether you’ve decided to check out online dating sites, start a blog or design an app, your prospects for success are excellent. This vibe continues over the weekend and into Monday, so work with the energy on offer.

"
9065,9 july 2017,scorpio,"The recent full moon was in your house of self expression, and you may be raring to go: socializing with others, launching a media campaign, writing a book, teaching, negotiating deals, and creating artwork. But the planets warn that you need to take your time: make sure that your systems work, that employees or partners are doing their part, and that your message is on point.

"
9066,9 july 2016,scorpio,"No man is an island, as the saying goes, and the current planetary lineup suggests that teamwork is the way to go right now. A fortuitous meeting between promising Jupiter and the spontaneous Moon indicates that you could join forces with another, be it a romance, friendship, business venture or neighborhood association. With long-range Saturn in your security sector, this is an alliance that could stand the test of time.

"
9067,10 july 2017,scorpio,"It’s a “walking on eggshells” kind of a day, so be careful about what you say to others. Tough guy Pluto is active in your house of communication–a little too  active, I must say! You run the risk of appearing pushy or obnoxious, even if you’re trying to help someone. Step back and let this cosmic energy pass.

"
9068,10 july 2016,scorpio,"Wild horses can’t hold you back these days, Scorpio! With Mars in your sign you’re a force to be reckoned with. Your mind is in a good place, thanks to the fiery Sun and intelligent Mercury telling you to take more chances. A personal growth workshop or a seminar may be just what you need to learn new skills and develop fresh perspectives.

"
9069,11 july 2017,scorpio,"If you are seeking solutions or answers, look no further than yourself. Abundant Jupiter is active in your intuition sector, suggesting that you take some time today to meditate or quietly focus on what you need to do next.

"
9070,11 july 2016,scorpio,"Balancing act! That’s what you’re going to have to pull off as you charge forward with your plans. With Venus, Mercury and the Sun all in your high-flying ninth house, you may be ready to take on the world. But you can’t neglect the grunt work and the details that are involved. A tense Mercury-Uranus square could throw up a roadblock.

"
9071,12 july 2017,scorpio,"You got that mojo rising, Scorpio. Creativity gets a big boost thanks to the Moon entering your house of talent and skill development. Things may have been stuck for awhile, but now they can spring forward. Run your ideas past like-minded people, a smart idea considering that the recent full moon was in your house of synergy.

"
9072,12 july 2016,scorpio,"As the Sun advances toward the sign of Leo, you should be thinking about where you’re headed in your career. Your aspects for success are excellent, thanks to profitable Venus entering Leo today. This will give you a jump start when it comes to taking action that will lead to changes. Considering that Venus is the planet of ease and diplomacy, the old saying about catching more flies with honey than vinegar applies here. It gets better: quick-thinking Mercury goes into this part of the sky tomorrow, helping you self-promote, negotiate and impress.

"
9073,13 july 2017,scorpio,"Inspiration strikes today with a luscious Moon-Neptune aspect. These are two of the most passionate orbs in the solar system, so when they meet our minds can become full of possibilities. Don’t keep your thoughts to yourself either–share them, as the recent full moon’s energy is perfect for networking and growing closer to the people you care about the most.

"
9074,13 july 2016,scorpio,"If there was ever a time to promote your talents, Scorpio, this is it! Chatty Mercury is now in your house of ambition, joining lucky-bucks Venus. But you may want to consider a new way of reaching out to people, as transformative Pluto wants you to think out of the box. The full moon next week on the 19th is stellar for wrapping up a marketing plan, ad campaign, resume prep, or client presentation.

"
9075,14 july 2017,scorpio,"Sometimes the best way to get ahead in life is to keep your head down, stay out of the spotlight, don’t make a lot of noise and soldier your way forward. Leave bragging and one-upmanship to lesser mortals. Besides, surprising the hell out of them later on will be so  rewarding.

"
9076,14 july 2016,scorpio,"Pushy, pushy! Aggressive Mars has spent a good deal of time in Scorpio this year, lighting a fire in you to get things done. Problem is, not everyone is operating on your super-charged time frame. You may find that out today as unpredictable Uranus provokes someone, most likely a co-worker or client, to act out. Take it slow and listen to their point of view. Taking a “my way or the highway” attitude won’t work.

"
9077,15 july 2017,scorpio,"Inspiration strikes in a big way, so take your bright ideas and run with them. With the Moon in the most creative part of your chart, you can come up with all sorts of unique and artistic solutions. Once Mars and the Sun enter Leo next week there will be no stopping you.

"
9078,15 july 2016,scorpio,"Now that Venus and Mercury are in the most ambitious part of your chart, you’re no doubt thinking about your next move. A wonderful meetup between the Moon and Saturn today will help you get closer to your income goals. While bringing home more money is nice, so is loving what you do for a living. La Luna asks you to consider that as you focus on the green stuff.

"
9079,16 july 2017,scorpio,"A sudden burst of motivation will hit you to get moving with something, from a diet to a project that’s been sitting on your desk, and that’s a good thing. What’s not helpful is trying to blaze your way through it at warp speed, a possibility with aggressive Mars in a tough angle. Take your time.

"
9080,16 july 2016,scorpio,"Yowza! The planets are packing a powerful punch today, and it’s all in your favor. First, a Mercury-Venus meetup in your tenth house of ambition and career makes you the go-to guy or gal for the job. Then a beneficial trine between the fiery Sun and energetic Mars tells you to think beyond old boundaries and perceptions of yourself, and what you’re capable of. The sky’s the limit.

"
9081,17 july 2017,scorpio,"You may be over the moon about a goal, dream or project, but that’s the problem–your feet need to be firmly planted on the ground. If you don’t get real about this, someone else will be more than happy to point it out. Don’t give them the satisfaction.

"
9082,17 july 2016,scorpio,"Your aspects for career advancement are terrific this week as the Moon glides into your third house of negotiating, commerce and connections. A profitable angle between Uranus and La Luna today could bring an idea for expanding your client list or streamlining your office procedures. Not everyone in the company will be on board with your ideas, but you’re not going to care. Mercury and Venus in your authoritative tenth house will put you in charge.

"
9083,18 july 2017,scorpio,"This is one of the most soulful days of the month for you Scorpio, as Venus and Jupiter connect in the vibiest parts of your chart. Don’t be surprised if you start considering a meditation practice, studying Zen Buddhism or analyzing your dreams. It’s a cathartic energy, so release what’s no longer serving you.

"
9084,18 july 2016,scorpio,"Talk is cheap, as the saying goes, but not for you, Scorpio! With transformative Pluto in your communication sector forming a fabulous angle with the Moon, your ability to convey your thoughts leaps ahead. Tomorrow’s full moon falls in this part of the sky, opening up a brand new cycle in which you can talk the talk while you walk the walk.

"
9085,19 july 2017,scorpio,"Your career is about to heat up big time with the Sun and Mars both entering Leo within the next 72 hours. But you can get a jump start today thanks to a helpful aspect that links smart negotiator Mercury with long term Saturn. Let the wheeling and dealing begin.

"
9086,19 july 2016,scorpio,"A powerful full moon in your house of expression closes out a period in which you may have felt that your voice was not being heard. Now is the time to speak up, self promote, write that book or screenplay, blog, teach or counsel. With so much positive planetary energy in your career sector, the next week is superb for interviewing or making client presentations. Your coworkers may be miffed at your newfound eloquence and ability to present bold new ideas, but let ‘em stew.

"

But the cosmos dishes up a little appetizer today with a yummy Venus-Saturn trine. Start letting the world know how talented you are. Ask for the job, the raise, the promotion, the deal. Saturn is in your house of income, providing a powerful earnings boost to whatever you decide to undertake.

"
9089,21 july 2017,scorpio,"Too many chefs spoil the sauce, as they say, and so does nitpicking over every little aspect of creating it. You are either dealing with paralysis by too much analysis, or a group of people who desperately need one direction to follow, not ten. The key is to become focused without losing sight of one  big picture.

"
9090,21 july 2016,scorpio,"Something is going to happen today that will remind you that friends and family are a key part of your happiness.

"
9092,22 july 2016,scorpio,"Here’s the good news: the Sun has entered Leo, your tenth house of career advancement. You have four weeks to make progress with your ambitions. Now for the not-so-good news: unpredictable Uranus goes retro in your house of co-workers and work assignments on the 29th. This means that you’ll be dealing with flaky colleagues, employees and clients who will wimp out, drag their feet or be indecisive for several months. Keep your eye on the prize and work around them.

"
9093,23 july 2017,scorpio,"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines. The new moon in Leo is your green light to get moving with key goals. The problem is that erratic Uranus is acting up in your sector of organization and systems.

"
9095,24 july 2017,scorpio,"Practicality rules today, so don’t get caught up in wishful thinking or denial. If someone or something isn’t right for you, make a choice and then move on. The good news is that you can develop momentum quickly as you head off into the sunset.

So much so that you may be thinking of asking for more responsibility or moving on, courtesy of today’s optimistic Moon-Sun trine.

"
9097,25 july 2017,scorpio,"People around you may be full of advice, and you would be wise to heed it. Find a mentor or good friend whom you can bounce ideas off of. With Mercury now in your tech sector, online advice could also be helpful: webinars, podcasts or blog posts that cover the topics you’re interested in.

Pluto, the great transformer, is stationed in your communication sector, aiming to make you more persuasive, eloquent and respected.

"
9103,28 july 2017,scorpio,"Keep your lips sealed over the next 48 hours, especially if you’ve been working on something behind closed doors. The same holds true if you are privy to a secret or confidential information. Loose lips will sink ships–make sure you don’t go down like the Titanic.  

"
9104,28 july 2016,scorpio,"With enterprising Mars in Scorpio, you’re ready to rock and roll. But some tense aspects over the next few days may make you feel like you’re wading knee-deep through mud.

But when Mercury enters your house of dream achievement on Friday, it’s all systems go.

"
9105,29 july 2017,scorpio,"Anyone who has been giving you attitude lately either needs to be knocked down a few pegs, or you have to decide to ignore them. Both strategies have their advantages. You have so much planetary energy encouraging you to achieve that you can’t waste time on trolls.

"
9106,29 july 2016,scorpio,"Some people have finessed the art of burning a candle at both ends, but that’s not the best MO for you over the next five months. Nope, Uranus is now retro in your wellness sector which means that it’s time for some serious self-care: nutritious meals, plenty of sleep, vitamins, and sensible exercise (86 the idea of a triathlon if you’re not in shape). You’re going to need the stamina! Co-workers could slack, clients might be indecisive and red tape at the office could turn into a crimson tide. Just say “ohhmmmm.”

"
9107,30 july 2017,scorpio,"Taking care of wonky emotional situations becomes easier today with a pleasant Venus-Uranus aspect.

"
9110,31 july 2016,scorpio,"The devil is in the details. Don’t skip over them, as producing error-free work is crucial right now.

"
9111,1 august 2017,scorpio,"Feeling philosophical as you try to figure out which direction to head in? It’s not surprising with Venus now in your house of deep thinking.

Brilliant Uranus goes retrograde today in your efficiency sector, warning you to update your routines before things start to fall apart!

"
9116,3 august 2016,scorpio,"With yesterday’s new moon in your ambition sector, you’re more than ready to move ahead with career goals. But how?

"
9119,5 august 2017,scorpio,"Ready to have a happier home life and greater commitment? Not surprising with the upcoming eclipse in your house of contentment and stability.

"
9120,5 august 2016,scorpio,"With Venus entering your house of acquaintances today, it wouldn’t be surprising if you spent some time reflecting on the quality of your friendships. The emotional Moon is in a questioning mood, asking if certain alliances will stand the test of time. Even if someone has been in your life for decades, if you sense that they don’t have your best interests at heart, it may be time to move on.

"
9121,6 august 2017,scorpio,"Trying to hold a sane conversation with someone today could feel like pushing a two-ton boulder uphill, so why bother?

But a tense Mercury-Neptune opposition advises you to choose your companions wisely. Not everyone should make the cut. Make sure that you’re not hearing what you want to hear, especially from a romantic partner.

"
9125,8 august 2017,scorpio,"Emotional issues can be put out there on the table for discussion today. But don’t wait for someone else to make the first move; seize the reins and be the one who opens up the lines of communication. You might end up being surprised at how level-headed and objective you are. Let’s hope that others are the same way!

"
9126,8 august 2016,scorpio,"Be careful what you ask for–you might get it! That’s the message from the cosmos today. With the Moon in the house where we dig deep and seek answers, it’s a good time to consider what you really want out of life. You need to be true to yourself, and not worry about the opinions (and lifestyles) of your friends and family. Chiron, the wounded healer, is in a good angle, suggesting that once you realize what you’re seeking, as sense of relief will come over you.

"
9127,9 august 2017,scorpio,"With both the Sun and mighty Mars in your house of authority, you are definitely a force to be reckoned with. But the manner in which you get your point across needs to be switched up a bit. Maybe you need to come on stronger, or be more gentle.

"
9128,9 august 2016,scorpio,"Over the past few days you may have been wondering about whether some connections are worth it, Scorpio. It could be friends, a lover or a group you’re associated with, and your time–not to mention your serenity–should be protected.

"
9130,10 august 2016,scorpio,"When in doubt, talk it out. A terrific Mercury-Pluto trine encourages you to run your ideas and concerns past a trusted confidante or mentor today. Pluto is changing the way in which you process information and make decisions, which is a good thing, but it may have you second-guessing yourself. Reach out to someone whose good judgment you can rely on.

"
9131,11 august 2017,scorpio,"Behind the scenes business deals and confidential interviews are the order of the day. If you’re looking for a new job, this is a superb time to start making inquiries. Just don’t tell the entire free world of your plans.

"
9132,11 august 2016,scorpio,"As the Moon gets ready to glide out of Scorpio, it reminds you to get moving on an ambitious plan that you’ve had under consideration.

"
9133,12 august 2017,scorpio,"Egads–Mercury retrogrades today in your teamwork sector! Projects can get knocked off track as people disagree about who’s responsible for what, the creative aspect of the endeavor, the budget or the best way to get things done. This sector also governs technology, soooo…….back up your data, don’t post anything inappropriate online, and don’t expect website and social media launches to take off like a shot.

"
9134,12 august 2016,scorpio,"It may be Friday and your mind is on happy hour and the weekend ahead, but….Saturn goes direct tomorrow in your income sector! While that’s worth drinking to, it’s also wise to think about new income streams you can develop, asking for a raise or getting involved in a startup on the side. Your plans may have been stuck or even derailed over the past few months, maybe from undercapitalization, but that’s about to change.

"
9135,13 august 2017,scorpio,"Stepping into your own power becomes a heck of a lot easier with today’s magnificent Sun-Saturn trine, a cosmic event that will be felt for days. Feeling more in control will help you in all areas of your life, from love to money to your friendships. Just beware of becoming too vocal, a probability on Tuesday.

"
9136,13 august 2016,scorpio,"If you have felt stuck in a romantic relationship or a job over the past few months, good news–Saturn goes direct today. The ringed planet has been in your second house, the place of security, both financial and emotional. You may have felt hemmed in by a person or organization, as this is the house of rules and routines. Finally, progress can be made. Whether you stay or go is up to you, but don’t expect change overnight, as Saturn moves slowly on a good day!

"
9137,14 august 2017,scorpio,"With so much planetary activity taking place in your career and success sector, you may be neglecting something very important, and it’s called “fun”.

"
9138,14 august 2016,scorpio,"While being coy and playing flirty romantic games can seem like sexy fun, a Venus-Neptune opposition advises you to play it straight today and into early next week. Be direct and leave no room for interpretation. And if someone else is playing this game, they may be not be as serious about love as you think they are.

"
9139,15 august 2017,scorpio,"“Everyone is entitled to my opinion!” Someone–hopefully not you–is in that kind of mindset, and they won’t be afraid to be obnoxious. Remember, you can’t take words back once they’re out.

"
9140,15 august 2016,scorpio,"Going it alone right now isn’t the smartest plan! Indeed, the planets are urging you to team up with others in order to live a happier, more productive life. With the Moon and Pluto together in your house of communication, reach out to friends, neighbors, other parents, industry contacts or anyone else you can think of who can help smooth the path ahead. You can make some new friends and enjoy the trip a lot more.

"
9141,16 august 2017,scorpio,"Sometimes in matters of the heart ya just gotta take charge, and today is one of those days. Don’t let a lover (or even a child) make promises to you that they have no intention of keeping (“I’ll clean my room” or “I’ll leave my wife”). Let them know that there’s a new sheriff in town–nicely.

"
9142,16 august 2016,scorpio,"Feeling ambitious? You should be, considering that the fiery Sun is in your house of achievement and success. But what’s the best path to take in the days and weeks ahead? Answers to that question may appear today in a very spontaneous manner, as innovative Uranus is in a fine angle to the Sun. Why take the slow road when you can be in the fast lane?

"
9143,17 august 2017,scorpio,"Screech!!!! The brakes get slammed on a venture or plan of yours that was developing momentum. Fortunately this is just a bump in the road and will pass quickly.

"
9146,18 august 2016,scorpio,"Security increases in your financial affairs as a full moon in your sector of security and comfort takes place. With the Sun forming a harmonious trine to maverick Uranus, you could be at the receiving end of an offer to work someplace new, or to take on more responsibility where you currently work. Self-employed Scorpios could suddenly land a new client or deal that puts a smile on their face. But are your lover or kids peeved that you may be putting in longer hours? Make sure they don’t get left out in the cold.

"
9147,19 august 2016,scorpio,"With three celestial orbs at odds with each other today in the heavens, you may feel torn as to which task to attend to first. Mars and Saturn in your second house of routines are working to develop smarter, more efficient ways of getting things done. You have big plans for the future, but in order to achieve them you have to get down to the dirty details. Clarity will increase between now and next Wednesday.

"
9148,20 august 2016,scorpio,"With so many planets in your house of friends and camaraderie, you’ll be more than ready to meet up with pals for drinks, dinner or a party. But the Moon opposes the fun and games from your house of romance. Spending too much time with the boys (or girls) and not enough with your honey? Or maybe you’re simply finding it hard to balance your time with all the people you love, such as family and kids and a lover. You’ll be able to figure this out after Monday when the Sun enters Virgo.

"
9149,21 august 2016,scorpio,"Ready to hear that old cash register ring? I’ll bet you are, and with the Moon in entrepreneurial Aries, you might be super motivated to drum up a new source of income. One of the best days this year to state your case for a raise, look for a new job or research starting a business is this Wednesday. Start the planning now.

Get ready to run with it, as planetary aspects later in the week will support its success.

"
9151,23 august 2016,scorpio,"It’s time to get real about your finances, Scorpio, as Mars and Saturn are holding a summit conference on that topic tomorrow. But this is a good thing. Mars will give you the ambition to earn more while Saturn blesses you with the discipline to make new habits stick. Today’s Moon-Neptune angle tells you to focus first on expenditures that deal with children, entertainment, sports, hobbies and your spouse or lover. No one’s telling you to not enjoy life, however! Just make a realistic budget and stick to it.

"
9152,24 august 2016,scorpio,"A dazzling day in the cosmos! Power brokers Saturn and Mars meet up for an important convo in your income sector. It’s a superb time to impress others with your resume or a presentation. One caveat: don’t let anyone see that you’re anxious or hungry, a possibility with Mars involved. Also, think long-term, a must with Saturn on the case. Whatever you get started today can take you far.

"
9153,25 august 2016,scorpio,"Your earning power is on the rise, Scorpio, thanks to an auspicious Mars-Saturn hookup yesterday in the heavens. But don’t spend it before you make it! The Moon is stirring you up to pad your portfolio with more cash, but a tough angle between La Luna and the other two power brokers means that being fiscally conservative is the key. Others in your circle may be tempting you to spend, but maintain the long view and keep the plastic in your wallet.

"
9154,26 august 2016,scorpio,"Cue Diana Ross and the Supremes: “You can’t hurry love, no you just have to wait! Love don’t come easy, it’s a game of give and take.” Got that? Because if you try to pressure someone today chances are it will backfire. The problem is that murky Neptune is making a lover hard to pin down. It’s also possible that you  are on the receiving end of a demanding amour and you’re not willing to communicate. Let this pass and wait for better vibes on Monday.

"
9155,27 august 2016,scorpio,"A collaboration may be in the works, something that you may want to consider taking part in. Whether it’s an industry gig, a neighborhood association or just planning a vacation with your friends, it has success written all over it.

9156,28 august 2016,scorpio,"This could be an emotional day in love, but this is a good thing. A happy trine between the Moon and Chiron, the wounded healer, enables you to see beyond limiting thoughts from the past that may be holding you back in romance.

"
9157,29 august 2016,scorpio,"Choose your friends and associates wisely, Scorpio. Mercury is about to go retrograde in this part of your chart tomorrow. If you suspect that there’s a frenemy in your midst, you need to weed them out. Fortunately for you, magnetic Venus enters the house of the subconscious mind today, ramping up your intuition. Pull away a bit and observe before making decisions.

"
9158,30 august 2016,scorpio,"You’re already known for being a vibey, intense individual, but now that Venus is in your house of intuition you will become even more in tune with the unseen realms. Good thing, because Mercury retrogrades in your house of camaraderie and teamwork. If there are any faux friends or associates in your midst you’ll sniff them out faster than a police dog. This is also the house of tech projects, so there could be delays with a website launch, social media or developing an app. Take your time and do it right.

"

"
9163,4 september 2016,scorpio,"With structured Saturn trying to bring you long-term stability in all areas of your life, you’re going to want to associate with people who have your best interests at heart. Your intuition will be strong today as you ponder just whom you can count on and trust. This isn’t to say that you have enemies lurking in your midst. But sometimes it’s better to rely on a smaller, more tight-knit group than a great big posse.

"

Saturn is hell bent on trying to line you up with romantic and business alliances that will stand the test of time.

9165,6 september 2016,scorpio,"Networking with others is the way to go right now, thanks to a beneficial Moon-Sun-Pluto connection. It doesn’t matter if you’re trying to find new love or a new job, or just make friends with likeminded people. Just don’t push too hard, a possibility with Mars on the scene. You may be anxious for more security but you run the risk of turning people off if you come on too strong.

"
9166,7 september 2016,scorpio,"A sparkling trine between the Sun and Pluto will create a new dynamic in teams and groups that you’re associated with. You’re coming into a more powerful, respected position and your words have weight. It’s possible that decision makers have noticed your skills and are considering you for bigger and better things—with more money attached to them.

"
9167,8 september 2016,scorpio,"Two of the best words in the English language are “cash flow”, especially if the adjective “substantial” precedes them! You’re going to be highly energized to earn more money as the Moon connects with both ambitious Mars and disciplined Saturn in your income sector. Neptune, however, is kicking up a fuss in your house of entertainment and luxury, urging you to spend, spend, spend. Follow the more practical path.

"
9168,9 september 2016,scorpio,"Retreat, recover, release. These are the watchwords for you over the next 13 months as healing Jupiter has entered your twelfth house of introspection, closure and nurturing. Treating yourself with extreme self-care is what it’s all about. Rid yourself of bad habits and cut toxic ties. This is also a time for wrapping up projects that have already begun; however, if you want to kick off a new initiative, your imagination and creativity will be off the charts.

"
9169,10 september 2016,scorpio,"Neptune is the planet of fantasy, and it’s playing with your head today, Scorpio! Above all, you must be realistic in matters of the heart, especially when it comes to your security within a relationship. Which means: don’t assume that the married man you’re seeing is really going to leave his wife. Stop looking at wedding gowns when you’ve only been out on 3 dates. Having a baby isn’t going to heal a broken romance. If your logical mind is telling you that something is off, then it is.

"
9170,11 september 2016,scorpio,"Keep your antennae up today as someone may be more interested in their own needs than yours. Pluto, the planet that deals with power-hungry people, is at odds with Venus, creating a situation in which you need to protect your own interests. But the good news is that Venus is in your intuition sector, enabling you to figure out what’s going on behind the scenes.

"
9171,12 september 2016,scorpio,"The company you keep is the focus over the next few days, and with Mercury retrograde in your friendship sector you could hear from an old pal. But choose your acquaintances carefully, and that includes people you team up with at work and after hours: socializing, charity or volunteer work, in the neighborhood or your daily workout. Some connections may not be worth the trouble, especially if certain people expect you to play roles that simply aren’t in your interest.

"
9172,13 september 2016,scorpio,"Playing by the rules may not be as exciting as going off the grid, but the cosmos is warning you to keep to protocols and routines this week. The upcoming lunar eclipse on Friday is stirring you up, encouraging you to think on a grander scale. There’s nothing wrong with raising the bar and trying to achieve more, but you must back up your dreams with a solid plan.

"
9173,14 september 2016,scorpio,"Most of us are working for a living, but let’s face it, some jobs or occupations are more secure than others. And in your case, an auspicious Moon-Mars-Uranus angle could provide you with inspiration that will lead to a greater sense of safety. Maybe it’s a home-based business that you can run on the side, or a dazzling money-saving idea that you can pitch to the boss. If you’re self-employed or work on commission, you could streamline your operations. After all, time is money.

"
9174,15 september 2016,scorpio,"With tomorrow’s eclipse falling in your house of romance, you may be giving a lot of thought to love, whether you’re already committed to someone or just looking. With Mars burning a path through your house of security, you could be way too anxious to hear some kind of promise: a ring, a baby, or “this time I’m going to change, it will be different, I swear!” You want less drama and more of a routine, but pushing hard may backfire. Let the eclipse shine its light on your next move.

"
9175,16 september 2016,scorpio,"Matters of the heart are spotlighted by today’s lunar eclipse in your house of romance, fun, and children. Something big could be coming to an end, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing: your days of being alone and single, your years of being childless, your self-esteem being trampled by an unappreciative lover. If you’re happy in love, things can suddenly jump up to a higher level (wedding bells? renewing your vows?). But if you’re not, this lunation could be the last straw that pushes you into a much better place.

"
9176,17 september 2016,scorpio,"“Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.” This quote from Eleanor Roosevelt pretty much sums up your mindset today. Think about ideas, great ones, as assertive Mars trines the planet of genius, Uranus. Don’t be surprised if the people around you are uncomfortable when they hear what you have to say. You’re probably going to be way ahead of the pack, and it will take them time to realize that your ideas have merit.

"
9177,18 september 2016,scorpio,"Sometimes you just have to throw out the “Rule Book of Life” and make your own regulations! A Venus-Uranus opposition today might spur you suddenly to rethink how you go through your day. If you’re always dutifully taking care of this errand or that chore, it’s time to make some more time for you–and carve that in stone!

"
9178,19 september 2016,scorpio,"As an astrologer I’m always happy when I see planets in the secretive twelfth house signal planets in the income sector, because that means that hush-hush money talks can take place. That’s what you have on tap today as Venus and Mars hold a confidential meeting about your earnings. If you’re not already talking to someone, start now–about a raise, new job or how to start your own business.

"
9179,20 september 2016,scorpio,"If you’re involved in any kind of group effort—a charity, the PTO, an industry think tank, a team at the office—you may need to go back and rework a project that’s on the table. Likewise, the roles of the people involved and their duties may also need to be switched up. But this is all for the good as intelligent, chatty Mercury forms a trine with transformative Pluto. The positive energy continues into the weekend, so make the most of it.

"
9180,22 september 2016,scorpio,"Sshhh! The Sun enters Libra, the most secretive, hidden part of your chart, the house of the subconscious mind. But don’t think that this will be a quiet time. You can achieve a lot, and the best way to go about that is to pull away from the madding crowd and work alone as much as possible.  This is your best opportunity all year to break bad habits and negative thoughts patterns, as well as cutting toxic ties.

"
9181,23 september 2016,scorpio,"Fantasy vs. reality—balancing them is today’s challenge! A Moon-Jupiter square could place you firmly in Lala Land, daydreaming (or worrying)  about things that may have no basis in truth. Keep it real. There’s nothing wrong with having dreams, but if they spin out of control, so could you.

"
9182,24 september 2016,scorpio,"It’s a great day to hang with your friends or party with the tribe, courtesy of a happy Mercury-Pluto trine. Avoid the tendency though to spew out opinions that your pals may not be ready for. It’s also possible that you could be on the receiving end of unsolicited advice. Keep things light.

"
9183,25 september 2016,scorpio,"It’s time for a reboot of Scorpio 2.0. Magnetic Venus is now in your sign, which is perfect for a makeover. A fresh new attitude would go along well with some stylin’ new clothes and hair. The Sun and Jupiter are urging you to toss outdated versions of yourself in the garbage, along with the crummy feelings surrounding things that didn’t work out. Next!

"
9184,26 september 2016,scorpio,"Sometimes closure can be painful and other times it can be as smooth as silk. The latter holds true today as the Sun and optimistic, healing Jupiter meet in your twelfth house of letting go. This annual meeting is considered to be one of the best moments of the year, so use it to your advantage. Dump bad habits, see a therapist if need be about past hurts or substance abuse, and consider leaving toxic arrangements that are sucking the life out of you. Clearing out the dead wood allows inspiration to flow in, and the next 12 months could see your talents go through the roof.

"
9185,27 september 2016,scorpio,"Curb your enthusiasm! Now that dynamic Mars is in your chatty third house of self-expression, you can push forth with studies, writing projects, socializing, and self-promotion. But watch the tendency to come on too strong, a possibility with Mars and dynamic Pluto in this part of your chart. Go after these projects with zeal; just remember that not everyone will share your eagerness or intensity.

"
9186,28 september 2016,scorpio,"A happy Moon-Mercury angle in your house of friends and networking is encouraging you to connect with as many people as possible these days, whether it’s for work or pleasure. Today is great for reaching out and making plans. But there could be some dissension coming from a lover who feels neglected, or kids who want you to log some quality time with them. Likewise, make sure that you’re not spending all your time with business cronies–you need some time for you.

"
9187,29 september 2016,scorpio,"A group or team effort may need to be adjusted, and quickly at that. A meeting between the Moon and spontaneous Uranus indicates that roles, protocols or future plans should be examined and changed if need be. You might also want to take a look at your personal goals, as it seems that you should alter your approach to achieving them.

"
9188,30 september 2016,scorpio,"With so much planetary energy in your hush-hush twelfth house, you may be wondering if you’re going to ever be in the spotlight. Well, you should be this weekend, as a terrific Venus-Neptune trine occurs. Venus is in Scorpio, making you look like the hottest thing on two legs, and Neptune is in your house of romance. Plan a sexy date night out on the town! Singles, make sure you circulate—and you’re not sporting dirty hair or some shapeless schmatta.

"
9189,1 october 2016,scorpio,"Hmmm…got a secret crush on someone? Or perhaps someone is lusting after you without your knowledge. A new moon in your hush-hush twelfth house today is accompanied by a meeting of the two most romantic planets in our solar system, Venus and Neptune. Matters of the heart could be simmering sexily behind closed doors. Likewise, over the next few months you could be involved in a number of activities that you’re keeping quiet, such as sourcing a new job or moving to a new location.

"
9190,2 october 2016,scorpio,"You may feel pressured to make a decision about something but it appears that you don’t have all the facts yet. Take off any rose colored glasses you may be wearing, get real, and then determine the most efficient or practical way to proceed. Listen to your own wisdom than the advice of friends or a romantic partner, as you know what’s best.

"
9191,3 october 2016,scorpio,"With charismatic Venus in your sign you can sweet talk people in ways that may not have been possible earlier this year. The issue is that A Venus-Pluto link could encourage you to take things a little too far, using manipulation or trying to turn things to your advantage. It’s best to be straightforward, as subterfuge could backfire as early as this Thursday.

"
9192,4 october 2016,scorpio,"Getting to the bottom of an issue should be much easier these days, thanks to smooth-sailing Venus in your sign and the Sun in your house of intuition. Today you may be questioning your security, be it in romance, your career, or just your overall sense of certainty. Both your sixth sense and logical mind can help you immensely.

"
9193,5 october 2016,scorpio,"With Venus in your sign you should be feeling open and at ease with how you present yourself. But over the next few days you may reconsider what you say and how you say it, as planets in your intuitive twelfth house warn you to keep your opinions (and psychic hits) to yourself. Today is still favorable for being candid with a happy Venus-Pluto aspect, but once Thursday rolls around it’s better to be discrete.

"
9194,6 october 2016,scorpio,"When in doubt, check it out! Your brain could be sending you mixed signals today, with your intuition telling you one thing and your rational mind saying something completely different. Don’t make any big decisions under this aspect, which will continue tomorrow and resurface again before the 15th. If you must bring something to a conclusion before then, do what Ben Franklin did: the old pro and con list.

"
9195,7 october 2016,scorpio,"You’ve been in a pretty vibey place over the past few weeks thanks to hosting the Sun and Jupiter in this part of your chart. Today energetic little Mercury joins them, helping your sixth sense operate at warp speed. The only problem here is that you may start reading too much into everything, searching our subtle nuances when there are none to be found. Also, with brash Mars in your house of communication, you run the risk of blabbing every thought that comes into your head. Filter, please!

"
9196,8 october 2016,scorpio,"My, my, aren’t we chatty! With the Moon, Mars and Pluto all piled into your communication sector no one could blame you for being a social butterfly this weekend. With magnetic Venus in your sign, you’ll have no trouble finding pals and admirers who’d like to spend time with you. Amorous Neptune is in a gorgeous angle from your romance zone, so your biggest problem is going to be deciding who you’re going to spend your time with!

"
9197,9 october 2016,scorpio,"You’re in an excellent position to self-promote, one of the best times in years as a matter of fact. With Venus in Scorpio and Mars and Pluto in your house of writing, lecturing, drawing, and socializing, you should be getting your message out there to the world. Just don’t expect everyone to be as excited as you are, especially when it comes to co-workers or employees. Someone may try to throw a monkey wrench into your plans, so stay on your toes.

"
9198,10 october 2016,scorpio,"No more settling for table scraps! A cleansing Venus-Chiron aspect tells you that you no longer have to settle for less in life. It’s not your karma to put up with toxic people or be involved in an unhappy relationship. Getting up and going to a soul-sucking job every day isn’t part of some cosmic master plan. With Venus in Scorpio, you should be considering other possibilities–and they should be better ones.

"
9199,11 october 2016,scorpio,"Many people, if asked if they would rather have peace of mind over money, will choose the former. After all, what use is money if you’re ravaged by fears, doubts and anger? Scorpio, you’re in luck today as a happy meeting between Mercury and Jupiter in the house of your subconscious mind opens the doors to peace. The doors to the higher mind will open too, bringing you wisdom from the cosmos, along with an amazing burst of inspiration. Take this gift and run with it.

"
9200,12 october 2016,scorpio,"Tiptoe around others in the week ahead, and keep your opinions to yourself! A filter will  be needed as your intuition is in top form, helping you analyze situations with incredible quality. But that doesn’t mean that the people around you want to hear the unvarnished truth. Let them figure things out for themselves instead.

"
9201,13 october 2016,scorpio,"You could be privy to a secret….or perhaps you have you own! Either way, the planets warn you to keep them to yourself as a “loose lips sinks ships” vibe is prevalent in the cosmos. This is especially true in the workplace, as a number of planets are active in your earnings and colleagues sectors. If you’re looking for a new job keep that juicy piece of information to yourself.

"
9202,14 october 2016,scorpio,"If you’ve been thinking about getting rid of some habits that are not exactly helping you on your journey, now’s a good time to toss ’em. Candid Mercury is in the house of the subconscious mind, telling you to get real–and to get moving by replacing them with smarter routines and alternatives. Better yet is that Saturn, planet of discipline and long term success, is in an auspicious angle as well.

"
9203,15 october 2016,scorpio,"Finish what you’ve started, Scorpio! Some tense angles today in the cosmos demand that you put an end to anything that’s been dragging on for far too long: your divorce, term paper, bad habit, cluttered closets or negative thought patterns. Do what it takes to clear out the detritus from your life, which may mean having some serious conversations with others—or yourself. A supermoon tomorrow in your efficiency sector can help you blast through these things like a hot knife through butter.

"
9204,16 october 2016,scorpio,"Ready to make progress? If that’s the case today’s full moon in Aries has your name written all over it. You may decide to hire someone to help you with your tasks, such as a nanny or house cleaner. Or you may decide to hire a new employee at work, contract out tasks to an outside source, or streamline your routine. Efficiency is the name of the game here. You could become so motivated that you also decide to get fit through a diet and exercise regimen.

"
9205,17 october 2016,scorpio,"Yesterday’s full moon in Aries should be firing you up to become more efficient and healthy, but old habits die hard. With the Sun in your habit zone, you may be putting up resistance to making changes. Or maybe you’re telling yourself that certain things (like a diet) didn’t work out before…so why bother? This time they will. With structured Saturn in a terrific spot, sticking to new routines should be much easier than expected.

"
9206,18 october 2016,scorpio,"The planets are aligning to put more money in your pocket, always a bonus! The recent full moon in Aries was all about blasting through your work, becoming more productive and landing new clients and assignments. And today profitable Venus enters your income sector for a few weeks, so you’re in the perfect spot to make headway. Start shopping your resume, talk to the boss about a raise, and create a workable budget.

"
9207,19 october 2016,scorpio,"Keep those famous scorpionic barbs under control today! A high wattage meet up between Mars and Pluto could impel you to speak your mind, which isn’t necessarily a problem as long as you’re diplomatic. Problem is, Mars isn’t exactly the planet of diplomacy, and Pluto is all about demonstrating personal power. As a result you could come across as overbearing under this influence. But if played right, you can also appear to be dynamic, self-assured, intelligent and well-spoken. The choice is yours.

"
9208,20 october 2016,scorpio,"Something could happen today that will make you realize that you have some “inner work” to do. Maybe it’s a comment from someone. Maybe it’s an old unhappy memory that keeps playing like a tape on a repeating loop in your head. Whatever it is, consider it as a gift from the cosmos, even if it brings up uncomfortable feelings. Of all the signs you’re in the best place to get your s*** together mentally.

"
9209,21 october 2016,scorpio,"Frustration with your daily routine could mount today with a Moon-Mars-Pluto opposition. You may long to get away from mundane details and the “little stuff” in order to focus on the big stuff. But duty calls, and it’s wise to take care of projects that are in front of you rather than jump into new endeavors. Overwhelm will catch up with you pretty quickly otherwise.

"
9210,22 october 2016,scorpio,"Yee-ha! Your big bad birthday season is officially here, Scorpio! And it falls on a Saturday, so why not get the party started this weekend? A side bonus is the entry of Mercury into the same part of the sky on Monday, perfect for polishing up your speaking skills and overall self-image. People will want to hear what you have to say, so make sure that you look and act the part of a winner. It gets even better around the 30th, when a glorious new moon occurs in Scorpio. Love planet Venus is huddled nearby, suggesting that some amorous times are ahead.

"
9211,23 october 2016,scorpio,"You might be scratching your head over a remark made by a lover or child today, as confusing Neptune is active. But the watery planet forms a good angle to optimistic Jupiter, indicating that you can get to the bottom of the matter—without screaming and a lot of drama! Mighty Jupiter happens to be in your house of intuition, so your gut hunches could be right on target. Use it to figure out what’s going on.

"
9212,24 october 2016,scorpio,"Birthday season gets even brighter as Mercury joins the Sun today in your sign! The next few weeks are excellent for self-expression—the way you dress, the image you project, what you have to say, impressing others with your ideas and enjoying your creative side. A stellar day for dazzling others is Thursday when the Sun and Mercury form a conjunction in the heavens. Shine on!

"
9213,25 october 2016,scorpio,"Just what do you want, really? In love, your family life and even your lifestyle? Today’s planetary aspects will produce a tug of war in which the need to grow and expand will come up against the desire to remain in a comfortable little box. There’s nothing wrong with wanting security as long as it doesn’t suffocate you. Neptune, planet of inspiration, is quite active today, pushing you to think and live creatively, but Venus is holding you back. This vibe soon passes—so take a little risk if a big one scares you!

"
9214,26 october 2016,scorpio,"Money matters get a boost today with a hush-hush Jupiter-Venus aspect. These are the two planets that govern profits, so the fact that they’re winking at each other across the heavens is a good sign. Know that lucky Jupiter is in your house of confidentiality, so if you’re hunting down a new job keep it quiet. The same goes for heading the entrepreneurial route. Tomorrow is an excellent day for brainstorming.

"
9215,27 october 2016,scorpio,"The cosmos delivers a nice birthday gift in your lap today: a conjunction of the Sun and Mercury in your sign. This means that these two form a perfect line in the heavens, blending their energies. With the Sun providing you with insight and authority, and Mercury stimulating your intellect, you’re in the perfect position to step into your own power and claim it. Better yet, others will see you as someone that want to date, marry, hire, befriend and collaborate with. As Mercury is the planet of expression, make sure to get your message across: verbally, in writing, any artwork you’ve produced and also your self-image.

"
9216,28 october 2016,scorpio,"A healing vibe in the cosmos helps you move past feelings of unworthiness in love. Likewise, you don’t have to play the role of enabler, or put up with situations that aren’t the best. Chiron, the wounded healer, allows you to vent your emotions, whether it’s to your lover or a trusted friend. This is also an auspicious time for opening up the lines of communication with a child, letting them know that they have to take on some responsibility.

"
9217,29 october 2016,scorpio,"Something may come out of left field today that will throw you off guard, perhaps putting a monkey wrench in your plans. It could also be a remark or attitude from someone that you don’t quite appreciate. But the good news is that a serene Venus-Saturn angle will help keep you grounded. And with tomorrow’s new moon in Scorpio, you’ll become even more focused on your own thoughts and contentment.

"
9218,30 october 2016,scorpio,"Happy birthday Scorpio! Today brings a happy event–the annual new moon in your sign. Use this lunation any which way you please to inaugurate positive changes in your life over the next twelve months. The energy of a new moon is strongest two weeks afterward, but continues on for about six months. Craving more love and romance? Then you’ll be pleased to know that the two most amorous planets, Venus and Neptune, are in fabulous angles to the moon. Get out there and circulate, because a hot prospect could be right around the corner.

"
9219,31 october 2016,scorpio,"With the moon swinging past the Sun and Mercury in you sign today, you may be highly motivated to go after something (or someone!) that makes your heart sing. Your creativity is off the charts these days, as well as your desire for love and affection, so reach out and grab that brass ring.

"
9220,1 november 2016,scorpio,"The recent new moon in your sign frees you up to follow your heart, pursuing passions and dreams that may have only recently seemed like a fantasy. You’re in an enviable spot when it comes to inspiration, considering that enriching and expansive Neptune is in your house of imagination. Today the Sun forms a harmonious angle with the watery planet, allowing you to really get clear about the details of your goals and aspirations. Grab a pad of paper and brainstorm away.

"
9221,2 november 2016,scorpio,"Keep a lid on major things that you’re working on at the present moment. With the Sun in your house of ambition, no doubt you’re tackling some of your most cherished goals and dreams. But that doesn’t mean that everyone needs to be in the loop; as a matter of fact, they shouldn’t be. Power broker Pluto in your confidentiality sector tells you that true strength comes from discretion. Keep some nuggets of information to yourself.

"
9222,3 november 2016,scorpio,"You’re an idea factory as of late, Scorpio, and this is a good thing! But don’t ignore the input and opinions of other people as they could provide a fresh look at a situation. As a matter of fact, finding a mentor, teacher or savvy expert right now could be just the ticket to making progress. This vibe repeats itself on Monday of next week, so start putting out your feelers now.

"
9223,4 november 2016,scorpio,"Your self-confidence should be rising along with your desire to achieve some new goals, thanks to hosting several planets in the house of you—Scorpio. But keep an eye on those around you who may want to hitch their wagon to your star, or those who may try to talk you out of your plan of action. You don’t need anyone’s approval or advice unless you seek it yourself, and from a qualified mentor at that.

"
9224,5 november 2016,scorpio,"Keep your schedule flexible this weekend as erratic Uranus may throw a few curveballs your way. Unexpected errands and last minute changes are on the planets’ agenda. But some of these events could hold a silver lining as they may open your eyes to new ways of scheduling your chores and getting the grunt work done.

"
9225,6 november 2016,scorpio,"Throw caution to the wind and take a chance! Maverick Uranus is telling you to break out of your usual routine and try something new. You may feel that your stuck in a particular schedule–the hours at the job, chauffeuring kids around and getting your errands done on the weekend–but you have some degree of control over your free time. Schedule in some quality time, just for you.

"
9226,7 november 2016,scorpio,"Excellent day to get your point across with authority and eloquence! The Sun is spotlighting your ideas, desires and image, so don’t hold back when it comes to expressing yourself. Put the finishing touches on proposals, contracts, manuscripts, written assignments and artwork before Mars leaves Capricorn on Wednesday.

"
9227,8 november 2016,scorpio,"It seems that you need to take control over the less glamorous things in life, such as getting the food shopping done, balancing your checkbook and getting caught up on your e-mails. Do so now, otherwise you may be facing a mountain of chores over the next five weeks. A clean house is a serene house, and the less clutter you see on a daily basis the calmer your mind will be.

"
9228,9 november 2016,scorpio,"With a full moon next week in your commitment sector, things may be reaching critical mass in a romantic or business partnership. You are craving security as Mars just entered your fourth house of contentment. If you’re not sure where you stand, chances are you’ll be demanding answers, but you won’t have to resort to heavy handed tactics. Silky smooth Venus will put the right words in your mouth once it glides into Capricorn on Friday.

"
9229,10 november 2016,scorpio,"Home is where the heart is, and it should also be the place where you can pamper yourself and indulge in your favorite activities. A Moon-Neptune connection recommends creating a home “art studio” or basement workshop where you and your loved ones can spend time on hobbies that soothe your soul. While you’re at it, go the spa route in your bathroom with some delicious smelling candles and bath potions.

"
9230,11 november 2016,scorpio,"You may feel compelled to speak your mind openly, courtesy of easy going Venus now in your house of reaching out and connecting. But a difficult Moon-Jupiter aspect today warns to keep your opinions to yourself. Confidentiality is the name of the game over the next few days. The end of next week is far better for getting your opinions heard.

"
9231,12 november 2016,scorpio,"It’s time to put some of your ideas to the test, Scorpio! Intelligent Mercury has just entered your income sector, so if you have some money or time saving ideas, by all means put them into motion. With smooth-as-silk Venus in your chatty house of relating to others, you’ll have no trouble when it comes to making a pitch or closing the deal.

"
9232,13 november 2016,scorpio,"Now that Mercury is in your house of earning more cash, you should be focusing on saving some dinero for home related purchases. Whether it’s simply splurging on some new pillows and bedding or socking away a large lump sum for a down payment on a house, make preservation of capital your #1 goal.

"
9233,14 november 2016,scorpio,"Things could be reaching critical mass in a romance as a full moon/super moon occurs in your house of relationships. The same holds true for close business alliances, whether it’s a standard partnership or someone who’s on retainer to represent your interests. You and a lover may not be in agreement as to what you want out of life and there could be “creative differences” in work situations. With easy going Venus in your communication sector, however, you have the opportunity to discuss matters and smooth them over.

"
9234,15 november 2016,scorpio,"Emotional and financial security are quite important to you and have been over the past year, thanks to hosting serious Saturn in your safety sector. You can make terrific progress today with developing both, but the key is to keep a realistic mindset. Don’t give in to flattery, vague promises or rose colored glasses kind of thinking. You need to be the captain of the ship.

"
9235,16 november 2016,scorpio,"A sudden burst of energy can be all you need to start moving on a project, whether it’s redecorating the bedroom or kicking the smoking habit. With so many planets in a practical, can-do mood, you can make a lot of progress. But the best part is that your sense of serenity and emotional contentment will rise along with the completion of your goals. Get moving!

"
9236,17 november 2016,scorpio,"Confusion may reign at the office as a number of planets are sending mixed signals. Employees may be difficult to corral; co-workers may need more direction, and it seems that you’re the one who may have to take charge. Be careful what you say and how you say it as there could be someone working against you behind the scenes. Next week is a far better time to be vocal and get your point across more strongly.

"
9237,18 november 2016,scorpio,"Watch the temptation to push a lover for a decision today, a possible scenario with an ornery aspect involving Neptune. Passive-aggressive tactics won’t work, so don’t even go there. With Mercury in your house of security you need answers to be sure, but this is not the time. Wait until next week when the Sun enters Sagittarius, at which time you’ll have more clout.

"
9238,19 november 2016,scorpio,"You’re in a bit of a flux, Scorpio. On the one hand you want excitement and fun; on the other you want stability. It’s not impossible to have both and with Neptune resuming direct motion today, you can. This is especially true in matters of the heart, and with a stellar Venus-Neptune aspect you should be reaching out to your amour to discuss some juicy future plans. No lover in sight? Then start socializing locally this weekend as it’s an awesome time to meet someone new.

"
9239,20 november 2016,scorpio,"As the Sun prepares to leave your sign tomorrow, spend some time reflecting on where you’re headed next. A wonderful Moon-Uranus trine today could provide sparks of inspiration. Consider talking to a coach or mentor in the days ahead if you need guidance. Likewise, what skills do you need to develop or polish up in order to achieve the things that are closest to your heart?

"
9240,21 november 2016,scorpio,"Pluto, the planet of metamorphosis, is actively changing the way you think, talk and express yourself in writing and other creative methods. And now that the Sun is in your income zone, this is a honey of a time to start viewing yourself–and your earning power–in a completely different light. Instead of just searching for the next promotion, job or deep-pocketed client to boost your income, why not focus on how you can be innovative instead? Standing out from the crowd can pay off far more handsomely.

"
9241,22 november 2016,scorpio,"Sometimes it’s wise to take a step back from projects that you’re working on in order to take a quiet assessment, and today is one of those days. With lucky Jupiter in the house of inspiration and the mind, your ability to consider what needs to be done next is heightened. Perhaps you simply need to switch up your habits and routines. Maybe you need more money, or the help of an influential person. Whatever it is, take action, but wait until next week. The new moon on the 29th is custom made for initiating changes.

"
9242,23 november 2016,scorpio,"As the holidays approach many people throw caution to the wind as they spend, spend, spend, but not you, Scorpio. A stern meeting today between rational Saturn and intelligent Mercury is all about being fiscally responsible, not only now but in the year ahead. This is an excellent time to review your spending habits, budgets and goals, both at home and at work. If you own a business it’s critical that you know where the money is going—and where the revenues will be coming from.

"
9243,24 november 2016,scorpio,"The holidays are here, but are you ready for socializing? A Pluto-Jupiter square today indicates that you may only be in the mood for small groups or people who really put a smile on your face. And that’s OK. Life is too short to spend it with people who are difficult. So if you have to spend time with folks who aren’t your type, a Jupiter-Pluto aspect suggests that you keep your opinions to yourself and just chill.

"
9244,25 november 2016,scorpio,"If it’s been difficult for you to say what’s on your mind lately, the cosmos will assist you today. Jupiter, the great benefic, is in the house of your deepest thoughts, encouraging you to release pent up emotions so that you can heal and move on. But a tense aspect with Pluto may have made you reluctant to speak out. Venus comes to your aid now, allowing you to vent. Let it flow.

"
9245,26 november 2016,scorpio,"Money talks, and it’s shouting at you today Scorpio! A super Mercury-Uranus trine can get your creative juices flowing, enabling you to brainstorm ways to earn more. A former boss or colleague could call you with a job offer, or you could figure out ways to land more clients or revenues. Get ready for a busy time ahead in which you can make loads of progress.

"
9246,27 november 2016,scorpio,"Whose life is it, anyway? You may need to draw a line in the sand with family members, household chores or extracurricular activities that are taking up too much of your quality time. That’s because your mind is filled to capacity with thoughts that don’t allow in fresh new ideas. Make a commitment to book time just for enjoying life.

"
9247,28 november 2016,scorpio,"Partnership talks can take a more serious turn this week as Tuesday’s new moon falls in your house of security. This lunation can also boost your feelings of self-worth, whether you’re involved with someone or not, so get ready to feel better about your bad self. Confidence is sexy, and everyone wants to be around a winner.

"
9248,29 november 2016,scorpio,"A new moon in your earnings sector is perfect for developing a new income stream, finding a higher paying job or creating a workable budget. With Saturn in an excellent angle, whatever you set in motion now can bring in cash for decades to come. Abundant Jupiter is also helpful, blessing you with inspiration for profitable ideas. But don’t spend it before you make it, and make it clear to the people around you that you’re not a money tree. You also have to overcome the desire to spend on unnecessary items that are “must haves”. Sorry, but luxury spending is going to have to wait awhile.

"
9249,30 november 2016,scorpio,"Inspirational Neptune has set up shop in the house that deals with your skills and talent, which is always helpful. But today the watery planet faces off against the practical Sun. The message? Sometimes it’s not enough to have flashes of brilliance. Even the most talented surgeons, musicians, public speakers and teachers take classes to further develop their abilities. And so should you. Seek out a mentor, read a book, attend a seminar or sign up for a class. No one is perfect.

"
9250,1 december 2016,scorpio,"A sweet sense of calm can wash over you as Jupiter and Mars trine each other in the heavens. If you have been doing a lot of “personal work”—trying to break a habit, becoming more mindful, releasing the negativity from past dramas—today can bring about a much desired breakthrough. And with chatty Mercury entering your house of expression on Friday, it’s time to let others know how you feel and what you think.

"
9251,2 december 2016,scorpio,"You’re an idea factory these days, Scorpio, thanks to hosting Pluto and Venus in your house of thinking and self-expression. Get ready for your brain waves to hum along at an even faster clip now that intelligent Mercury enters this house today. This aspect is also good for socializing, neighborhood affairs, going back to school, blogging or writing. Brainstorm now, then go over your ideas with a magnifying glass after the 19th when Mercury goes retrograde.

"
9252,3 december 2016,scorpio,"Relationships with family members can improve dramatically in the weeks ahead. With Mercury in the house that deals with siblings, and Mars in the sector that governs your parents and kids, now’s the time for healing rifts. When Venus enters Aquarius next Wednesday it should be even easier. But today you need to let loved ones know that you do have expectations about getting chores done. While you’re at it, remind them that money doesn’t grow on trees.

"
9253,4 december 2016,scorpio,"Your serenity and sense of contentment are becoming more important to you these days, and that’s a good thing. With so many planets active in your family, work and love sectors, you could be busier than a one-legged man in a butt kicking contest. Today a healing aspect encourages you to come up with ways to defuse and chill, whether it’s via meditation, scheduling more down time for yourself or sharing your thoughts with people who can help you find peace.

"
9254,5 december 2016,scorpio,"Getting along with co-workers is not always an easy task, but planetary aspects this week indicate that a surprising turn of events may take place. Maybe the office diva leaves the company; perhaps the boss finally straightens out people who need to be dressed down. But it could also be a slight change of attitude on your part that will will help reframe the situation so that you don’t care as much!

"
9255,6 december 2016,scorpio,"You may be in the mood for some down time, sequestering yourself away in your own little cocoon. And there’s nothing wrong with that, except that cosmic activity indicates that others may need your participation or help. Now. This theme reappears several times between now and Christmas, so be prepared to cooperate. However, you will get the chance to chill as Venus enters your warm and fuzzy house of domesticity tomorrow.

"
9256,7 december 2016,scorpio,"Some people crave comfort more than others, and now that luxe Venus is in your house of domesticity and emotional contentment, you’ll be looking for serenity! But in order to find it, practical matters often need to be addressed. Like: the piles of papers on your desk, the messy closets, family members constantly bickering and your own negative emotions. Next week’s full moon could bring up the latter, so get ready to deal with your demons. However, once exorcised, you can experience more peace.

"
9257,8 december 2016,scorpio,"Maintaining your freedom and individuality within a romantic relationship may be on your mind these days, as erratic Uranus is active in your partnership sector. This is a two-sided coin. On the one hand, you may feel stifled and in need of a lot more space. On the other, you might find that your romance is more exciting if you have the independence to pursue some passion projects of your own. Strike the right balance.

"
9258,9 december 2016,scorpio,"Habits make the man, they say, and they also make the woman! With optimistic Jupiter in the part of your chart that helps you break bad habits (and thought patterns) and replace them with new ones, this is the perfect time to make changes. You’ll be glad you did after the 29th when Uranus goes direct, and your daily grind becomes a heck of a lot busier.

"
9259,10 december 2016,scorpio,"The state of your financial health is paramount these days, as the cosmos will be focusing on money matters. You need to get real about your saving and spending habits due to a stern meeting today between the Sun and Saturn. If you need to develop better habits, the good news is that Saturn is all about discipline and the long term. Next week’s full moon also is in a fiscal part of your chart, helping you develop a stronger bottom line. Examine your budget and expenses now for problem areas that can be fixed.

"
9260,11 december 2016,scorpio,"Let bygones be bygones in your closest relationships, Scorpio. Some battles are simply not worth keeping alive. Better yet, think about the way you communicate with others and ask yourself, honestly, if you should switch up your methods. A helpful Moon aspect will help you repair alliances with the people you love the most.

"
9261,12 december 2016,scorpio,"Planetary influences indicate that you’d like to spend more time with loved ones, not to mention all by yourself. But in order to do that you first need to take care of practical matters, such as household chores and work at the office. Today you might hit upon a smart time and effort-saving idea that will streamline your daily grind. Put it into action now, as tomorrow’s full moon in the most intimate, passionate part of your chart wants you to enjoy more of the sweeter side of life.

"
9262,13 december 2016,scorpio,"Come on baby, light my fire! So sang Jim Morrison, and that’s your theme song for tonight’s full moon in Gemini. This is the lustiest part of your chart so get ready for the passion to flow. But it won’t just be about a hot night in the boudoir–this lunation indicates that decisions will be made, such as getting engaged or deciding to move things up a notch. Singles may decide that they’re done  with being alone, and unhappily attached Scorpios may move on. With dynamic Mars heading into your romance sector next week, this should be one memorable holiday season.

"
9263,14 december 2016,scorpio,"Your financial future is heating up, thanks to yesterday’s full moon in your house of fiscal responsibility. But keep your cards close to your vest, as my Grandma used to say, because you run the risk of giving away information that you shouldn’t. Like: a job hunt you’ve just started, a potential joint venture, trying to close that big client or pursuing your ex for past child support. With Mercury about to go retrograde (in your communication sector, no less) it’s imperative to say as little as possible.

"
9264,15 december 2016,scorpio,"Biting your tongue is going to become your specialty over the next few weeks, courtesy of Mercury retrograding next Monday. But you still have to be careful today, as a tense four-way square in the heavens indicates that a co-worker or client could act out. Expressing your opinion will only make matters worse, as the other party may misconstrue your words and intention. This passes quickly though, and Friday is actually a good time to communicate with these folks.

"
9265,17 december 2017,scorpio,"Give it a rest, Scorpio! You may be tempted to spend the weekend working, but the planets indicate that you should really take it easy. Besides, with energetic Mars entering your house of fun and romance on Monday for the first time in two years, you should be creating a bucket list of the exciting adventures you’d like to have in 2017. The chores can wait.

"
9266,17 december 2016,scorpio,"With the Moon in creative Leo you may dive into work projects with a renewed sense of vigor and passion! The upside to this is that you may discover a smarter, more efficient way of getting things done. With structured Saturn in your house of solid habits and routines, you can make enormous headway if you pay attention to the methods you use to get things done. You have plenty of skills—learn how to use them the right way.

"
9267,18 december 2016,scorpio,"Resist the urge to bail people out of their difficulties. While your heart may be in the right place, your friends and loved ones sometimes need to figure out their own path in life. Your attempts to help may even be taken the wrong way, especially after Mercury goes retrograde tomorrow until early January.

"
9268,19 december 2016,scorpio,"Discretion is the greater part of valor, a saying that you will need to repeat to yourself over and over again in the weeks ahead. That’s because Mercury retrogrades today in your house of communication (ouch!). If you think it, do you need to say it? Is is necessary to vent loudly on social media or via text and e-mail? Be careful with self expression, especially in romance. Aggressive Mars has just entered your house of love, stirring the pot.

"
9269,20 december 2016,scorpio,"Of all the signs you will definitely be the social butterfly of the holiday season! When the Sun enters Capricorn tomorrow, the spotlight will be on you and the people in your circle, not to mention the folks you haven’t met yet. If you’re in the market for new love, start working those social connections! Believe it or not, the “slow” week after Christmas is a wonderful time to network and mingle. Don’t sit at home and binge watch Netflix.

"
9270,21 december 2016,scorpio,"If you don’t ask, you don’t get. It’s a pretty simple statement but a powerful one. Suffering in silence, being shy or expecting others to magically know what you want is not the way to go right now. With the Sun entering the most verbal part of your chart, you should be straight forward about your needs and opinions. Just be diplomatic, please, as Mercury is retrograde here. There’s no need to beat people over the head.

"
9271,22 december 2016,scorpio,"It’s time to get real. Kidding yourself about a person or set of circumstances isn’t going to cut it, not with a Jupiter-Uranus opposition building in the heavens. The good news is that optimistic Jupiter is in one of the most cleansing and healing parts of your chart, so if you need a wakeup call it should come easily and without a lot of drama. Change doesn’t have to be a full-fledged revolution; sometimes just gliding into it does the trick.

"
9272,23 december 2016,scorpio,"Hurry…find some mistletoe! A romantic Moon-Mars aspect brings out the lover in you. Even if you’re single and there are no prospects on the horizon, that can change in the near future. Every day next week from the 26th through New Year’s Day there are super aspects for finding love and sharing romantic moments with an existing amour.

"
9273,24 december 2016,scorpio,"How do you stand out in a crowd? That’s today’s question with a stimulating Saturn-Uranus aspect. The manner in which you present yourself will become all important in the weeks ahead. Take a practical approach to this issue; it’s not necessary to go glam or get involved with gurus. Be yourself, and dazzle.

"
9274,25 december 2016,scorpio,"Of all the signs of the zodiac, your happiness at home is highlighted more than others. Abundant Venus forms three lovely aspects today with other planets, creating a passionate, fun environment. It also appears that more money may be coming your way as stable Saturn in your income house is in a good spot. When Uranus goes direct on the 29th, you’ll be able to say “Show me the money!” with ease.

"
9275,26 december 2016,scorpio,"You might be at the receiving end of a wakeup call today telling you to get your act together. It may sound very Zen-like to say that you’re taking each day as it comes, going with the flow, not letting anything interfere with the movement of your chi– but are you really just flying by the seat of your pants? If you need to become more organized, do so. When you think about it, maintaining a sense of order is essential to most spiritual practices. How many sloppy monasteries or churches do you see?

"
9276,27 december 2016,scorpio,"Should you open up to someone close? With the Sun in your chatty third house, you may feel as though your life should be an open book for anyone to read. But is that wise? Especially in romance, you need to choose what you say to someone close. This isn’t deception; it’s smart strategizing.

"
9277,28 december 2016,scorpio,"Take a far more creative approach to whatever you’re working on, Scorpio. Whether you’re blogging, redecorating your home, choosing a new hairstyle, planning a vacation or working on a client presentation, ask yourself how you could do things differently. Meaning: more eye catching, adventurous, fun, or influential. With tomorrow’s new moon in your house of self expression, you want to go loud and proud, but it certainly doesn’t hurt to shake things up a little.

"
9278,29 december 2016,scorpio,"Got an idea that’s been rolling around in that brain of yours, just dying to get implemented? Now’s the time, Scorpio! The new moon today in Capricorn lets you take your thoughts and make them real. This lunation occurs in your house of self-expression, so pen that novel, code that app, start the blog, paint the picture, design the fashions. With erratic Uranus finally going direct in your house of planning you’ll be able to lay out the necessary steps to take your dreams to a successful conclusion.

"
9279,30 december 2016,scorpio,"They say that flattery will get you everywhere and maybe they’re right! In any case you certainly have the gift of gab today, so use it to your advantage. Not that you should be spewing BS, mind you, but some sincere words of praise from you could go a long way toward making someone else’s day.

"
9280,31 december 2016,scorpio,"Say what you mean what you say. It pays to be as direct as possible with the people around you, both at work and at home, especially if you intend to get anything done. Otherwise you’ll be left holding the bag–and who needs that?

"
9281,1 january 2017,sagittarius,"Some people are hankering for more money in 2017. Others want to get in shape or find a new job. But for you, Sagittarius, it’s all about finding peace of mind and contentment this year. You can’t put a price on it. Even trickier, it comes from within. But Mars and Neptune meet up in the heavens today, motivating and inspiring you to dig down into that inner wellspring of serenity.

"
9282,2 january 2017,sagittarius,"If you’re feeling more emotional and nostalgic recently, it’s not just due to the holidays. A bevy of planets in the sectors that govern love, family and home are creating the desire to feel more grounded. This could intensify today as the Moon connects with Mars and Uranus. This Saturday is an excellent time to figure out what it’s going to take–then take action.

"
9283,3 january 2017,sagittarius,"Romantic relationships may take a far more serious turn over the next four weeks now that Venus is in your house of comfort, security and domestic matters. The “just dating” crowd may decide to move in together or announce an engagement; more established couples could be planning their next pregnancy or the purchase of a home. Singles, you’re not left out of this discussion. Chances are high you’ll be looking for a partner with serious potential, so get moving.

"
9284,4 january 2017,sagittarius,"Unsure about what you’d like to see happen in 2017? If that’s the case, clarity can be achieved over the next week as Mercury retrogrades into your first house of setting goals and self-image. Even if you thought  you knew, go back and revisit your plans! This coming Saturday, the two most authoritative orbs in the solar system, Pluto and the Sun, meet up in your income sector. A major breakthrough could occur, so make sure that you’re ready with a smart elevator pitch, a polished resume or CV, and a strategic marketing plan for 2017.

"
9285,5 january 2017,sagittarius,"The planets are pushing you in so many directions these days, you may not know where to start. Making more money, settling housing issues, handling your kids (not to mention your love life)—all of these are in the cosmos’s crosshairs this week. Why not make life simpler and just for today, focus on matters of the heart. With the emotional Moon swinging past changeable Uranus, it’s time to rewrite your relationship. No lover in sight? That could change pretty soon, especially after the 28th of this month. Then when the weekend arrives, switch your gaze to your career as the Sun meets up with powerful Pluto in your income sector.

"
9286,6 january 2017,sagittarius,"Being happy in love is going to become a driving force for you, archer, and you may feel that strongly today. Next week’s full moon on the 12th is all about passion, lust, intimacy and finding a soulmate. So if your current relationship is about as exciting as watching Seinfeld reruns, you’re either going to have to spice it up or make other plans. When Mercury resumes direct motion on Sunday, the path ahead will become clearer.

"
9287,7 january 2017,sagittarius,"Cha-ching! Everyone loves that sound but it’s going to be much louder for your sign than the other eleven, archer. That’s because take-charge Pluto and the Sun meet up today in your income sector, the place where you can land a new job, earn more, create a solid budget and develop better work habits. Interestingly this is also the house of self-esteem, not surprising really when you consider that our esteem often rises and falls with our savings account balance. It’s an excellent time to focus on the path ahead, to negotiate prosperous deals and to cut the fluff.

"
9288,8 january 2017,sagittarius,"Woo-hoo! Mercury goes direct in your sign, helping clear some of the cobwebs from your brain and roadblocks from your path. Start getting your act together quickly as the messenger planet won’t be here much longer. On Thursday it moves into your income sector, a great time to score a higher paying gig and bank more cash.

"
9289,9 january 2017,sagittarius,"Emotions could be bubbling up all over the place, which includes yours and the people closest to you! This will be a big week for matters of the heart with a full moon on Thursday in your passionate house of intimacy and soulful exchanges. Truth be told, the next few days could be bumpy as you try to figure out what’s going on in other peoples’ minds, as well as trying to understand their agendas and values. Keep your temper in check and wait to get the full picture.

"
9290,10 january 2017,sagittarius,"Someone might throw you a curve ball today or tomorrow, and it could undermine your self confidence. This could be at the office or within a personal relationship and the problem is that it could stall the progress of a project or situation that needs to move forward. This energy carries forward into next week, so be mindful of people in your circle who don’t seem to be team players.

"
9291,11 january 2017,sagittarius,"Money talks, Sagittarius, and today it wants to hold a convo with you—about earning more! You’re in a good place to do so, thanks to the brilliant Sun and transformative Pluto blazing a path through your income sector. Just don’t be too overoptimistic, a potential situation with happy-go-lucky Jupiter in Lala Land today. Your big plans will cost money and will take a lot of time and effort to achieve—don’t lose sight of that.

"
9292,12 january 2017,sagittarius,"Break out the brandy or the Xanax—you’re going to need it! A full moon in your passionate eighth house is going to stir up emotions, not only yours but those of people around you. Erratic Uranus is acting up in the sector that governs lovers and kids, while usually happy Jupiter is in a funk in your friendship sector. So even if you’re as cool as a cucumber, the people closest to you may not be. That being said, this lunation could still be a positive one, as singles might meet a soulmate and attached archers could enjoy even more intimacy with their amour. Mercury has just entered your house of security and guarantees, so you can actually strengthen a relationship after the drama dies down!

"
9293,13 january 2017,sagittarius,"This is no time for playing passive-aggressive games or being a mystery. The cosmos urges you to speak your piece, especially with yesterday’s full moon in the most passionate part of your chart. You actually run the risk of being too emotional, but that’s better than keeping everything locked up inside. Don’t be afraid to lay your cards down on the table. People need to know what you’re thinking.

"
9294,14 january 2017,sagittarius,"If you’ve been holding anything inside, the next four weeks will enable you to get it out there to the right people. The recent full moon fell in your cathartic eighth house, the place where we do inner work by cleansing our psyches of past dramas. Then next Thursday the Sun enters your communicating sector, perfect for holding convos with your tribe. But it also rocks for self-promotion, writing, blogging, teaching and the graphic arts, so if there’s a message you want to deliver, get it ready now.

"
9295,15 january 2017,sagittarius,"This is no time to give in to demands or guilt trips from a lover or family member, or anyone else for that matter. Someone may be trying to push your buttons, but erupting in anger is not the way to go. Stay cool and in control. This energy will be in play for most of the week and may peak on Thursday, so be on your guard.
 
 

"
9296,16 january 2017,sagittarius,"Holding your tongue? You may feel as though you’re biting it these days, afraid to speak your piece at work or with your loved ones. While diplomacy is a valued skill, stuffing your emotions down can result in a volcanic eruption down the road (like this Thursday!). Try to voice your opinions before then, carefully if you must.

"
9297,17 january 2017,sagittarius,"You should start feeling more optimistic about future events as lucky Jupiter sparkles in the sector that governs your closely held wishes. Family matters can especially improve, but that won’t happen by itself–you’ll need to put in some effort. Don’t expect overnight results, as loved ones and real estate issues can take another few weeks to gel. But you have to start somewhere.

"
9298,18 january 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in an emotional place with moody Mars moving through your house of comfort and security. And it’s possible that you’re looking at your friends, drawing comparisons to them and their lifestyle. Is the grass really greener on their side? Perhaps not, something that you may come to realize today. Just remember that your aspirations should be based solely on your authentic self. Life is not a competition.

"
9299,19 january 2017,sagittarius,"Oy vey. The two most stubborn planets in the solar system are at odds today, archer, and of all the signs you may need to chill the most. That’s because serious Saturn is in your sign, facing off against way too emotional Mars. You run the risk of blasting people into the stratosphere with your words and pent up emotions otherwise. If you have something to say, wait until the new moon on the 27th when the aspects are somewhat better for speaking your piece.

"
9300,20 january 2017,sagittarius,"You’ve been up against some tense angles lately, archer, as people around you seem to be intent on pushing your buttons. They may have resorted to guilt, sulking or outright anger, but now you’re in the driver’s seat. That’s because the Sun just entered your communication zone, a helpful aspect that will allow you to get your point across. Put these folks in their place and move on, because it’s time to get some new projects off the ground, especially at the time of the new moon on the 27th.

"
9301,21 january 2017,sagittarius,"Daddy issues, childhood traumas, sibling rivalries begone! We’re all affected by past family dramas, some of us more than others. And if you’re ready to let them go the cosmos is wiling to help. A helpful Moon-Chiron trine will enable youth get to the root of past problems so that you can move on with far less baggage.

"
9302,22 january 2017,sagittarius,"Are you considering launching an exciting new project? Then this is the time to get started, as Friday’s new moon is the perfect moment to initiate it. Today you should be focusing on the resources you’ll need to get things done–the people, funds, habits and routines, and anything else that is necessary for success. Whether it’s a group activity like creating a neighborhood garden or a personal one, such as writing a book, get going.

"
9303,23 january 2017,sagittarius,"Sensitive much? You might feel that way today as Neptune raises questions about certain ties or circumstances in your life. Serious Saturn is pushing you into making some big decisions, but with the Moon close by your emotions could be getting the best of you. Tomorrow is a far better time for having discussions and considering options that will make you feel a lot more settled.

"
9304,24 january 2017,sagittarius,"Sports psychologists and coaches who work with Olympians and other top athletes know that habits can make or break them. Often it’s the ability to stick to a routine, and not talent, that they say creates a champion. Well, archer, the planets are telling you to develop better habits and routines both at home and the office. It appears that you have some readjustments to make. Try to get them done before Friday’s new moon, when your mind will turn to romance and having fun!

"
9305,25 january 2017,sagittarius,"It’s always better to be an efficient, capable person than a listless slacker, but the danger is that you can take on too much responsibility. A powerful Moon-Pluto-Mercury meet up today could be the bucket of cold water dumped on your head that lets you know that you’re overextended. The good thing about this aspect is that it can help you develop better habits and routines. However, the cosmos is also telling you to share your tasks with your family, roommates, and co-workers. It won’t kill them to lift a finger.

"
9306,26 january 2017,sagittarius,"You seem to be in an uncertain place, not knowing if plans of yours are going to work out. There’s a sense of doubt in the air. Do you have the chops to pull something off? Are other people going to cooperate with you? Why are people acting the way they do? The bottom line is that a Venus-Saturn square is shaking your confidence, and it appears that you’re being more pessimistic than is necessary. With abundant Jupiter occupying your house of dreams and wishes, you’re actually in a good spot to witness success and forward movement.

"
9307,27 january 2017,sagittarius,"Got a bright idea that you’d like to pursue? Then there’s no better time than the present, as today’s new moon falls in your house of kick starting projects. Over the next six months you can make amazing headway, whether you’re writing a book, going back to school, developing your portfolio, forming a neighborhood organization or starting a business. Your self-confidence seems to be a bit low at the moment, but this soon passes. Finding a mentor, friend or savvy expert who can help you is advised with a smart Saturn-Jupiter aspect. Set up good habits and systems and you’re ready to rock and roll.

"
9308,28 january 2017,sagittarius,"Put on your dancing shoes! Yesterday’s new moon occurred in your house of socializing and today Mars prances into your sector of romance and having fun. If there’s any sign of the zodiac that should be cutting loose over the next few weeks it’s you, Sagittarius. The only thing that you have to watch for is having too much fun, which might lead to melodrama among your friends and lover(s)—notice that I used the plural form. You won’t be slacking off when it comes to errands and work, though, as Mercury and Pluto in your house of routines and financial security are demanding that some  work gets done.

"
9309,29 january 2017,sagittarius,"Despite the fact that Friday’s new moon fell in your house of socializing, and that yesterday Mars entered your sector of romancing and having fun, the cosmos isn’t going to let you off the hook completely. A stern Pluto-Mercury meeting today demands that you polish up your habits and rituals so that your life runs as smoothly as a Swiss watch. There is a strong financial vibe here. Want to earn more? You can do that and enjoy life at the same time. Just develop the systems you need to take care of business.

"
9310,30 january 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in quite the security conscious mood and today’s Moon-Neptune connection asks that you find serenity. Peace of mind is a form of security, as you aren’t easily rattled by shifting and sometimes disquieting circumstances. There is a quiet strength to serene people. It’s a state that can be achieved if you’re willing to work on it.

"
9311,31 january 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in an excellent spot to earn more money as several celestial orbs are firing up your sectors of thinking and self-expression. This is more about you  coming up with a bright idea, rather than a head hunter calling with a job offer. However, you might feel stymied today, as though the “idea faucet” has been turned off—but this is a temporary blip. Keep at it as the cosmos will be sending some interesting information your way.

"
9312,1 february 2017,sagittarius,"Who’s got your back? That’s a question you’ll be asking yourself between the 6th and early June as Jupiter goes retrograde in your house of friends and contacts. Today a tense face-off between the Moon and Jupiter may cause you to pull away from people as you just don’t want to get sucked into their dramas, nor do you want them stirring stuff up in your life. Protect your space.

"
9313,3 february 2017,sagittarius,"Even the most skilled surgeons, airline pilots and musicians make an effort to improve their capabilities through mentors, practice runs and talent-sharpening workshops. You don’t stop learning till you die, as the saying goes, and with Venus now in your house of talent you should make an effort to be the best you can be: the best mom or dad, teacher, student, employee or boss. The best part? Venus will make it easy.

"
9314,4 february 2017,sagittarius,"Over the next few weeks you may find that you’re more interested in working alone than with a group. Either that, or you’re going to become choosier as to whom you team up with. Two transformative planets, Pluto and Mercury, are in your house of rituals, routines and responsibility. If someone in your circle isn’t pulling their weight you might decide to break from the group or set them straight.

"
9315,5 february 2017,sagittarius,"Over the next few months you’ll need to take a step back and assess where you stand in some of your closest relationships, both at home, at work and in your friendships. Today a tough Neptune-Moon square indicates that there could be some confusion with a lover or family member, and that you’re unsure as to how to proceed. Wait until Tuesday when chatty Mercury enters your verbal sector to make your points clear.

"
9316,6 february 2017,sagittarius,"If you want to get something done, sometimes it’s better to do it yourself! That may be your opinion over the next few months now that Jupiter is retrograding through your house of teamwork. Expect delays from foot dragging colleagues and indecisive team mates, which could also include friends with whom you’re planning an event. You may have to separate the wheat from the chaff if you sense that a pal or team mate is working against the better of the group—or just your best interests. That being said, chatty Mercury enters your communication sector tomorrow, a positive aspect as it can help you straighten things out before they go off the rails. Tech projects especially need to be buttoned up tight.

"
9317,7 february 2017,sagittarius,"Your word is your bond now that chatty Mercury has entered your communication sector. This is a great time to mingle, chat people up and pick someone’s brain for advice. But you may be better off working solo as group efforts can be frustrating over the next few months. Be careful that you share your loftier ideas only with people who are behind you 100%.

"
9318,9 february 2017,sagittarius,"Flirt, sext, wink,  and talk some sweet talk. And while you’re at it, why don’t you call in sick for a play date with a lover? Even if you’re single, today and tomorrow are perfect for some self indulgence. Spontaneity rules, so while you’re out and about you might bump into someone who could be a keeper.

"
9319,10 february 2017,sagittarius,"Sometimes the planets all align in such a manner that you just can’t lose, and that’s what is happening for you today, archer! A spectacular Leo lunar eclipse in the most visionary part of your chart sets the stage for some of your grandest plans to take flight. This is just the beginning of a series of eclipses in Leo that will continue into 2019, with each one pushing you closer and closer to reaching success. The key is to think out of the box, and with super spontaneous Uranus, planet of genius, in a good angle you should have no shortage of creative ideas. Working well with others is also going to be a big part of your journey, so don’t try to go lone wolf.

"
9320,11 february 2017,sagittarius,"It’s time to crowd source, archer. A magnificent Sun-Jupiter trine sets the stage for collaborations or team activities to take off like a rocket. Jupiter is retrograde, which means that you have to be choosy when taking on a partner or asking someone to join the group. But the people who surround you now can help take your ideas to a much higher level.

"
9321,12 february 2017,sagittarius,"Strong arming people in your circle to do or see things your way could backfire, Sagittarius. The problem is that they may be talking in circles or not acting in ways that are acceptable, and your initial response may be to take charge and fire back. Let it slide. By Tuesday things improve, and a strong Saturn-Sun aspect helps you speak with clarity and conviction.

"
9322,13 february 2017,sagittarius,"Speak up for yourself! It’s time to step up and let other people know how you feel. Over the next ten days your ability to dazzle, flirt, emote and just plain old socialize skyrockets. Today you may not want to come on too strong due to a Moon-Sun aspect, but tomorrow works for being straightforward.

"
9323,14 february 2017,sagittarius,"This is no Valentine’s Day to sit in front of the TV with a pizza, archer. Mars and Venus are in the most frisky, romantic house of them all, and the Moon is in the house of celebrating. All Sagittarians should be out on the town tonight regardless of romantic status. Singles, your best place to meet someone is right in town rather than online, so put on your red dress and head for the door.

"
9324,15 february 2017,sagittarius,"Life shouldn’t be all about work, something that you’ll be reminded of today. With energetic Mars striding through your house of creativity, it’s time to plunge into passion projects that mean a lot to you. But you might want to take a fresh look at them for an update. And you also might be better off diving into them solo rather than waiting for other people to come round and join you.

"
9325,16 february 2017,sagittarius,"Hope you’re getting enough sleep. Effervescent Mercury in your house of networking is in full social butterfly mode and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. Take this energy and run with it, as the people you meet in the days ahead could stand the test of time.

"
9326,17 february 2017,sagittarius,"What you think and what you say should be two separate things, today, archer! The problem is that your intuition might be off, causing you to make statements that are based on mixed-up notions rather than cold, hard facts. Likewise, if you’re at the receiving end of a secret—or you have one of your own—keep it under wraps, unless you want to deal with the fallout later on.

"
9327,18 february 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in a terrific spot to talk things over with loved ones, friends and colleagues over the next few weeks, developing a stronger sense of security in the process. The Sun is now in your house of emotional grounding where it will remain for the next month. Don’t hold back your feelings: let them out, especially after the 25th when chatty Mercury joins the Sun in this sector.

"
9328,19 february 2017,sagittarius,"Getting through to people and understanding what makes them tick should be far easier in the days ahead. Today and tomorrow are excellent for communicating with kids and lovers, and Tuesday works for smoothing things over with friends and colleagues. Don’t forget that your voice needs to be heard too.

"
9329,20 february 2017,sagittarius,"Can you get away for a three-day weekend with a lover or some friends? The planets are in a spontaneous mood today, suggesting that you treat yourself to a little holiday. Even if you travel solo it will do wonders for recharging your batteries. Not only that, your creativity will rise and a sense of emotional release will ensue. You need to take a break, archer!

"
9330,21 february 2017,sagittarius,"A glittering trine in your people-centric house of warmth and camaraderie could bring some happy news, Sagittarius. It’s also a good day to make plans with friends, get your ideas across to a group, or showcase your brand on the Internet. This is no time for being shy. Show the world what you’ve got!

"
9331,22 february 2017,sagittarius,"It’s time to put on your big boy pants and get out of the sand box, Sagittarius. If you don’t, you could get pulled into infantile hissy fits that are being pitched by others around you. The two most obstinate planets, Mars and Pluto, are at odds today, leading to drama, head games and power plays. You may feel as though your security is being threatened, but it’s not.

"
9332,23 february 2017,sagittarius,"You mean business, archer, and today’s a good day to express your thoughts. Whether you’re disciplining a child or employee, indulging in sweet talk with a lover or making a big-bucks presentation to a client, your words carry weight. And so they should. With logical Saturn at your side, you have wisdom working for you.

"
9333,24 february 2017,sagittarius,"The upcoming eclipse will remind you that having a happy life at home is of utmost importance. The sense of security and comfort you get there carries over into other areas of your life. Today a lunar aspect opens up the lines of communication with a lover and children, so don’t hold back. Show them how much you care.

"
9334,25 february 2017,sagittarius,"Facing up to issues that have troubled you in the past should become easier now that Mercury is in Pisces. This is especially true of dramas that got their start with family ties or old romantic relationships that went sour. A solar eclipse tomorrow in the same part of the sky could be the final push you need to release them once and for all.

"
9335,26 february 2017,sagittarius,"Don’t be in such a rush to cement a bond that you overlook potential problems, Sagittarius. A solar eclipse in the sector that deals with warm and fuzzy feelings of nesting and closeness could make you too anxious. That being said, if you take your time allow things to gel, the next six months could be a highly rewarding time in which you can experience rich affection for someone–and that includes someone new.

"
9336,27 february 2017,sagittarius,"There’s a lot more to romance than a physical attraction, something that you’d be wise to remember today. The two most hot-blooded planets, Mars and Uranus, meet up in your frisky house of amour, which could lead to a steamy boudoir session. Which is fine…unless you just met the person yesterday and you’re looking for a spouse, or an existing relationship is a mess but the sex is good. Drama and fighting could also erupt, so don’t say or do anything you may regret.

"
9337,28 february 2017,sagittarius,"Habits and routines have a useful purpose, something that you should be paying more attention to. A sweet balance needs to be struck between finding enough time for play and pleasure, and also getting the mundane tasks done. The recent solar eclipse in your house of contentment tells you that if you want “mind like water” you need to remove the stress of undone chores.

"
9338,1 march 2017,sagittarius,"The Chinese culture is known for honoring its ancestors. One of the things they do is to create a little shrine at home in memory of their loved ones. Why not do the same? A meet-up of sentimental Neptune and the Sun in the most nostalgic part of your chart encourages you to pay homage to the people who trod this Earth before you. Look back with fondness and look forward with peace in your heart.

"
9339,2 march 2017,sagittarius,"Stepping away from a person may be the smartest thing you can do today, archer. A tough opposition between Jupiter and Uranus, the first of its kind in 14 years, could stir up way too much drama in their life, which could spill over into yours. This doesn’t mean cutting ties; instead, a little “time out” may be just what the doctor ordered. There’s a reason why people are called “energy vampires”. Make sure that no one is sucking the life force out of you, even if it’s someone you love dearly.

"
9340,3 march 2017,sagittarius,"Too busy to spend quality time with your kids or lover? Uh…you’ll certainly hear about it when Venus starts a four-week retrograde on Saturday. Why not cut them off at the pass? A helpful Moon-Pluto aspect today is perfect for creating new routines that will free up more precious hours. Do it now or face the music!

"
9341,4 march 2017,sagittarius,"Don’t like drama? Then avoid it like the plague between now and April 2nd. Venus retrogrades in your fifth house and theatrics could start to interrupt your life. This is especially true in romantic relationships or with kids. While you can’t control what other people will do, you can  control your own actions. Make sure that you’re not bringing unnecessary conflict into your day.

"
9342,5 march 2017,sagittarius,"Love planet Venus just retrograded in your romance sector, and if you’ve had on rose-colored glasses about an alliance, they’ll be stripped right off today. Mature, stable Saturn is on the case, telling you to get real about the state of your union. Singles, you could have a wakeup call about the kind of person you really need in your life.

"
9343,6 march 2017,sagittarius,"Need to straighten out a family matter? This is one of the best weeks in ages to do so. Today a super Mercury-Sun aspect helps you get to the bottom of issues and take an authoritative stance–without drama and threats. From your chart it looks like people under your roof (or extended family members) may need to take on more personal responsibility. Set boundaries and let them know what you expect.

"
9344,7 march 2017,sagittarius,"Something might happen today that will rattle your sense of security, but it’s a temporary blip. Your outlook for living a more secure, comfortable life is indeed excellent—in money, career, love and family. Once Mars moves into Taurus on Thursday you’ll start to feel more pulled together.

"
9345,8 march 2017,sagittarius,"The cosmos is suggesting that you save or invest more money into real estate, archer. If you don’t own a place, set up a savings account solely for down payment cash—then vow to put something in there every week, no matter how small an amount. If you already own, then consider paying down your mortgage more quickly or refinancing to get a better rate. Maybe you need to splurge on some new furniture or linens so that you can really enjoy your living space. Do whatever it takes!

"
9346,9 march 2017,sagittarius,"Your motivation level will skyrocket in the near future, thanks to aggressive Mars entering your efficiency sector today. Slackers, red tape and obstacles could get annoying pretty quickly under this aspect so keep your cool. If you’re ready to move on with your career or another important goal, Sunday’s full moon could be a turning point when you decide to walk away from the past.

"
9347,10 march 2017,sagittarius,"It’s time to take a 48-hour break from worrying about your career and family members, archer. With the Moon in fun, frisky Leo, chill out with your friends, lover or even a good book tonight and tomorrow. Once the full moon occurs on Sunday in your ambitious tenth house, you’ll be putting the pedal to the metal. Rest up while you can.

"
9348,11 march 2017,sagittarius,"What really floats your boat, archer? Tomorrow’s full moon in Virgo falls in your house of ambition and goals. A Sun-Jupiter aspect today may find you questioning what would make you happiest when it comes to your career and other desires. You may decide to toss out or revise goals that previously were all-important. You’ve changed, and your new plans should reflect that.

"
9349,12 march 2017,sagittarius,"What really floats your boat, archer? Today’s full moon in Virgo falls in your house of ambition and goals. A Sun-Jupiter aspect today may find you questioning what would make you happiest when it comes to your career and other desires. You may decide to toss out or revise goals that previously were all-important. You’ve changed, and your new plans should reflect that.

"
9350,13 march 2017,sagittarius,"This is  no time to hold back in love! You could be feeling strong, sexy and in control thanks to the full moon on Sunday in your house of self esteem and clout. And today sociable Mercury zips into your romance sector, helping you flirt like nobody’s business. Watch out for stirring things up too much, though, as jealousy or resentment could percolate.

"
9351,14 march 2017,sagittarius,"We all know that group activities can be fraught with stress, as some people don’t pull their weight or can’t agree on a direction. Someone may act out today in a team environment, but don’t let this throw you off your game. You’re on the right track. You may hold back from responding this week, but once the 20th arrives you can move forward with your creative vision.

"
9352,15 march 2017,sagittarius,"Someone could come into your orbit over the next day or two who could end up being a wonderful new friend, mentor or business contact. Sometimes the universe delivers the right people to us at just the right time. Keep an open mind and get ready to socialize.

"
9353,16 march 2017,sagittarius,"Your intuition will be able to help you in coming up with a solution to a problem, especially one that deals with your family or your personal emotional state. Truth be told, there are some difficult aspects in the heavens that could be stirring up your feelings. Don’t let other people push your buttons to the point where you have no say-so in important matters.

"
9354,17 march 2017,sagittarius,"Major life changes can happen when Saturn is in your sign, which has been the case over the past two years. You’re changing as a person, figuring out what works and what doesn’t. As a result you may have made some major decisions about where you live, your relationships with family members and where you’re headed in your love life. But you could be facing resistance from loved ones who feel threatened by your new attitude, something that may become apparent today.

"
9355,18 march 2017,sagittarius,"Talk flirty to me! A super sweet meet up of Venus and Mercury sets the stage for socializing, winking and love talk. It’s also a terrific weekend for artistic types to display their talents. Think that you’re not creative? Please. We all have hobbies that we like to indulge in. Spend some time unwinding with the activities that you enjoy best.

"
9356,19 march 2017,sagittarius,"With the Sun about to enter one of the most enjoyable parts of your chart, you could be feeling ready for romance, socializing and having fun in your free time. Nothing wrong with that! But stern Saturn warns you today to get real–about your emotions, the people in your circle, your values and your dreams. Otherwise you may spend the next four weeks chasing down things that aren’t a reflection of the real you.

"
9357,20 march 2017,sagittarius,"Romantic reboot! The fiery Sun is now in Aries, your house of amour and enjoying the finer things in life. This is a terrific aspect for finding new love, growing a romance or even conceiving a baby. Our skills and talents are also found in this sector, so if you need to polish yours up why not sign up for a class or a seminar? Get back into hobbies and sports that you used to enjoy. Life’s too short to be working all the time.

"
9358,21 march 2017,sagittarius,"Optimistic Jupiter has been stirring you to do things that go beyond your personal needs, such as giving back with volunteer work. Yes, one person can change the world (Gandhi, for instance) but progress can get held up by opposing forces. Don’t let this stop you. Whatever your personal passion may be, pursue it—and go under, around or over obstacles.

"
9359,22 march 2017,sagittarius,"Your talents could be in demand over the next few weeks, so get ready to show them off. But whatever you do, don’t sell them to the lowest bidder! If someone tries to hire you on the cheap tell them politely that you’re worth more. The same holds true for love, Sagittarius. Dignity comes from recognizing your own value as a human being.

"
9360,23 march 2017,sagittarius,"Pluto’s job is to point out the weaknesses in situations, whether it’s your finances, emotions or romance, just to name a few. And today this little tough guy could hand you a reality check about all three. As a result you may feel insecure about where your life is heading and try to demand answers from people around you. Bad move! Wait until Saturday, as a tense T-square in the heavens today and tomorrow could lead to arguments and hurt feelings.

"
9361,24 march 2017,sagittarius,"You may be feeling passionate about a person, a cause or a plan, but despite your positive energy you could face setbacks today. Usually-optimistic Jupiter is in a tough spot, suggesting that others may not support your plans, or that you need to reconsider some aspects of them. Not to worry, however. Your creative mojo rises tomorrow with a strong Sun-Venus aspect and gets even better at the time of Tuesday’s new moon.

"
9362,25 march 2017,sagittarius,"The past few days may have bumpy, with friends and lovers acting out. However, a nice and easy meeting of the Sun and Venus in your house of romance and fun can smooth things over. If you’re interested in meeting someone new, doors will start to open over the next few weeks. Attached archers should start to carve out more quality time for their loved ones, which also includes kids–who are a part of this sector.

"
9363,26 march 2017,sagittarius,"Attention, archers! Maverick planet Uranus is acting up in your house of romance—and it’s good  trouble that it’s causing. A lover could plan an unexpected but fun date, something that’s a far cry from the usual. Singles could meet someone new in a way that they never dreamed of (laundry room, supermarket, doctor’s office). This energy carries on into the next few weeks, so be prepared.

"
9364,27 march 2017,sagittarius,"Bright ideas? You could be full of them this week, due to the influence of genius Uranus and brainy Mercury. Don’t be concerned about following the crowd and fitting in. If you have something interesting to talk about, get it out there. People may not realize the value of your brainstorms at first but they eventually will.

"
9365,28 march 2017,sagittarius,"New levels of closeness can be reached with a lover or your kids in the months ahead, archer. You can thank today’s new moon for that! Obviously you’ll have to put in some effort, but between now and September rich affection and playfulness are the name of the game. Single Sagittarians can meet an a amorous new flame, so get out there and start mingling.

"
9366,29 march 2017,sagittarius,"Serious Saturn in your sign will encourage you to let other people know that you mean business, archer! Today the ringed planet forms a fabulous aspect with verbal Mercury, enabling you to talk to a lover or kids with clarity, kindness and firmness. Yesterday’s new moon in the part of your chart that governs loved ones will help you enjoy more quality time with them and strengthen your bond.

"
9367,30 march 2017,sagittarius,"Thanks to the recent new moon in the most creative and fun-loving part of your chart, you may be dying to break away from an old look, attitude, routine or rut. Sticking with the same old-same old may be tempting too, as it’s a comfortable place to be. So what’s an archer to do? Think things over and wait for Mercury to enter Taurus tomorrow. You’ll be in a great spot to strategize and create some new habits.

"
9368,31 march 2017,sagittarius,"Make haste with streamlining procedures, either at home or the office. Efficient little Mercury buzzes into your productivity sector where it will remain in direct motion until April 9th. Knock out errands and empty that to-do list as best you can. The recent new moon in Aries will help you find more creative ways to get things done, by the way, so start thinking about how you approach the daily grind with a fresh set of eyes.

"
9369,1 april 2017,sagittarius,"They say that habits make the man (and the woman), and now’s the time to polish up yours. Mercury enters your house of efficiency today, forcing you to examine just how you go about your day. It will retrograde from the 9th til the 18th in this sector, so don’t be surprised if inefficiencies in your systems and routines smack you right in the face. That’s OK–change them and live a more serene lifestyle.

"
9370,2 april 2017,sagittarius,"Don’t be so emo! That’s what others may tell you, or that’s what you may be telling yourself over the next two weeks. Venus has just gone retrograde in your fourth house, so you may become sensitive and take things too much to heart. Romance may get a little dicey as you overthink matters. This vibe ends on the 15th, at which time sweet clarity will return.

"
9371,3 april 2017,sagittarius,"Matters of the heart could hit a few snags with a Moon-Sun square. You may be looking for answers—hell, demanding  answers—but that doesn’t mean that your partner is willing to open up. This situation could become more intense by the weekend, and by the time of next Tuesday’s full moon you’ll be expecting full disclosure. Love planet Venus finishes its retrograde on the 15th at which time things should start improving.

"
9372,4 april 2017,sagittarius,"A lover might make demands on you today that you’re not ready to agree to. Whether they want an engagement ring, more quality time, greater intimacy, better sex or more open communication, you may resent the request. This will continue into next week, so be on your guard. Likewise it may be you who is demanding answers. The full moon on Tuesday will help you determine if you’re on the same page.

"
9373,5 april 2017,sagittarius,"With emotional Neptune in the most sensitive part of your chart you may be prone to acting on feelings rather than logic. But today the moon advises you to pay attention to the feelings that tell you to break free from old confining roles. Life’s too short to play it safe.

"
9374,6 april 2017,sagittarius,"Mature, stern Saturn has been in your sign for over two years, and as a result major changes may have happened in your life. This is the planet of living successfully for the long term, and today it retrogrades for several months. If any part of your life needs an upgrade, now’s the time to go after it—a fresh self-image, improved health, a career change, new love, moving to another part of the country, or starting a business, just as examples. This may require slowing down, conducting research, learning more and making some tough decisions, but it will be worth it.

"
9375,7 april 2017,sagittarius,"The people you love the most may be battling to spend time with you, archer, something that could start getting on your nerves! While it’s wonderful to have friends, a lover and be involved in community and volunteer activities, you may be spreading yourself too thin. Think about your commitments and ask yourself if you have time for all of them. The full moon next Tuesday will help you make decisions about the company you keep.

"
9376,8 april 2017,sagittarius,"Your security may feel threatened by four planets that are testily glaring at each other across the heavens. Whether it’s financial insecurity or feeling unsettled about a romance, you may feel anxious and concerned. If there’s a silver lining here, it’s that logical Saturn is in your sign, helping you sort out fantasy from reality. Don’t let other people try to call the shots either. It’s your life and you deserve some guarantees.

"
9377,9 april 2017,sagittarius,"Cut the red tape! Now that Mercury is retrograde in your efficiency zone, you may realize that you’re drowning in inefficient habits and routines, not to mention dealing with slackers who create even more work for you. Between now and the 20th vow to get a grip on your everyday chores both at home and at the office. If that means hiring a house cleaner or an assistant at work, do it. But the bottom line is that your personal habits will count more than anything else.

"
9378,10 april 2017,sagittarius,"Your powers of persuasion are strong and you should be networking to the best of your ability. While you can cut business deals or find a new job this way, you can also use the gift of gab for making a difference in the world. Tomorrow’s full moon falls in your house of charitable work, and with your powerful Sagittarian vision you can move mountains.

"
9379,11 april 2017,sagittarius,"Do you need to put some distance between you and acquaintances, or do you need to create closer bonds? That’s the question behind today’s full moon. Separate the true blue pals and colleagues from the pretenders and frenemies. With logical Saturn in a good angle you’ll make the right decision–not to mention forging some new bonds that will last for decades.

"
9380,12 april 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in an excellent spot to understand someone else’s point of view, thanks to a lovely lunar aspect. And you can also understand more of what makes you  tick. Venus has been retrograde for a month in an emotional sector, which may have found you thinking about issues from the past and how to resolve them. The golden planet moves direct on Saturday, clearing confusion and pointing the way ahead.

"
9381,13 april 2017,sagittarius,"Do your homework on a money issue: make sure that you have all the numbers crunched and the facts on your side. You’re in an excellent spot to make financial headway but you  need to be calling the shots. Don’t let anyone rush or strong arm you into making a decision.

"
9382,14 april 2017,sagittarius,"This is not a day to make fast decisions, especially in matters of the heart. Erratic Uranus is stirring the pot, which could create a sudden argument or a heated attraction! Simmer down and wait for Venus to resume direct motion tomorrow. It will put you in a more grounded place where you’ll be more focused on the long term and security.

"
9383,15 april 2017,sagittarius,"Hallelujah–Venus stops retrograding through your fourth house of serenity, comfort and family. Now you can get back on better terms with loved ones, not to mention setting aside some much needed down time for yourself. If you and a lover have been at odds over key issues the confusion should start to dissipate. This is also a great time to relax more at home rather than being out on the town.

"
9384,16 april 2017,sagittarius,"The pace may be picking up both at home and at work, thanks to planets in these sectors being active. But today you can find a happy medium between the two. You should be considering how to spend more down time relaxing with loved ones, not to mention sneaking in some quality time for yourself. When the Sun enters Taurus later this week your workload will increase; balance is necessary.

"
9385,17 april 2017,sagittarius,"Serious talks can take place between you and loved ones, especially children or your amour. It’s time to get problems ironed out and make big plans for the future. With the authoritative Sun and long-term Saturn forming a fabulous angle, this is one of the best times all year to make progress.

"
9386,18 april 2017,sagittarius,"If cash flow problems have you concerned, don’t get emotional about it, a possibility today with the moon in a vulnerable spot. You’ll be able to gain control over matters once Pluto goes retrograde in this part of your chart on Thursday. Pluto is all about owning up to yourself and stepping into a position of control. You’ve got this.

"
9387,19 april 2017,sagittarius,"Beware of burning the candle at both ends, archer. The energetic Sun is now in your house of multi-tasking, which can actually be a good thing as it will motivate you to declutter and get organized both at home and at work. The problem is that Pluto is about to retrograde this Thursday in your income sector, stirring up fears about not having enough cash. You may respond by throwing yourself into a working frenzy, burning out in the process. Maintain a logical attitude about your cash flow.

"
9388,20 april 2017,sagittarius,"Fears of loss may start to crop up now that subterranean Pluto is back stroking through your security sector. This includes your income and career as well as romantic unions, so it’s imperative to not let worries get the best of you between now and late September. The good news is that assertive Mars is about to enter your committed relationship house on Friday, a place it hasn’t been in over two years. If you’re looking to form a more prosperous business alliance or a happier romance you’ll have the opportunity to do so, and get rid of some of those fears in the process.

"
9389,21 april 2017,sagittarius,"Put on your seatbelt, archer, you’re in for a bumpy ride when it comes to romance. Mars enters your house of serious commitment today, which should  be good news for those seeking a new lover, an engagement ring or a deeper level of bonding with their amour. The problem is that Mercury just retrograded yesterday in your romance house, making you question your situation. The next few weeks could be full of drama and misunderstandings. Once May 3rd arrives things should calm down and the future will easier to determine.

"
9390,22 april 2017,sagittarius,"Not ready to settle down? A tense Venus-Saturn square indicates that family or housing issues could get stalled: moving in with your boyfriend, conceiving a baby, relocating to a new place or settling issues with your parents. With Saturn in your sign it appears that you’re the logical one and that others around you are not—unless they’re archers too! Don’t let anyone sweet talk or guilt you into doing something that you don’t think is smart or affordable right now.

"
9391,23 april 2017,sagittarius,"There’s a strong nesting vibe in the air for you today, perfect for lolling at home with your loved ones. If you do go out, head to the store and shop for new duvets, furniture, dishes and tableware. The planet of luxury and beauty, Venus, has set up camp in your domestic fourth house and wants you to create a lush lair. Comfort counts as much as beauty, so create a place that makes you feel content.

"
9392,24 april 2017,sagittarius,"A happy development could arise in your love life as Mercury winks at Saturn. Someone may spill how they truly feel for you; a relationship could move up to the next logical step; or baby talk could ensue. Speaking of kids, this aspect takes place in the part of your chart that deals with them, so there could also be good news concerning one of your kids.

"
9393,25 april 2017,sagittarius,"Amorous Venus will be gliding into your love sector this weekend, so bring on the romance! This will be Venus’s second trip here this year, so if a relationship was strained before it could experience rebirth now. Today spontaneous Uranus is in fine form, encouraging you to do things differently. Maybe you should seek out a new type. Perhaps you need to bring more excitement into an existing relationship by planning more date nights at new venues. Think outside of the box!

"
9394,26 april 2017,sagittarius,"New business opportunities could come your way—which includes a job offer—but you need to take a more creative approach in order to make them happen. Today’s new moon in the work sector of your chart can open doors, and over the next six months you can see big changes. Approach projects from a different viewpoint. Take classes that will help you think more originally.

"
9395,27 april 2017,sagittarius,"Your stress level is definitely connected in part to your habits and routines. Are they serving you or are you a blind slave to them? Power broker Pluto is telling you to gain control over your life by establishing new routines that will smooth the path ahead. This includes your eating patterns and workout schedule (or lack thereof!). Start pulling things together so that you’re in charge.

"
9396,28 april 2017,sagittarius,"Ggrrr! The archer is looking and sounding more like a tiger now that sexpot Venus is in your romance sector. Spontaneous Uranus is also acting out, encouraging you to take a chance of some kind: being more of a flirt, asking someone out, switching up your date night routine or even changing the way you dress. Life is certainly taking a more exciting turn. Make the most of it!

"
9397,29 april 2017,sagittarius,"What you want and what somebody else wants could be two different things this weekend. The question is, how will it play out? Judging from your chart you’re going to stick to your guns. The recent new moon in Taurus is only increasing your practicality and desire to get things done. If others don’t want to play along they could be tossed to the curb pretty quickly!

"
9398,30 april 2017,sagittarius,"It’s a perfect day for some “mental house cleaning”! It’s time to take out the trash, meaning dissatisfaction, stress, fear, jealousy and all the other stinky emotions that clutter up our minds. A super Sun-Moon aspect encourages you to seek healing modalities like meditation, reiki, affirmations and maybe even a detox diet. A shaman or holistic practitioner may be just the person you need right now.

"
9399,1 may 2017,sagittarius,"A sudden independent streak may hit you, especially when it comes to romance. Singles may rebel against getting involved, while attached archers may resist a warm and fuzzy “caring and sharing” session. If anyone tries to play head games with you, using guilt or sex as a weapon, you’re going to set them straight.

"
9400,2 may 2017,sagittarius,"People who may not have supported your ideas or dreams may come around, archer. There’s a cooperative mood in the air as the Moon forms a terrific aspect with Mars. Not only might they believe in your vision, it’s also possible that they might want to join you on your journey. Be discerning and consider whether you want to fly solo or have company.

"
9401,3 may 2017,sagittarius,"Woo-hoo! Mercury goes direct in the house that deals with enjoying life to the fullest. This includes romance, so if your love life has felt like the desert, rather than a lush tropical garden of early delights, things should turn around. It’s also a great time to indulge in your creative talents, hobbies and sports over the next few weeks.

"
9402,4 may 2017,sagittarius,"Love might take an, uh, interesting  turn today. Someone at the office may be crushing on you; or perhaps you’re harboring secret feelings for a co-worker, boss or client! Take it easy there, archer. Even if you’re not being tempted by an office liaison it’s likely that you’re interested in a partner with solid financial backing, someone who has a strong foundation and maturity. And what’s wrong with that?

"
9403,5 may 2017,sagittarius,"Keep an eye on team members as a Jupiter-Sun aspect advises discernment. The roles that people play and the tasks that they’re responsible for may need to be changed. This is true whether you’re planning a wedding, staging a play, launching an entrepreneurial venture or putting together a charitable foundation. Find the right person for the right duties.

"
9404,6 may 2017,sagittarius,"Lusting for the more expensive things—the racy sports car, beachside dream home or designer wardrobe? You could be, with the Moon in the part of your chart that seeks prestige. The problem is that your current circumstances seem to be hemming you in. Not only that, Saturn in your sign may be making you feel as though the only important thing in life is a safe paycheck. Consider your options!

"
9405,7 may 2017,sagittarius,"Need to get something off your chest? Then reach out to a close friend or mentor as they could provide you with just the right words of wisdom today! You probably have a lot on your mind considering that Wednesday’s full moon occurs in your house of closure. Talk to the people who have your best interests at heart.

"
9406,8 may 2017,sagittarius,"A close friend or lover may tell you something that you don’t want to hear, archer. There’s a full moon coming this week in the sector that deals with cutting ties and releasing bad habits and memories. The question is: do you need to separate from some of these people? Or are they tipping you off about changes that you desperately need to make in your own behavior and thought patterns?

"
9407,9 may 2017,sagittarius,"Some sizzling opportunities to earn more money could come your way, Scorpio, so get ready to impress! Have your resume, brag book or portfolio ready. Get caught up on tasks and e-mails. Decision makers have their eyes on you and you want to show them only the very best that you have to offer. Some of these people may be hiding in the wings, so keep that in mind as you go through your day.

"
9408,10 may 2017,sagittarius,"Out with the old…in with the new. It’s obviously not New Year’s Eve but it is  your annual full moon in the house of closure and healing. If there is going to be a time in 2017 when you can turn a new leaf it’s now. Frenemies, bad habits, dead end jobs, carrying a torch for an ex, hurt feelings from past dysfunctional family dramas—kick ‘em to the curb and move on. You may especially be sensitive to matters of the heart as maverick Uranus and intelligent Mercury are deep in conversation in the house of romance. Should you stay or should you go?

"
9409,11 may 2017,sagittarius,"Who’s running the show? If anyone in your life is pushing you around like you’re part of a cattle herd, chances are you’ll lash out today. An overbearing spouse, nosy in-law, demanding parent, pushy lover, or critical business partner could try to exert influence over you. And they’ll regret it too, thanks to an aggressive Mars aspect. It’s also possible that passive-aggressive or guilt tactics may be part of their repertoire, so don’t fall for it. Stand your ground.

"
9410,12 may 2017,sagittarius,"The more the merrier! Abundant Jupiter is in your house of socializing and networking, and promises that you’ll gain more than just having fun from hanging out with other people. The connections you make right now could have a profound effect on your future: you could find a new mate, gain entry into an elite group of investors or brilliant thinkers, make lifelong friends or find the perfect mentor. But it’s up to you to get the ball rolling, so find the perfect place to start schmoozing.

"
9411,13 may 2017,sagittarius,"Every now and then the cosmos tells us to get our lives in order, and that’s the message for you today, archer! From your household chores to your workout routine, you need to become more efficient. Get rid of the piles of paper on your desk, catch up on unfinished projects at work and at home, and let others know that you expect them to do their share. The relief that you feel will be palpable. Talk about instant stress reduction!

"
9412,14 may 2017,sagittarius,"Sometimes the smartest way to get ahead is to sit back and let opportunity come to you. With lucky Jupiter in your house of networking and friends, the people on your contact list are the best source of finding what you’re looking for in life.

"
9413,15 may 2017,sagittarius,"Playing by the rules is important this week, and you should also be working on developing better habits and routines. But the cosmos tells you that the onus is not only on you to get your act together: the people closest to you need to do the same. And you need to diplomatically tell them that. Otherwise when Mercury enters the most efficient part of your chart on Tuesday you’ll end up being overburdened and burnt out.

"
9414,16 may 2017,sagittarius,"Practical details are the order of the day now that capable Mercury is in your house of efficiency. Between now and June 6th you should be focusing on how to get more done in less time, at home as well as work. If that means getting rid of slacker employees or laying down some serious consequences for kids who won’t clean their rooms, so be it. At least you should be able to get a spouse or business partner in line after the Sun changes signs on Saturday!

"
9415,17 may 2017,sagittarius,"Wishful thinking can sometimes take you to the unrealistic land of unicorns and rainbows. However, it can also take you to a place of creation and fulfillment. The great scientists, investors, writers and artists all started out with what people often derided as “wishful thinking”. You’re in a terrific spot to take a dream and run with it, so stop thinking and begin by taking action.

"
9416,18 may 2017,sagittarius,"Slow your roll in matters of the heart, archer. Amorous Venus is in a tough mood today, warning against “pink fluffy clouds” kind of thinking. It’s imperative to know if you and a lover share the same values and long term goals. Singles, don’t be in such a rush to land a lover that you overlook big problems in a potential mate. The greatest source of wisdom these days is you; the opinions of your pals may be way off, so trust your own gut.

"
9417,19 may 2017,sagittarius,"Shake, rattle and roll! Staid Saturn has been plodding through your sign for two years, which is wonderful for developing maturity, thinking logically and creating smart long-term plans. But it can also make your life a little….yawn….too safe. Which is why you should enjoy today’s megawatt Uranus-Saturn trine, in which rebellious Uranus tells you to bust out of that safe little groove you’ve been in. How can you add more creativity and enjoyment to your life? The good news is that this energy will last for the next six months. Fuel your more passionate side.

"
9418,20 may 2017,sagittarius,"Your love life may start taking some interesting twists and turns now that the Sun is in your commitment sector. While you can certainly meet someone new (who is a serious prospect, by the way) or take an existing relationship to the next level, there may some frissons of doubt in your mind. Sober Saturn, that planet of logical thinking and planning long term, will be in a tough angle over the next few weeks. You may question whether you want to stay in a union. Or, you’re not sure if your needs are being met—and an independent streak is starting to develop. The new moon on the 25th will be a turning point, a time to make decisions.

"
9419,21 may 2017,sagittarius,"Feeling frisky and flirty? You should be with the Moon in the most charismatic part of your chart! Turn on the charm over the next few days to land a new lover or to enjoy more romantic times with your current amour. This also happens to be the house of creativity, so let your talents flow. Don’t be surprised if later this week someone has noticed your skills and suggests a deal, job or partnership.

"
9420,22 may 2017,sagittarius,"Crossed wires may be confusing key relationships and it’s up to you to untangle them. Luckily, sweet Venus is in a helpful spot today. You may discover that some of the confusion is coming from you, which means that a little self reflection is in order. Get your head screwed on straight early in the week as the new moon on Thursday highlights alliances.

"
9421,23 may 2017,sagittarius,"With so much current planetary activity in your house of partnering and sharing with others, no one could blame you for trying to be team player (which also includes being part of a romantic relationship). But the cosmos warns that you shouldn’t lose your identity in the process. You have needs and dreams and desires which should be explored. If you neglect this primal need you could end up being resentful and burned out. Balance is the key.

"
9422,24 may 2017,sagittarius,"When it comes to relating to people these days, the cosmos tells you to keep things real and keep them brief. No long winded discussions are necessary, no flattery, no confusing stories, no passive aggressive nonsense. This may not go over well with the people you know but that’s too bad. It’s better for everyone involved if you’re as straightforward as possible.

"
9423,25 may 2017,sagittarius,"It’s time to get serious about your connections with others, whether it’s in business or romance. Commitment is a two-way street and today’s new moon helps you cement bonds. If anyone in your life brings too much drama to the table, is immature or can’t carry out the responsibilities they’re supposed to be handling then you need to set them straight.This may take more than one attempt but it needs to be done.

"
9424,26 may 2017,sagittarius,"Don’t lock yourself in to strict plans this weekend as spontaneous Uranus is looking for a good time. Instead of doing the same-old, same-old this holiday weekend, why not fly by the seat of your pants and do something completely different? Sports, entertainment and travel are all in the stars for your sign so get out there and have a good time.

"
9425,27 may 2017,sagittarius,"People may be sending conflicting messages and you could be at a loss as to how to read them. This will continue into next week, so why bother wasting any time on trying to figure it out right now? A happy Moon-Uranus aspect encourages you to get out there this weekend and have some fun.

"
9426,28 may 2017,sagittarius,"Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home! And this weekend is the perfect time to refresh your living quarters. Sure, cleaning out closets makes you feel more organized, but with inspirational Neptune on the job you should also go shopping for some luxe things for your digs.

"
9427,29 may 2017,sagittarius,"Yowza! Slow down there, archer. Just because hot blooded Mars is tearing through your commitment sector doesn’t mean that (a) you should be picking out wedding dresses for your upcoming nuptials to the guy you met last night; (b) you should break up with someone because they slightly pissed you off; or (c) you should be freaking out about your biological clock. A Mars-Saturn smackdown might encourage you to do something rash, and as we all know rash decisions rarely work out.

"
9428,30 may 2017,sagittarius,"It ain’t easy being sexy and flirtatious, but someone’s gotta do it and it might as well be you! A spontaneous meet up between maverick Uranus and lusty Mars sets the stage for some fun. Grab your honey and have an enjoyable night out on the town. Better yet, call in sick and make it an all-day event.

"
9429,31 may 2017,sagittarius,"Before you dive into a project make sure that you have considered all of the smaller things that need to be done correctly in order to produce a winning outcome. With intelligent Mercury in your meticulous house of efficiency this shouldn’t be a problem. Oh, and you might want to make sure that other people involved know what’e expected of them. Try to maintain the lead in this endeavor.

"
9430,1 june 2017,sagittarius,"If you want it, put a ring on it! Serious Saturn is pushing archers to get real about where a relationship is going. If your union resembles a dog chasing its tail, it may be time to move on. Otherwise it’s a perfect day to discuss what you both want for the future, and that includes those of you already in a marriage. Make sure to schedule more date nights—without the kids!     

"
9431,1 june 2016,sagittarius,"Clouds are forming in the skies, and they cast shadows on your love life–or lack of one! If you have been too busy handling family dramas or chores to put quality time into romance, it will become evident that your needs must be met also. Whether you’re single and caring for an elderly parent, or you’re a stay-at-home mom who can’t keep up with the laundry and the dirty dishes, you’re going to get fed up. When you try to keep everyone else happy, your own contentment may suffer.

"
9432,2 june 2017,sagittarius,"Trying to do everything all by yourself may sound  OK (“if I do it, I know it will be done the right way” or “I don’t feel like dealing with other people and their head trips”). But from your chart it appears that you can get more mileage from collaborating with others than going it alone. Once intelligent Mercury enters your partnership zone next Tuesday you can initiate conversations with movers and shakers.

"
9433,2 june 2016,sagittarius,"What kind of career would make you excited about getting up in the morning? That’s the question today, as a harmonious trine between the Moon and the North Node stirs your curiosity. If you already love what you do, amen. A juicy new assignment could come your way. But if your job is of the soul-sucking (or non-existent!) variety, start thinking of a career that would put a smile on your face.

"
9434,3 june 2017,sagittarius,"Your desire to be involved in more rewarding relationships is on the rise thanks to an energetic meeting of megawatt Uranus and gracious Venus. This holds true for all of your closest connections, from friends and lovers to business alliances. A far more cooperative atmosphere is building in which you can either advance existing unions or create some exciting new ones. If others don’t share your sense of camaraderie, maybe it’s time for some new faces.

"
9435,3 june 2016,sagittarius,"Something’s gotta give, and you’re the one who has to figure out what it is. The demands of your family are starting to catch up with you, along with your job. A Grand Cross in the heavens is pitting your needs against those of the other people around you, and quite frankly, you’re tired of being the go-to girl or guy. It’s time to set boundaries, and with disciplined Saturn in your first house, you will  enforce them and make them stick. The new moon on Sunday falls in your partnership sector, so that’s a good time to demand a fair division of labor and some emotional support.

"
9436,4 june 2017,sagittarius,"Feeling amorous? Lusty Mars charges into your eighth house of libido and intimacy, the place where we share our body and soul with another person. Over the next few weeks you can reboot a relationship that has become somewhat stale or find a new lover, someone with depth. With next week’s full moon occurring in your sign, you’ll definitely be looking out for #1 but this isn’t a problem. You need balance and openness in love, and you should  be demanding it.

"
9437,5 june 2017,sagittarius,"Getting the straight story from people may be impossible today, so don’t waste your time. Unfortunately the perps involved could be people close to you, not just the two-tongued customer service rep at your health insurance company or the DMV. Considering that incendiary Mars just entered one of the most emotional parts of your chart, your best bet is to count to ten and walk away. Don’t worry, you’ll be back on track by Wednesday.

"
9438,6 june 2017,sagittarius,"The couple that plays together stays together? Now that love planet Venus is in your house of fitness and vitality, you and your amour might consider a joint workout. Start running in the morning, take a salsa class together at the gym or sign up for tennis lessons. And what if there is no lover to be found? All the more reason to work out, my friend. Start looking gorgeous for the people you haven’t even met yet, not to mention exacting revenge on an ex.

"
9439,7 june 2017,sagittarius,"You need to develop balance in your life, archer, especially with key relationships. No one should be playing bully or victim. No enabling or being a martyr (and this includes the workplace as much as it does your family). Conversations should be plentiful and frank. The full moon on Friday falls in your sign, so although you’ll be looking out for #1 you also need to consider the needs and plans of others.

"
9440,8 june 2017,sagittarius,"Sometimes we stay in friendships out of habit. We may have changed, and perhaps we’ve outgrown the relationship with another person, but we still stick around. A reflective Jupiter-Neptune aspect today asks you to consider your alliances. If you’re happy with the people in your world, so be it! But frenemies and malcontents will just suck the life out of you. Choose wisely.

"
9441,9 june 2017,sagittarius,"This is one of the most important days of the year for you, Sagittarius! It’s the annual full moon in your sign, which means that you could be wrapping up something of great importance to you. But this lunation is key as serious Saturn is standing nearby. You might make some major decisions within the next few weeks, and whatever you decide to do will have long lasting ramifications. Considering that Saturn is the planet of wisdom and maturity, the changes you make to your life will be based on solid thinking, not the wishful kind.

"
9442,10 june 2017,sagittarius,"It takes two to tango, as the saying goes, and now that Jupiter is moving direct you should be seeing more cooperation with others. The gigantic planet was retrograde in your house of teamwork, friends and networking, not to mention tech ventures. If progress was slow in any of these areas you should now start to see more forward movement. Likewise, if you’ve been operating as a lone ranger, it’s time to start working your connections.

"
9443,11 june 2017,sagittarius,"Focusing on the details just isn’t important over the next few days. As a matter of fact, the only thing you should be thinking about is you. Selfish? Not really. The cosmos is pushing you to focus on your journey ahead, the big picture.

"
9444,12 june 2017,sagittarius,"Leveling with people gets easier today thanks to a helpful Mercury aspect. This is especially true if you need to discuss a long term plan: a romantic commitment perhaps, a business deal,  a contract or your values. Do so today, because the end of the week brings some tough aspects that could make cooperation hard to come by.

"
9445,13 june 2017,sagittarius,"Trying to get a straight answer from someone close may be damn near impossible, so prepare to be patient! Neptune, that watery planet of misinformation, is acting up today. This energy builds as the week goes on, and by Thursday you may be ready to let someone have it. If you need to give someone an ultimatum, so be it. But be prepared to act on it.

"
9446,14 june 2017,sagittarius,"Super day to express not only your thoughts, but your feelings! This is especially true of long term matters of the heart or business. Serious Saturn is in a good spot to help you get your point across. If you need to pull people together to create a productive synergy, do so. You could experience resistance tomorrow, though, so don’t expect instant cooperation.

"
9447,15 june 2017,sagittarius,"No matter how much you may feel like cooperating with others, they may not be in the mood to do the same. So forget the “sharing is caring” business and start looking out for #1. This doesn’t mean that you should be selfish or obnoxious. Instead, merely focus on your own plans, values and dreams. Eventually others will get back on board with you.

"
9448,16 june 2017,sagittarius,"Keep a close eye on home and family related matters until late November, Sagittarius. Confusing Neptune retrogrades in your domestic sector, creating miscommunication and maybe even hurt feelings on your part. Make sure that anyone who works on your home, such as a contractor or housekeeper, knows what their responsibilities are and that their paperwork is in order. You may need to set boundaries with loved ones too, which may not go over well—but so be it.

"
9449,17 june 2017,sagittarius,"Everyone needs a serene place to come home to at night, but archers will be more focused on this than the other signs of the zodiac. That’s because Neptune just began to back stroke through your domestic sector, shining its light on your emotional happiness in addition to the actual warmth, comfort and decor of your abode. If anyone or anything is getting in the way of your sense if peace, it’s time to make some changes.

"
9450,18 june 2017,sagittarius,"Your sign is known for its individualistic streak, but the planets are telling you to be sociable and hang out with others over the next few days. There’s even the chance of some serious partying in your astrological forecast. Serendipity is a part of this, so be open to some interesting surprises!

"
9451,19 june 2017,sagittarius,"We’ve all heard about the 800 pound gorilla in the room–the one that just sits there and doesn’t budge. Well, if you’re feeling like more stubborn than usual, it’s because a Mercury-Saturn smackdown is turning you into that primate! You’re in no mood for compromising, and why should you? Get a banana daiquiri and chill.

"
9452,20 june 2017,sagittarius,"Romance reboot! A sparkling Uranus-Mercury aspect puts some juice back into your union. It’s time to play more and argue less, and it will be up to you to schedule the play time (and the activities). No lover in sight, or your current amour is a dud? Then start hunting for a new love. The Sun’s move into Cancer tomorrow could bring a s sexy soulmate your way.

"
9453,21 june 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in a superb position to rid yourself of mental demons that may be diminishing your experience of life, archer. The Sun has just entered your emotional eighth house, one of the sectors that governs our deepest emotions and feelings. The Sun’s job is to illuminate them. But in a cosmic twist of fate, rational Mercury glides into this sector too, helping you deal with them in an intelligent, drama-free manner.

"
9454,22 june 2017,sagittarius,"Laser-like focus is a gift the cosmos is presenting to you, now that the illuminating Sun and intelligent Mercury are in your eighth house. So dig deep—into your finances, emotions, relationships, spirituality, health issues, whatever needs to be uncovered. This can become an intense exercise, but the results are worth it.

"
9455,23 june 2017,sagittarius,"If your cash flow has been more of a trickle than a flood, cosmic help is on the way. Tomorrow’s new moon is in your net worth sector and it opens up a six-month cycle of greater prosperity. Today is a smart time to take a look at your financial picture and consider new ways of building wealth.

"
9456,24 june 2017,sagittarius,"A wonderfully romantic time can begin in your love life thanks to a luscious new moon in your house of intimacy. However, it won’t be all moonbeams and rose petals, and in a way that’s a good thing. There’s a practical vibe in the air, making this an auspicious time to go over joint finances, household matters and the next steps to take in your union.

"
9457,25 june 2017,sagittarius,"Sparks may fly with someone close, but these are the incendiary kind! Tempers could flare due to a Mars-Jupiter square, so keep your cool. A friend or lover may act out in a jealous or manipulative way, something that’s not going to sit well. Fortunately nurturing Neptune is in a good spot, helping you to maintain some composure.

"
9458,26 june 2017,sagittarius,"Who’s got your back? That’s the question this week as a series of wonky aspects make you wonder. Fortunately your inner mental landscape looks calm and serene thanks to a sweet Mars-Neptune trine. And if your mind isn’t currently in that place, then take time out to meditate and seek wisdom.

"
9459,26 june 2016,sagittarius,"With Mars retrograde over the past two months, you may have been in deep reflection about the path ahead. A magnificent trine between Jupiter and Pluto in the most ambitious part of your chart is superb for career progress. This event won’t happen again till 2024—see how important this is? Pluto is known as the great transformer, so if you’re considering changing careers, opening up your own company or blasting up the ranks at your place of employment—go for it!

"
9460,27 june 2017,sagittarius,"Over the next few weeks you will come to realize that peace and contentment not only come from a happy home life, but within. Moody Neptune is currently retrograde in your house of comfort, urging you to toss out old ways of relating to the people you love–and that includes you!

"
9461,27 june 2016,sagittarius,"The past two months may have felt heavy as you examined negative emotions, toxic ties, and situations that reached their sell-by date long ago. Mars in retrograde motion brought about this reverie, but now that the red planet is direct you can start to make progress—with a much lighter load. Leave the baggage behind and sally forth.

"
9462,28 june 2017,sagittarius,"The archer has their bow and arrows out, ready to take aim and fire. There will be no holding back for you today, not with megamouth Mars meeting up with equally chatty Mercury. Letting your emotions spill is advisable, and you won’t have to rant or reach dramatic heights of filibustering. Just tell it like it is. If people don’t like it, it’s too darn bad.

"
9463,28 june 2016,sagittarius,"Do what you love….and the money will come? That old piece of advice gets tossed around quite a bit, but whether it’s true or not is another issue. With optimistic Jupiter in your career house for the first time in twelve years, it’s not surprising if you are reconsidering your options. And Pluto is asking you to reframe the way in which you earn money. Today you may be thinking long and hard about this. Give yourself time for a solid answer.

"
9464,29 june 2017,sagittarius,"It’s all well and good to be madly in love or passionate about your career or a goal, but practicality has to fit in there too. A tough Pluto-Mercury opposition will remind you of that, so get ready to take your head out of the clouds for a few minutes and get down to basics.

"
9465,29 june 2016,sagittarius,"Keep the mojo in the flow! A happy, serendipitous meeting between the Moon and Uranus in your house of creativity spurs you to get those artistic juices flowing. “But I’m not in a creative line of work!” I hear you saying. Listen, it doesn’t matter if you’re a truck driver, an accountant or a stay-at-home mom. We can all find ways to bring more zest and artistry to our daily lives.

"
9466,30 june 2017,sagittarius,"Big dreams often cost big money, something that you’re going to be keenly aware of over the next few weeks with a building Mars-Pluto opposition. But that’s OK–you’ll be able to figure it out. For now, a luscious Moon-Jupiter aspect encourages you to dream, as Jupiter is the planet of abundance. Where there’s a will there’s a way.

"
9467,1 july 2017,sagittarius,"Hillary Clinton famously said, “It takes a village to raise a child”, and that’s the message from the cosmos to you today, Sagittarius. If you have kids you may need to start relying on the help of others to free up your time and reduce stress, whether it’s a parent or a baby sitter. Even if you’re single or don’t have to worry about child care, your family is in the planets’ crosshairs. Start resolving issues with them now.

"
9468,1 july 2016,sagittarius,"Something is going to happen today that will give you a boost of confidence. Jupiter has been trying to get you to feel comfortable in your own skin for the past ten months, as if you’re standing in your power. Claim it–it’s yours. Don’t worry, you won’t become an egotistical beast. But you will exude an air of contented security that will make others happy to be in your presence, and bring you peace of mind a well.

"
9469,2 july 2017,sagittarius,"With a full moon approaching next weekend in one of your money houses, you may be determined to shore up your financial affairs–a smart move. But make sure that you’re making decisions logically and that they are your own  choices. A harsh Pluto opposition today indicates that someone could try to twist your arm when it comes to spending, earning or investing. Maintain your standards.

"
9470,2 july 2016,sagittarius,"It’s time for a little attitude readjustment! A helpful angle between the Sun and Saturn asks you to reframe your emotions about everything from love to money to family to work. Your emotions may not have been serving you the right way and it’s time to get back on a more positive track. The next two weeks will give you ample opportunities to do a lot of deep thinking and healing.

"
9471,3 july 2017,sagittarius,"Your ability to read between the lines and figure out what’s going on behind the scenes is just plain spooky. At least, it will seem that way to other people. The reality is that the Moon is active in your house of intuition, helping you read the emotions and thoughts of others. Use this to your advantage!

"
9472,3 july 2016,sagittarius,"The new moon tomorrow is excellent for entering into a joint venture or some kind of business arrangement, and today’s Sun-Neptune trine indicates that the family might be involved. Whether they’re actively playing a part or conveniently lending money, their presence can be a benefit. But if your family isn’t a part of this picture, the trine can bring a sense of contentment and security to the venture.

"
9473,4 july 2017,sagittarius,"Stability and peace are going to become more important to you in the weeks ahead, thanks to the approaching full moon on Saturday in your house of security. Venus’s entry today into your house of cooperation and bonding with others will drive it home that your sense of comfort will depend on how well you get along with others…and whether or not they bring happiness or drama into your world.

"
9474,5 july 2017,sagittarius,"It’s time to talk the talk, archer. Chatty Mercury just entered your house of big ideas, so if you are considering an audacious plan you need to have your facts straight, not to mention your finances and any other resources you may need to get going. Current planetary aspects indicate that this week is especially good for housing, family and romantic matters, so talk things over with loved ones.

"
9475,5 july 2016,sagittarius,"This is an excellent day to handle residential and family matters, as Mercury trines Neptune in your house of domestic issues. If there has been confusion or indecision the time is right for talking things over. Even more progress can be made tomorrow.

"
9476,6 july 2017,sagittarius,"Other people may be hell bent on making you feel guilty or jealous, but don’t let them push those buttons. Let their s*** be their s***. With the upcoming full moon falling in your house of healthy self-respect, you don’t have time for taking on someone else’s head games.

"
9477,6 july 2016,sagittarius,"If there was ever a day to hold a deep and meaningful conversation with a lover, this is it. Mars and Venus form a gorgeous angle in the heavens, enabling you to dig deep into your psyche and release old fears, grudges, or concerns. You can also get in touch with the happiest of emotions as well! Singles, you’re not left out. Stale, worn-out feelings of not being good enough, or attracting the wrong kind of lover, can be tossed to to the curb.

"
9478,7 july 2017,sagittarius,"Need to pare back a bit? An overly optimistic attitude on your part could lead to taking on more than you can handle. The good news is that three planets are in your house of taking a chance, diving into new experiences. The downside is that there aren’t enough hours in a day (and other resources) to do them all well! Tomorrow’s full moon will help you trim your list.

"
9479,7 july 2016,sagittarius,"Fiscal responsibility is what it’s all about today, as planets in your money houses are at war. Keep the plastic in your wallet and think twice before taking out loans on expensive items, such as a house, car or boat. A lover or child may act out, making demands about spending. Don’t give in.

"
9480,8 july 2016,sagittarius,"Great day to talk about inking a deal, forming a partnership or entering into a lucrative investment. With talkative Mercury in a helpful angle with Jupiter in your house of power brokers, you can easily bring people over to your way of thinking. Mars is active in your confidentiality sector, though, urging discretion—at least for the time being.

"
9481,9 july 2017,sagittarius,"Material success is not what life is all about, archer, something that you need to remember. Warring planets may find you too focused on making money or building up your net worth. While these are important, so is taking the optimistic view that things will work out. Sometimes you need to step away from something in order to let it grow.

"
9482,9 july 2016,sagittarius,"Nothing is sexier than a person who knows what they want out of life! That kind of single-minded focus adds a certain “je ne sais quoi” to your allure. With the impassioned Moon gliding past advantageous Jupiter today, you’re stepping into a more powerful position. Use it to charm, and disarm!

"
9483,10 july 2017,sagittarius,"You may be worth far more than what you’re currently being paid, so don’t be shy about either asking for more money or traveling down a more lucrative path. Once Mars and the Sun enter Leo later in the month, your options will open up. Keep an open mind about fresh opportunities.

"
9484,10 july 2016,sagittarius,"Sometimes you have to pull away from the madding crowd just to get your thoughts and emotions in perspective. Two superb planetary angles tell you to go within, not just to release the negative stuff but to get in touch with your own power. As shaman Don Matus told author Carlos Castaneda, we all have an inner voice that will lead us to answers and serenity, but it is obscured by all the “noise” we are surrounded by.

"
9485,11 july 2017,sagittarius,"Getting back on the same page with someone (or a group of people) gets easier with the Moon in your third house of eloquent speech. Express your opinions, as other people need to know what’s on your mind. Thursday is an even better day for showcasing your ideas.

"
9486,11 july 2016,sagittarius,"You may be ready to share your deepest thoughts with someone close, but they may not be. A tense aspect between communicative Mercury and unpredictable Uranus indicates that a lover or child may act up today, making you wonder if you’ll ever be able to talk things through. Fortunately, both Venus and Mercury glide into your expansive ninth house this week, helping you view the situation from a higher perspective.

"
9487,12 july 2017,sagittarius,"Structure and discipline often sound pretty gruesome–after all, who wants to be confined to doing things a certain way! But you would be wise to create more routines both at home and at work. With the Moon in your comfort-driven fourth house, the more order you have around you, the more serene you’ll feel.

"
9488,12 july 2016,sagittarius,"Ready to put yourself out there when it comes to romance? Love planet Venus enters your house of taking chances! You’ll be willing to take a gamble on someone new if you’ve been off the market for awhile. On the fence about cohabitating or getting engaged? Your courage and optimism should rise. Coupled archers could consider a more exciting love life, which might mean soul searing sex, a weekly date night, or making plans to go abroad on an exotic adventure. If you’ve been unhappy in love, Venus’s entry into Leo could light a fire under you to seek more independence. One door closes, another one opens!

"
9489,13 july 2017,sagittarius,"Need to have a heart to heart conversation with someone close? Then do so today, as a Neptune-Moon conjunction will help the words flow. Even if the other person isn’t ready to hear what you have to say, you’ve put it out there. How they respond is their issue.

"
9490,13 july 2016,sagittarius,"Go global! The entry of Mercury into your expansive ninth house signals a time of growth. Stop thinking small. Got a local business? Consider going statewide, or even national. Own a brick and mortar store? Then maybe it’s time to take it online as well. If obtaining a higher degree would make you stand out from the rest of the pack, start looking at college curricula. Hiding in the shadows never helped anyone.

"
9491,14 july 2017,sagittarius,"You know what you want and how to get it, thanks to intelligent Mercury in your think-big sector. But you won’t succeed if you try to do it all on your own. As a matter of fact, your greatest chance of success comes from either teaming up with others or seeking the advice of a savvy mentor.

"
9492,14 july 2016,sagittarius,"The cosmos is suggesting that you take a different approach to dealing with the people in your circle, especially children and lovers. Uranus is making them act in unpredictable ways, but with Mars so active in your house of intuition, you’ll be able to get to the root of their behavior without much difficulty. Pay attention to subtle clues.

"
9493,15 july 2017,sagittarius,"Following your head versus your heart is a dilemma that we all face from time to time. In your case, archer, today the heart will win. It’s a good time to open up and let someone know what you think and how you feel. This may make you feel vulnerable, but the end result will be worth it.

"
9494,15 july 2016,sagittarius,"When we watch sports stars, singers and actors perform, or artists who are at the top of their game, it all looks so effortless, doesn’t it? But often times people don’t pay attention to the long hours and discipline that went on behind the scenes. That’s the message the stars have for you, Sagittarius–figure out the routines, habits and positive thought patterns that will help you turn your dreams into reality. Saturn will help them stick.

"
9495,16 july 2017,sagittarius,"They say that sharing is caring, and this is especially true in matters of the heart. But today’s frisky, flirty aspects indicate that you just want to have some fun and not get dragged into deep discussions. Serious talks can wait!

"
9496,16 july 2016,sagittarius,"How high can you fly? With Venus and Mercury in the most adventurous part of your chart, how far you go is up to you. These two meet in the heavens, urging you to consider your options. Deep emotional thoughts may bubble to the surface, but that’s part of the process. When the Sun enters this part of the sky on the 22nd, it’s all systems go.

"
9497,17 july 2017,sagittarius,"Is someone clinging to you like a piece of lint? Or maybe it’s the other way around. Neediness rears its annoying little head today, and someone is going to end up feeling suffocated. There’s a time and place for being emo and today is not one of them. Back off.

"
9498,17 july 2016,sagittarius,"The Moon spends a few fleeting hours in your sign today, but that’s just enough to get you centered on your desires! A happy trine between La Luna and Uranus will spur you to seek out more fun, juicier romance, trying a new sport or heading off to some concerts and art galleries. When the Sun enters Leo this Friday, you’ll be even more motivated to live life to the fullest.

"
9499,18 july 2017,sagittarius,"A more sociable time is about to open up for you once Mars enters Leo on Thursday, but the cosmos is saying–why wait to get the party started? A happy Venus-Jupiter aspect today is perfect for going out to dinner with your friends, not to mention finding a new amour (all the more reason to go out!).

"
9500,18 july 2016,sagittarius,"Our habits run our lives, and they can be difficult to break. That’s why Pluto is around, to point out to us the changes we need to make. Today the dwarf planet asks you to analyze your methods of saving and spending money, in addition to how you earn it. Mercury and Venus are pushing you to go outside your comfort zone and live a bolder life, and that includes your income level. Why think small?

"
9501,19 july 2017,sagittarius,"This is one of the best days of the year to enter into an agreement, sign a contract or commit to a plan that can open up your world in a big way: going to college or night school, for example, or launching an entrepreneurial venture. Don’t dawdle: energetic Mars moves into Leo tomorrow, putting rocket boosters on your plans.

"
9502,19 july 2016,sagittarius,"The money doctor is in the house, and he wants to perform a checkup on your cash flow! The full moon in Capricorn is your key to nailing down a new, higher-paying gig, establishing a budget, and developing thrifty habits that will enable you to save more. But Uranus is in a difficult angle from your house of love and children. The message? Your kids don’t need $300 kicks or the latest electronic gizmo. Spending too much on dating or pleasing a lover is not the way to go. The cosmos isn’t telling you to be cheap, but to carefully consider expenditures. Have fun, yet save money at the same time.

"
9503,20 july 2017,sagittarius,"The future’s so bright, I have to wear shades! That may be your mantra over the next few weeks as megawatt Mars moves into the most optimistic part of your chart. Nothing is going to stop you from going after your heart’s desire.

"
9504,20 july 2016,sagittarius,"You’re known for being the risk taker of the zodiac, Sagittarius, boldly pushing into new territory. But sometimes the most intrepid of explorers gets into a rut. With sober Saturn in your house of self, chances are you’ve been holding back over the past year, opting to play if safe. That’s about to change. Today Saturn greenlights Venus, saying that it’s OK to take your foot off the brake and get some momentum going.

"
9505,21 july 2017,sagittarius,"Your emotions could be more volatile than a gas can with a lit match about to be dropped into it, archer. Unless you want to explode and deal with ensuing dramatic aftermath, it’s time to take a deep breath and maybe pull away from a nerve wracking situation. The good news is that the Sun enters Leo, the most happy-go-lucky part of your chart tomorrow.

"
9506,21 july 2016,sagittarius,"With intelligent Mercury scheduled to enter your career house on the 30th, the chance to showcase your talents is approaching. In order to make the most of this, a Moon-Jupiter angle today suggests that you rework your method of communicating with people in positions of authority. Do you need to respond more quickly to e-mails? Show that you’re a team player? Take a more chill attitude? Figure it out–then put the changes in motion.

"
9507,22 july 2017,sagittarius,"Feeling visionary? You should be now that the Sun is in Leo! It’s time to think about living a more authentic life, even if that means breaking away from the image that others have of you. Don’t hide your light under a bushel.

"
9508,22 july 2016,sagittarius,"Your sign doesn’t like being held down, Sagittarius, and now that the Sun is in frisky Leo, you’ll be ready to charge ahead! How does the title “best-selling author” sound? Or how about “intrepid explorer”, “Ph.D.” or “entrepreneurial whiz”? Now’s the time to stretch past your boundaries.

"
9509,23 july 2017,sagittarius,"With a new moon in Leo, you’re going to want to pursue some interesting challenges and goals, such as going to grad school, starting a business or traveling around the world. But like a kid in a candy shop with a $100 bill in your hand, your eyes may be bigger than your stomach. Be selective about what you dive in to.

"
9510,23 july 2016,sagittarius,"You could find yourself in quite a nostalgic mood as the Moon connects with Neptune in the heavens. Memories from the past, especially those involving women in your family, may bubble up to the surface of your mind. Why not honor these special ladies with a prayer, a meditation practice or by lighting a candle? Pull out some old photos and reminisce.

"
9511,24 july 2017,sagittarius,"Your sign is known for being an ever-optimistic pioneer, and today the cosmos is telling you to pursue your heart’s desire. However, a business or romantic partner may put up resistance, making you feel guilty about the pursuit. This is no time to worry about their expectations; keep moving forward.

"
9512,24 july 2016,sagittarius,"With the Sun now in the most independent, footloose part of your chart, you may be itching for some excitement. Well scratch that itch, Sag! A fun Moon-Sun trine urges you to get out of the house and enjoy some new experiences. Whether it’s trying a new sport, learning a new language, or popping into a restaurant with cuisine from a far off land, the message from the cosmos is to live a little.

"
9513,25 july 2017,sagittarius,"Now that Mercury is in your career and goals sector you can make excellent progress. The only issue is that you may try to take on too much, burning out in the process. You will  need the support of decision makers and authority figures to get ahead, so be diplomatic while you show off your talents and can-do attitude.

"
9514,25 july 2016,sagittarius,"The glittering full moon on the 19th was designed to take your income up a notch–or two or three! You may have already started on the next phase of your wealth building plan, but planetary influences suggest that there could be opposition. No surprise there! People tend to get nervous when they see others hustling. Today a romantic partner could voice their opinions. But it’s also possible that in your desire to make progress you could be neglecting the people you love, like kids and the SO. Maintain balance as you forge ahead.

"
9515,26 july 2017,sagittarius,"This is one of the best days all year to pursue a big plan or dream that has been bouncing around in your mind for way too long. Mars and the Sun meet up in your brainy yet adventurous ninth house, so this is the perfect time to go for it.

"
9516,26 july 2016,sagittarius,"You’ll be inspired to get on top of your workload, whether at home or at the office. With the Moon in the most meticulous, organized part of your chart, inertia will be overcome as momentum builds. Pluto in your income sector is ready to show you more cash, but you need to have solid routines in place beforehand.

"
9517,27 july 2017,sagittarius,"It’s wonderful to have big dreams, but do they really align with your values? And do the people in your world share the same core principles as you? Get straight on this before you charge ahead with your plans.

"
9518,27 july 2016,sagittarius,"Something could spur you into taking a fortuitous chance, and you’ll be glad you did. Say “yes” to a lunch date, the seminar invitation, the trip, the class, the brand new idea. The cosmos is pushing you into a place of change and fresh new adventures and people, but you have to be open to possibilities.

"
9519,28 july 2017,sagittarius,"Are your dreams way bigger than your budget? That may be the case, but it doesn’t mean that your dreams are impossible. Just make sure that anything you decide to go after is your  aspiration. Don’t let jealousy of what other people appear to have to be driving your decisions.

"
9520,28 july 2016,sagittarius,"Tireless Mars is working overtime in your behind-the-scenes sector, creating a laser-like focus that enables you to see the real picture. Which can be good–or bad! Today you’ll suss what’s going on with a work situation. You may realize that clients or colleagues are working at cross purposes to you. However, with lucky Jupiter protecting your back in the career sector, you’re in better shape than you may think.

"
9521,29 july 2017,sagittarius,"You and someone close may not see eye to eye today, but that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t share your feelings. Being open and honest about what you’re thinking will help matters, which could actually start to improve tomorrow.

"
9522,29 july 2016,sagittarius,"You’re an adventurous sort, Sagittarius, but even the most intrepid voyager needs some down time to recharge their batteries. Uranus has just gone retro in your house of fun, love and creativity. No one’s telling you to join the priesthood, but you may want to cut back on social engagements as you spend more quality time with your kids and loved ones. A romantic partner could be indecisive or difficult to read, so patience will be your virtue here.

"
9523,30 july 2017,sagittarius,"Sweet! Amorous Venus has your back, and there could be some unexpected adventures in store for you. So get yourself dolled up and plan on making a splash. Of all the signs of the zodiac, you are the most likely to turn heads today.

"
9525,31 july 2017,sagittarius,"Financial matters begin to ease now that Venus is in your net worth sector.

"
9531,3 august 2017,sagittarius,"Just how much drama do you want in your life? Figure that out stat. If you don’t want much then you’ll need to set some boundaries with the people around you—especially a lover and kids—because erratic Uranus retrogrades today in the sector that governs them.

Then on Wednesday Mars and Saturn shake hands, clarifying what moves you need to make next.

"
9567,23 august 2016,sagittarius,"You’re the envy of the zodiac, archer, as Mars and Saturn are getting ready to meet up in your sign tomorrow. Just about any dream or passion you’d like to go after can be attained, with Saturn helping you make wise choices and Mars lighting a fire under your tush. But tense angles today with neptune and a slew of other planets in Virgo suggest that you need to set some boundaries with both your family and your job before you set things in motion.

And with so many planets in Virgo, your house of authority, you should be feeling stronger and in control. But not everyone is going to agree with your plans and the new can-do attitude. A romantic or business partner may voice their opposition today, and family members could be crotchety on Friday. Please. You can’t live your life living by someone else’s rules.

"
9576,1 september 2016,sagittarius,"A powerful solar eclipse in the most ambitious part of your chart can usher in fast-moving changes that will propel your career and income upward. So why the foot dragging? Blame that on serious Saturn issuing warnings from your house of self-image, saying that you shouldn’t try to go too far too fast. Listen, Saturn is a wise old dude.

The smart archer zips their lips and says little. Red-hot Mars is in your sign, causing you to want to fight back or be quite vocal. Let this pass and wait until the 20th and the 23rd, two excellent days for making progress.

"
9588,13 september 2016,sagittarius,"First, the good news: the fiery Sun is in your career house, aiming to move you upward, while assertive Mars is in your self-esteem sector, helping you feel more confident. Now for the downside: they’re squaring each other today, which is not the best of angles. You run the risk of coming on too strong with an authority figure, or could feel stuck and powerless in a situation that is not to your liking. Wait until the 19th for clarity and forward momentum.

"
9589,14 september 2016,sagittarius,"A sparking aspect between the Moon and Uranus will make it so much easier today to communicate with your kids or a lover.

Don’t worry, you’re not going to lose your mojo. But you could be a lot more interested in the six months ahead to feather your nest, whether that means buying or leasing a new place, redecorating, or moving in with someone. If that includes hearing the pitter patter of little feet, the cosmos might deliver!

"
9592,17 september 2016,sagittarius,"You can’t help it if you’re hot! Or as the commercial used to say, “Don’t hate me because I’m beautiful.” Such a weight to bear, Sagittarius! With lusty Mars in your house of self-image forming a simmering, sexy trine with maverick Uranus, you have no choice but to turn heads and attract admirers. Just don’t rush into a new relationship, especially if you’re still in one.

"
9593,18 september 2016,sagittarius,"To thine own self be true. Listen to your own inner voice, Sagittarius, as the voices of other people may become a little too loud for your taste. Friends may mean well, but when listening to their advice you have to consider what is best for you. An acquaintance may overstep their bounds, providing you with opinions that weren’t solicited.

Next week’s full moon is a turning point in romance: should I stay or should I go? With the Moon in your house of communication, try talking things over first.

"
9672,9 december 2016,sagittarius,"You’re on the verge of making some major life decisions as the Sun moves closer to lining up with Saturn on Saturday. Today provides you with the opportunity to crystallize your plans, as abundant Jupiter is active in your house of deeply held wishes. One thing’s for sure—you’re stepping into a place where you feel more powerful and in control. Don’t let anything stand in your way.

"
9673,10 december 2016,sagittarius,"It may still be your birthday season in the cosmos, but it won’t be all champagne, confetti and chocolate cake. Today the planets take a more serious turn, but this is a good thing. Saturn, the planet of long-term planning, meets up with the Sun in your sign, which will have huge ramifications on your future. These two are holding a power lunch to discuss the steps you’re going to take next in your path through life and it’s time to make some big decisions. Whatever you decide to do, Saturn will give the discipline and logic to see through to the very end. Choose what needs to say and what has to go.

"
9674,11 december 2016,sagittarius,"Want more serenity? You don’t have to buy dream catchers, crystals and incense. Nor do you need to chant mantras as you gaze at your navel. No, the cosmos has far more practical advice for you today: establish better, smarter routines. The good thing about good habits is that we kind of get into automatic pilot with them, freeing up our brains so that we can just chill. Want mind like water? Then your chores and responsibilities need to flow.

"
9675,12 december 2016,sagittarius,"Love is in the air, but which way is the wind blowing? The skies are changeable thanks to rebellious Uranus acting up. Over the next few days you may question which direction to head in when it comes to a romantic alliance: split up? Get married? Have another baby? Date that new person who’s caught your eye? Don’t make any fast decisions with the full moon falling in your commitment sector tomorrow. Give it time.

"
9676,13 december 2016,sagittarius,"Some of the biggest decisions you’ll ever make in life are about the people you surround yourself with, and today’s full moon in Gemini forces you to examine close ties. If someone isn’t adding joy to your life, or if they’re not supportive of you, why are you involved with them? Sharing the same values is also key, and this lunation shines its light on what’s most important to you. Whether you remain or decide to go, know that wise old Saturn has your back.

"
9677,14 december 2016,sagittarius,"It’s one thing to be friendly and outgoing, another to be too open to hanging out with anyone who’s around! Be discriminate about the company you keep these days, archer. Between now and next October you can meet a number of interesting, vibrant people who can become friends (or lovers!) for life. However, a tough aspect today indicates that you need to be choosy. This isn’t about being an elitist but instead a good judge of character.

"
9678,15 december 2016,sagittarius,"Every hurricane has a calm center known as the eye, and that’s where you need to be today, metaphorically speaking! People around you seem to have their knickers in a twist, being unsure of what they’re doing. Or worse—they seem determined to push your buttons. If you react, you’ll get sucked into their dramas faster than you can say “quicksand”. Don’t get involved.

"
9679,17 december 2016,sagittarius,"Cue Abba, circa 1978: “Take a chance on me!”  That’s your motto today as the Moon enters the most adventurous part of your chart. Ask someone out on a date, ask for the order, sign up for adult ed classes, take a gamble that you can do something else for a living. Don’t worry, the decisions you make will be grounded. Mars enters your house of security on Monday, so you won’t do anything too rash.

"
9680,18 december 2016,sagittarius,"Filters, please! Watch what you say with the emotional Moon opposing aggressive Mars. What you consider to be an honest opinion or objective observation could be taken quite differently by the recipient. Save important conversations for the 25th, which serves up not just one but three fabulous planetary aspects for communicating with your tribe.

"
9681,19 december 2016,sagittarius,"Money talks and it’s telling you to slow your roll. Mercury retrogrades in your house of earning, spending and saving money. Need I say more? Just because something’s on sale doesn’t mean that you should buy it. Holiday gifts spending shouldn’t be over the top. As a matter of fact, when the Sun enters capricorn on Wednesday, it will encourage you to start saving for home-related expenses. Think about long term assets rather than instant gratification.

"
9682,20 december 2016,sagittarius,"A strong, healthy sense of self-worth often comes from enjoying financial security and that’s what the cosmos wants to give you. But this isn’t about winning a lottery or becoming a reality TV star. Sorry—you’ll have to work for it! But it will only add to your self esteem as you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing that you did it on your own.

"
9683,21 december 2016,sagittarius,"With the Sun now in the house of earnings you can make huge strides when it comes to seeing more cash. Get the ball rolling now and don’t let the holidays get in your way, as the week after Christmas has one super aspect after another for earning more dinero. The new moon on the 29th kicks open doors that may have been closed in the past. Make sure you’re ready to walk through them.

"
9684,22 december 2016,sagittarius,"Figuring out whom to trust can be dicey this week. Your friends may be saying one thing, your lover another and your intuition yet something else. Perhaps it isn’t that these folks can’t be trusted, but that there’s too much information coming at you from too many sources. The new moon on the 29th will help you get grounded and figure out your next step.

"
9685,23 december 2016,sagittarius,"Motivation to resolve a family or housing issue may rise, a smart move before the holidays. The 25th brings three super Venus aspects that will enable you to communicate freely with loved ones, from friends to kids to your amour. There may have been some drama lately in close relationships, but that should start to dissipate after Uranus goes direct on the 29th.

"
9686,24 december 2016,sagittarius,"It’s time to make some serious decisions about the direction you’re heading in. Whether it’s love, lifestyle or career, a more exciting, creative way of life is calling your name. The question is: are you listening? The new moon on the 29th will help set you on the right path.

"
9687,25 december 2016,sagittarius,"The lines of communication are open wide with charismatic Venus in your house of self-expression. Today the golden girl of the solar system is pushing hard to find you new friends and perhaps even a lover, so by all means reach out to people and make plans! You couldn’t ask for better aspects than this at holiday time when so many people are socializing. Be a social butterfly this week.

"
9688,26 december 2016,sagittarius,"They say that people make the world go ’round, but today you may feel like pulling away from the madding crowd. A rare Jupiter-Uranus opposition could put you in the middle of dramas starring your friends and lover, and the problem is that you won’t be able to keep everyone happy. It’s time to become more selective about the company you keep. As we grow personally, there may be some connections that don’t match who you’ve become. Keep that in mind.

"
9689,27 december 2016,sagittarius,"No one likes controversy but you seem to be surrounded by it as friends and loved ones are acting out. The good news is that you can find contentment among the squabbling. The best way to go about it is to remove yourself mentally from the dramas, to the best of your ability at least. This is one of those times when you just have to let people figure things out for themselves.

"
9690,28 december 2016,sagittarius,"You need to get real about your money situation and fortunately the cosmos intends to help you. A new moon tomorrow in your income and savings sector is the ticket to becoming more solvent in 2017. With Mars in your house of security, comfort and family you’ll be highly motivated to do so. And with Uranus going direct in your house of skills and talent, it’s time to polish them up so that they become more valuable.

"
9691,29 december 2016,sagittarius,"Just in time for 2017: a new moon in your income sector, opening up several weeks of opportunity in which you can rally hustle. The energy of a new moon is strongest in the two weeks that follow it but extends out six months, so between  now and the end of June you can take a quantum leap in your career. Why wait til next week to get moving? Start researching your options now. With Uranus moving direct today you can really showcase your skills.

"
9692,30 december 2016,sagittarius,"If you’ve been struggling with an endless battle between work demands and your family life, a solution may present itself. Yesterday’s new moon was in your income sector, so think differently about your occupation and how you might be able to switch things up in 2017 so that you’ll have more free time–not only for the people you love, but for yourself too.

"
9693,31 december 2016,sagittarius,"Uranus is making you impatient to plunge into projects, especially the fun kind! But methodical Saturn tells you to slow down a bit. You’ll still be able to pursue what your heart yearns for, so have no fear. It’s just that right now you have to take care of more practical concerns. Once they’re out of the way you’ll have more time for enjoyment.

"
9694,1 january 2017,capricorn,"With so much planetary action going down in your house of brilliant thinking and self-expression, 2017 is your year to shout it from the mountaintops! Shamelessly self promote yourself, go viral, write that book, socialize, and pull your art portfolio together. Just make sure that you’re working with a solid plan and not flying by the seat of your pants.

"
9695,2 january 2017,capricorn,"Even a sturdy goat can run out of steam as it’s climbing the mountaintop, and it looks like it’s time for you to take a breather. With optimistic Jupiter in your house of ambition and success for the first time in over a decade, you’ve been working hard for months now. Despite the fact that 2017 just began and maybe you’re anxious to attack your resolutions, chill out a bit and rest up between now and Saturday.

"
9696,3 january 2017,capricorn,"Over the next few weeks you’ll be able to sell ice cream to Eskimos, Capricorn, now that charismatic Venus has entered your communication sector. Not only is this an excellent time to connect on a deeper level with a lover, but the world in general. Any means that you have at your disposal to express yourself should be taken out, polished off and disseminated: your resume, buzz reel, a blog post that you want to go viral, your thesis or your art portfolio. This is no time to wait for recognition.

"
9697,4 january 2017,capricorn,"One of the most powerful aspects of the year is coming your way on Saturday: the meeting of influential Pluto and the Sun. They hold a powwow in your sign, making this a breakthrough day for taking charge of your life. The smart Capricorn spends some quiet time this week in deep reflection beforehand, considering all of their options and the best strategy. When Mercury retrogrades into your secluded twelfth house today, it will provide you with the opportunity to think intelligently about the next twelve months and strategize accordingly.

"
9698,5 january 2017,capricorn,"Of all the signs of the zodiac, you are probably the most driven to succeed right now, Capricorn. And there’s nothing wrong with that as long as you don’t lose sight of a few simple things. Like: joy, comfort, quality time, loved ones and nurturing yourself. An emotional Moon-Uranus convo today encourages you to find some time for them. Don’t view them as a “treat”, but as a necessity.

"
9699,6 january 2017,capricorn,"Take out the trash! From your mind, that is. With Mercury retrograde until Sunday in the sector that governs your subconscious mind, it’s time to stop the pity parties and any other nonproductive activities going on in that brain of yours. It may not be easy, but with disciplined Saturn, the planet that helps us create good habits, in the same part of the sky you can make some serious progress.

"
9700,7 january 2017,capricorn,"Look out world! There’s a new goat in town, and this one will have as much mojo as Moses parting the Red Sea. Capricorn, you are in one hot smokin’ situation today as the two most powerful orbs in the solar system, the Sun and Pluto, meet up in your sign. Talk about stepping into your power! It’s time to focus like a laser beam on what it is that you’d like to achieve and leave the trolls, naysayers and dramas of the past behind you. I almost pity whomever is foolish enough to get in your way. Your ability to influence others in a positive way will be there, along with a burning desire on your part to move ahead. Get going!

"
9701,8 january 2017,capricorn,"Despite the fact that the Sun has been in your sign for weeks, dousing you with charisma and a can-do attitude, you still may have been in a bit of a funk. Mercury has been retrograde in your moody twelfth house of the subconscious mind, but say “hallelujah”, it goes direct today. Actually this interlude may have helped you recognize the negative thought patterns that you need to toss in 2017 in order to move ahead. Which you will, my friend, because Mercury enters Capricorn on Thursday!

"
9702,9 january 2017,capricorn,"Someone could try to push your buttons today, Capricorn, but this person and their battle isn’t worth it. This vibe continues into Wednesday, so keep your mental focus on you, your work and the things that matter to you the most. You have so much positive energy going on in your house of thinking, writing and creative self-expression that it would a waste of your precious chi  to expend it on malcontents.

"
9703,10 january 2017,capricorn,"Don’t tread on me! That’s going to be your motto over the next few days as people in your orbit may try to cajole, coerce or guilt you into doing things their way. Good luck. With two of the most powerful orbs in the solar system, Pluto and the Sun, together in your sign you won’t be suffering fools gladly. Just keep on doing your thing and let the malcontents stew on the sidelines.

"
9704,11 january 2017,capricorn,"Your personal power is growing, Capricorn, and today a terrific Mars-Pluto aspect sharpens your intellect—and maybe your tongue too! But the other person looks like they have it coming. One of the problems with being a Cap is that people take your hard work ethic for granted, and today you may become aware of that. If someone needs to be put in their place, do so (diplomatically) without a speck of remorse. Any roadblocks that get in your way need to be removed right now, and that includes people with expectations that you owe them something.

"
9705,12 january 2017,capricorn,"You might need to slow your roll as some key decisions must be made. Today’s full moon in Cancer is surrounded by a grand cross, which means that planets are tugging and pulling on each other. This will affect your ability to make wise choices; or, make you feel as though you can’t give all areas of your life the attention they deserve. It will be your needs versus a partner’s, your career and goals versus your family life and taking some downtime for yourself. Fortunately smart little Mercury zips into Capricorn today, helping illuminate the path ahead.

"
9706,13 january 2017,capricorn,"With so much planetary firepower in recent weeks pushing you to go after your ambitions, you may have forgotten what it’s like to just have a good conversation with others.Take some time out this weekend to slow down a bit, have some fun and get some things off your mind. Share your ideas, whether it’s with a close friend or just a blank sheet of paper. There is wisdom inside of you–let it out.

"
9707,14 january 2017,capricorn,"Ready to start cashing in on your hard effort? Recent planetary aspects have made you more driven than the other 11 signs, and no doubt you’ve been busy—probably too much so. Intelligent Mercury just entered your sign on Thursday, turning you into a pro at negotiating and putting on a dazzling self presentation. Get your ducks in a row, Capricorn, because the Sun enters your house of making mo’ money next week. There will be a new moon here on the 27th, kicking open doors. Between now and the end of July you should see more green in your wallet.

"
9708,15 january 2017,capricorn,"Great minds produce great ideas, and your brain has been firing on all cylinders lately. The problem is that you may have become so mired in details and trying to figure out what to do next that you can’t see the big picture. The fog will clear by Wednesday at which time you’ll get a better handle on your plan of action.

"
9709,16 january 2017,capricorn,"Tunnel vision? You may have been a victim of it over the past few weeks as the cosmos has been pushing you to achieve your goals. Which is OK, but your sign especially runs the risk of becoming so focused that you forget that there’s a great big world out there. Today a sparkling Moon-Pluto aspect reminds you to stop and smell the roses. Make some plans to travel, relax, hang with friends and enjoy life.

"
9710,17 january 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to change your talk–not only what you say to others, but the self-talk that goes on in your mind. Being harsh on yourself or resorting to pity parties has no place in your life right now. As Buddha said, “What we think, we become.” So do you want to be more serene? Then take your thoughts to that place.

"
9711,18 january 2017,capricorn,"Cha-ching! The Sun is just about to enter your house of making a lot more money on Thursday where it will remain for four weeks. The smart goat gets moving today with self-promotion, drawing up action plans, refining proposals and considering the way they present themselves. With look-at-me Mars in your house of self-expression, make sure that your appearance and attitude are up to snuff.

"
9712,19 january 2017,capricorn,"Discretion is the greater part of valor, words that you would be wise to listen to today. Over the next week or so it’s critical to say as little as possible, especially via text, e-mail or on social media. Keep your opinions to yourself and protect your ideas as though they re precious gems—because they are  valuable. Some snarky Saturn energy suggests that there are malcontents in your midst, people who are word-twisters and idea stealers. They won’t be disappearing anytime soon, but as long as your lips are zipped you have nothing to fear.

"
9713,20 january 2017,capricorn,"Gotta love it. The Sun is now in your prosperous second house, the place where we earn (and save!) mucho dinero. And one of your best assets is assertive Mars, blazing a path through the third house of thinking, strategizing, writing, lecturing, negotiating and self-promotion. The red planet will only be here till the 28th, so make haste.

"
9714,21 january 2017,capricorn,"Need to make amends with a friend? Or perhaps they need to apologize to you. The lines of communication can open wide today with help from the cosmos. You’re in a situation in which you want more guarantees out of life, so flaky or unreliable pals aren’t acceptable, not to mention frenemies. Today, Sunday and Tuesday sparkle for holding meaningful conversations with others.

"
9715,22 january 2017,capricorn,"Slow down and take a few steps back. That’s the message the cosmos has for you today, Capricorn, as the Moon has entered the most reflective part of your chart. Are you going about things the right way? Should you switch up your methods, whether it’s the way you try to communicate with someone, exercise, or market your company? With a new moon coming on Friday in the sector that deals with smart systems, a bit of thought now can pay off handsomely in the future.

"
9716,23 january 2017,capricorn,"Keep your cards close to your vest! Your intuition may be right on target about a person or a situation, which certainly is helpful, but you may realize that someone has ulterior motives. Say nothing and remain vigilant. You won’t have to keep your opinions to yourself forever–just for now. Besides, sometimes you just need to let somebody’s karma catch up with them. Why tip them off?

"
9717,24 january 2017,capricorn,"Got a message you want to share? Whether it’s a conversation with your kids, writing a book or kicking off a marketing campaign, the next few days are stellar for self-expression. It’s also a smart time to just sit back and do a lot of thinking. With the illuminating Sun, transformative Pluto and quick witted Mercury all in the sector that governs your self-image and the things that are closest to your heart, it’s a good time for reflection and reconsidering your plans for the future.

"
9718,25 january 2017,capricorn,"This is a “wow!” of a Wednesday, Capricorn. A superb meet up of the passionate moon, metamorphic Pluto and quick witted Mercury will enable you to develop a better understanding of what makes you tick—which you can then use to your advantage. Some call this “enlightenment”, others call it common sense. Whatever. With so many planets in intelligent, action-taking sectors this additional insight will help you enormously in the weeks and months ahead.

"
9719,26 january 2017,capricorn,"It’s crucial to remain realistic about your ambitions and plans, and today it’s advised that you slow down and think about them. Optimistic Jupiter is in your goals sector, which can possibly make you take on too many projects or have expectations that they will manifest faster than is possible. Venus, in your house of strategizing and thinking, will help you get real without it being a painful process! Mind you, these two planets govern profits among other things, so being pragmatic about money is key.

"
9720,27 january 2017,capricorn,"Gotta love it when hard work finally pays off, and that’s what you’re going to witness over the next six months, Capricorn! A new moon in your income sector kicks open a new phase in which you can start seeing results from the things you’ve been working on. From your chart it appears that you may have been working on projects quietly, behind the scenes. Or maybe you’ve been listening to your own inner wisdom rather than the advice of others. If that’s the case you’re on the right track. Learning how to self-promote is one of the things you’ll need to finesse over the next few months, so pay attention to marketing and branding.

"
9721,28 january 2017,capricorn,"You’ve been working pretty hard without much of a break since late 2016, Capricorn, and yesterday’s new moon in your income sector indicates that the pace isn’t going to let up any time soon. And today assertive Mars moves into your house of family and home, meaning that in addition to a heavy work load you may also have to shoulder responsibilities with the family unit. It’s also possible that you may decide to move, remodel or redecorate your place. A balancing act is going to be necessary, otherwise the weight of all of these tasks could grind you down, making you one cranky goat. Tomorrow is a good day for considering how to handle this.

"
9722,29 january 2017,capricorn,"It’s time for a brief time out, Capricorn. The planets have been pushing you since mid-December to go after your aspirations and they’re not letting up, especially not with Friday’s new moon in your house of making a lot more money. But today it would be wise to take a few minutes to reassess the direction you’re heading in, no matter what your dreams might be. Pluto is asking you to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of a plan and make adjustments. Do that, then get back to the process of world domination.

"
9723,30 january 2017,capricorn,"Just how much should you let on? Sometimes it’s wiser to say little and observe more. Today’s a good time to be as absorbent as a sponge. Your sign is known for being direct, but if you have  to say something you might want to cloak your words carefully. Does that include flattery and schmoozing? Hell, yeah! Just keep it to a minimum.

"
9724,31 january 2017,capricorn,"Over the next two months your determination to create a more peaceful, contented life will increase, whatever that means to you: saving more money, feeling less stressed about work or family obligations, or creating a beautiful home as examples. But despite your best efforts, something or someone may get in the way today. Maybe it’s your own fears or concerns, or perhaps it’s resistance from others. Remember, your body and mind are a temple—treat them that way. Nothing should soil them.

"
9725,1 february 2017,capricorn,"Too many tasks, not enough time. You may be the hardest working sign of the zodiac, always willing to take on more responsibility, but even a goat’s back can be broken from too much weight. Frustration is mounting about all of the undone things on your to-do list, causing stress. Chin up, Capricorn! Help is on the way come the 6th when Jupiter retrogrades in your house of ambition. The pace will slow down, your blood pressure will drop and you might actually be able to carve out time just for enjoyment.

"
9726,2 february 2017,capricorn,"Your sign is known for following tradition, but the cosmos says that it’s time to bust out of an old familiar groove and jazz things up a bit. Luckily Mars is in your house of creativity, so there should be no shortage of fresh ideas coming your way. Yes, you have a lot on your plate, but doing things the same old way can make you feel like a hamster on a wheel. It’s time to start feeling like a peacock instead!

"
9727,3 february 2017,capricorn,"Your emotional state is the focus of the cosmos this month, the aim being to heal and feel more serene. Fortunately, gentle Venus enters your house of contentment today for an unusually long stay. Start the healing process by thinking about past dramas, especially those from childhood or within your family now. Start letting them go as the lunar eclipse on the 10th is designed to exorcise fear, jealousy or resentment. You have places to go and new people to meet—who needs to drag any baggage along on the journey?

"
9728,4 february 2017,capricorn,"With La Luna in the most high spirited part of your chart this weekend you, of all the signs, should be out there cutting loose. Flirt, party, shop, get a massage, dine well, and enjoy cultural pursuits and sporting events. This is just the appetizer of the main course, which is Jupiter going retrograde on Monday. Once the gas giant begins to back stroke you can slow down in your relentless pursuit of achievement.

"
9729,5 february 2017,capricorn,"We all have habitual thought patterns. Some of them serve us well, others don’t. The cosmos is urging you to clear out confusion, denial and anything else that may be clouding your vision. Fortunately, pragmatic Mercury will be entering your second house of routines on Tuesday, which also governs dignity and self-esteem. It’s time to feel bigger than your circumstances.

"
9730,6 february 2017,capricorn,"What appears to be a problem could actually be a benefit in disguise! Mighty and abundant Jupiter begins to back stroke in the heavens today, forcing you to slow down and examine all of your goals and ambitions. As long as you take the long view you’ll be fine, Capricorn, as this four-month retrograde period can help you zero in on the best way to get ahead. An added benefit is Mercury’s entry into Aquarius tomorrow, your second house of ritual, routine and making mo’ money. Study your habits and methods while you dig up new ways to add to your bottom line. Then get ready to see major progress in early June with all of your passion projects.

"
9731,7 february 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to inject some feng shui into your life now that intelligent, organized Mercury has entered your house of simplicity and routines. Considering that Jupiter went retrograde yesterday in your ambition sector, the cosmos is telling you that maintaining solid daily habits is the way to go, rather than just focusing on the end game. Process is now more important than the grand finale.

"
9732,8 february 2017,capricorn,"Powerhouse Pluto has been in your sign for some years now, challenging you to transform your life so that it resembles your ideal. Naturally this often requires an attitude adjustment on your part, which may not always be accepted by the people around you. If you need to pull away from certain folks or set bigger boundaries, do so. Tomorrow and Friday are excellent for establishing new rules, and restoring your dignity in the process.

"
9733,9 february 2017,capricorn,"Contentment and happiness are not the same thing. Happiness tends to come with experiencing certain events–getting engaged, graduating from college–but it doesn’t always last. Contentment, on the other hand, is a deep seated sense of security, feeling at ease with your life today  for no apparent reason. The cosmos is helping you develop that sense of security in a series of aspects that will take place over the next three days. Pay attention.

"
9734,10 february 2017,capricorn,"Sex and money! Want more of both—even just one? Well, you’re in luck, Capricorn. The ancients placed financial wealth in the same house as intimacy back in the day, and tonight there will be a sparkling lunar eclipse in this part of your chart. This could be a game changer as eclipses act quickly and often without warning, speeding up our plans and activities. As a result, a financial project that you’ve been working on could pick up steam, delivering a healthy payday your way. Matters of the heart can also gain momentum. Singles, you could fall fast and hard for a new flame and coupled goats could witness the beginning of a luscious new sexual chapter in their love life. There will be a number of eclipses in this sector all the way through 2019, so this is just the appetizer.

"
9735,11 february 2017,capricorn,"Last night’s lunar eclipse fell in one of your money houses–the big  money sector. As in wealth. And fortunately for you, the illuminating Sun meets up today with profit-generating Jupiter, a highly auspicious aspect for making progress. This is no time for remaining in a dead end job or being passed over for promotions and higher pay. You don’t ask, you don’t get.

"
9736,12 february 2017,capricorn,"Not sure how to get your message out there? Whether you’re trying to market your brand, impress a potential client, or convince a family member to see things a different way, you could be facing obstacles in the early part of the week. A Moon-Neptune opposition creates confusion, but not to worry. Once the powerful Sun enters Pisces next weekend the fog will lift and you will be able to communicate with ease.

9737,13 february 2017,capricorn,"The cosmos has your brain firing on all cylinders and today you may be thinking about how to earn more money. This is a thought that won’t be going away soon as this energy lasts through the end of next week. You may need to switch up your vision of what you’d like to see happen, but this doesn’t mean settling. On the contrary, the planets are trying to create a far more secure situation for you.

"
9738,14 february 2017,capricorn,"The sturdy goat has been working its little tail off as of late, and as a result you may be too worn out for grand gestures on Valentine’s Day! But pull yourself together and get a little romance going. Of all the signs of the zodiac, you have the most planets in stable, secure houses when it comes to love. You won’t be looking for someone to merely party with. This is serious soulmate territory, so make sure that you’re involved with someone who fits that bill.

"
9739,15 february 2017,capricorn,"In your never ending quest to make headway up that mountain (or that career ladder), Capricorn, don’t forget to stop and smell the roses. Mars, now in your cozy house of domesticity, is pushing you to take some much-deserved down time for yourself and your loved ones. You’re about to enter a very social period so tear yourself away from your to-do list, at least for a little while.

"
9740,16 february 2017,capricorn,"Adding more structure to your daily life is advised by the cosmos, especially at home base. If your routine is streamlined there, and your environment is organized and conducive to peace, this will carry with you as you go about your day. Make the effort to get as pulled together as possible.

"
9741,17 february 2017,capricorn,"A true friendship is based on mutual respect, among other things, so if an acquaintance isn’t being kind to you you may need to pull away for a bit. Jackie Kennedy was famous for giving malcontents the cold shoulder rather than reaming them out, so a pal may need to feel a distinct “chill in the air” if they’ve been difficult. With so much planetary activity in your house of dignity, make sure that you maintain yours.

"
9742,18 february 2017,capricorn,"Put your money where your mouth is! The Sun has been in your income sector for the past four weeks, helping you come up with ideas for making more money. Now that it has moved on your quick thinking and smooth talking house of communication, you can start talking turkey. Schedule job interviews, ask for a raise, make presentations to bankers and clients, and research new income streams. Next week is stellar for making progress.

"
9743,19 february 2017,capricorn,"The week ahead is super for talking turkey, so start planning today how you can make (and save) more money. Then hit the ground running on Monday with your ideas, whether that means lining up interviews or quietly researching an entrepreneurial idea that’s been bubbling in your head. Next week’s solar eclipse is a terrific opportunity to self-promote; get your marketing materials and your pitch ready.

"
9744,20 february 2017,capricorn,"The planets are aiming to bring you peace of mind, Capricorn, whatever that means to you. For some it’s financial relief, for others it’s an improvement in their health. The smartest thing you can do right now is to review your habits and routines and see where you can improve them. Taking ownership of your own serenity is what it’s all about.

"
9745,21 february 2017,capricorn,"Your ability to take a step back and analyze your plans with a cool, objective eye will take you much further than you may realize, Capricorn. You may feel as though you’re losing valuable time by taking a more measured approach but according to the cosmos, it’s the smart way to go right now. Keep this in mind tomorrow when a tense Mars-Pluto square could stir up your more ego-driven side.

"
9746,22 february 2017,capricorn,"Take it easy there, Capricorn. Someone may get in your face and try to get you to do things their way, and chances are you’ll rebel. Or is it you who’s stomping your feet and demanding action? It won’t work so don’t even try. Your goal today is to be non-judgmental and just focus on your own little world.

"
9747,23 february 2017,capricorn,"It’s always smart to seek advice from experts, but sometimes your own inner wisdom is the best source of all. Mature, stable Saturn is active in the house of the subconscious mind, helping you to create a life that’s truly yours. A greater sense of dignity and self-confidence are on the way, provided you pay attention to what your gut is telling you.

"
9748,24 february 2017,capricorn,"There’s nothing wrong with following your material desires as long as you (a) don’t go broke in the process and (b) the things you purchase add to a sense of comfort and beauty. We’re not talking about over-the-top retail therapy here; rather, creating a beautiful home environment that makes you feel serene and happy. Venus is in your domestic sector, encouraging you to live well within your budget.

"
9749,25 february 2017,capricorn,"Now that clever Mercury is in your house or brainstorming, you’ll have no shortage of bright ideas. The problem is that you may have too many, so select the ones that really float your boat. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse in the same sector is the perfect time to launch them.

"
9750,26 february 2017,capricorn,"OK, Capricorn, it’s decision time. Get off the fence and do some of those things you’ve been thinking about doing. Today’s solar eclipse in your house of self-expression tells you to write that book, go back to school, learn Photoshop, get serious about a social media campaign or strategize with savvy experts. There is a strong social vibe here; the more people you speak with, the better informed you’ll be.

"
9751,27 february 2017,capricorn,"The ancient Taoists believed that “home” was your own inner world, a place of calm and peace that you took everywhere. That no matter where you were, you were “home”–that is, if you had learned how to be centered and in the flow. That’s a concept you’ll need to consider today as the two most stubborn and hot-headed planets–Mars and Uranus–meet up in your house of home. From your chart it appears that you need to get back in touch with that inner place of contentment.

"
9752,28 february 2017,capricorn,"A battle is brewing in your brain as one part says, “Keep pushing forward!” while the other just wants to plop on the couch and watch Netflix. You’re not a perpetual motion machine, Capricorn. Even long-life batteries need to be recharged. Not to mention that you’re probably overthinking things, thanks to the recent solar eclipse in your mental third house. Carve out more down time for yourself.

"
9753,1 march 2017,capricorn,"Vision boards, affirmations, positive thinking—all of these traditional self-help techniques may sound a bit….foreign to you, Capricorn! You’re a practical soul, and a traditional one at that. You may therefore have a hard time letting go and doing some creative visualization. But the cosmos urges you to let go of the old ways of doing things and try some new techniques. Don’t worry—you’re still going to work hard. No other sign recognizes the value of well-placed effort better than yours.

"
9754,2 march 2017,capricorn,"Feeling a little cranky, Capricorn? That will definitely happen when you don’t set aside enough time for yourself. A difficult opposition today between Jupiter and Uranus, the first of its kind in 14 years, is lighting a fire inside of you to take better care of #1. All work and no play is making for one extremely burned out goat. The trick is to continue pursuing your ambitions while taking the time to stop and smell the flowers.

"
9755,3 march 2017,capricorn,"Make a vow to spend some time on the more enjoyable things in life. A happy Moon-Pluto connection asks you to live life with more creativity and artistry. Pluto is the planet of metamorphosis and it’s in your house of culture, hobbies, sports and having fun—by yourself and with other people. You need to smile more often.

"
9756,4 march 2017,capricorn,"Touchy, touchy! The mighty goat might start looking like a prickly cactus tree over the next month, thanks to Venus retrograding. Your emotions could be raw as people push your buttons. Likewise, old memories (especially family ones) may come bubbling to the surface, bringing unresolved feelings with them. Your security within a romantic relationship may also feel threatened. The question is: are there really problems there, or are you being ultra sensitive? Think before you emote.

"
9757,5 march 2017,capricorn,"Simplify. If there was ever a time to “feng shui” your life it’s right now, Capricorn. From your chart is appears that your mind needs to destress. One of the best ways to do that is to live in a less cluttered home, be involved in fewer activities and make peace of mind not an option.

"
9758,6 march 2017,capricorn,"Your brain is on fire this week, Capricorn! Brilliant ideas abound. Today rocks with a super Sun-Mercury meet up, so use it to your advantage. You can also multitask, chat people up and get your message out there on social media and regular marketing channels.

"
9759,7 march 2017,capricorn,"Am I right, or am I right? Your gut feelings about someone’s behavior or agenda is on target, Capricorn. This may cause unease, especially if it’s a close connection. With Venus retrograde, though, you may be more sensitive than usual. As the week progresses the lines of communication open and you should be able to say what’s on your mind. If they don’t want to listen, then that’s their issue.

"
9760,8 march 2017,capricorn,"If there was ever a time for “rebranding” yourself, it’s now, Capricorn. This term is usually associated with people who own their own business, but the cosmos urges all  goats to rethink their self-image. It’s not only the clothes you wear or your hairstyle, but the way you think and speak, not to mention what you do for a living and the people you associate with. The full moon on the 12th kicks open many doors—get ready to walk through them.

"
9761,9 march 2017,capricorn,"Ready for romance? Juicier, more amorous escapades could be coming your way now that Mars is in your house of love.

Recharge your batteries and savor the sweeter side of life.

"
9762,10 march 2017,capricorn,"Should you be channeling your energy and passion in a different direction? With so much planetary activity in your mental third house, it wouldn’t be surprising if you are thinking this way. And you’re smart to do so. Sunday’s full moon falls in the most open-minded part of your chart. Consider new options in all areas of your life, from love to career to hobbies.

"
9763,11 march 2017,capricorn,"“Drama reduction” is the goal today, Capricorn! People around you may be looking for your advice, but it’s one thing to lend an ear and another to let their crazy circumstances disrupt your day—or serenity. The same holds true for romance. If your partner is hell bent on creating a scene, let them know in no uncertain terms that you don’t appreciate it.

"
9764,12 march 2017,capricorn,"It’s blue skies ahead, Capricorn! A happy full moon in your creative, adventurous ninth house encourages you to take a cherished idea and run with it—no matter what other people think. Pluto is in an excellent angle from your first house, the place where we kick off important new cycles and express our individuality. But with Saturn hiding in your hush-hush zone, you may want to keep your ideas private for now.

"
9765,13 march 2017,capricorn,"You have one foot on terra firma, the other one in the heavens. Conflicting planetary aspects find you both mentally grounded and sailing away into lands unknown. But this is a good thing, Capricorn–it gives you the chance to think on a grand scale without taking undue risk. Mercury’s entry into your solid fourth house will enable you to challenge the status quo and keep it real.

"
9766,14 march 2017,capricorn,"If you want to achieve anything of value in your life, you’ll have to get out of your current comfort level. A super-charged Moon-Jupiter aspect encourages you to go after some big dreams—but why are you putting up mental resistance? Some tense aspects indicate that you may be holding back. We all have issues that need to be resolved—take care of them and surge forward.

"
9767,15 march 2017,capricorn,"An excellent balance of discipline, creativity, optimism and hard work all combine today to make whatever you’re working on a success. Whether you’re a stay at home mom, a student or a CEO, you have the ability to pull together all of the facets of a project and make them shine.

"
9768,16 march 2017,capricorn,"Your dreams may get a jolt today, Capricorn! I’m not referring to your night time escapades but the ones that occur during the day. Inspirational Neptune is active, stirring up your imagination and creative juices. However, stern Saturn may be throwing a bucket of water on them, saying, “Really?” That’s OK. All dreams should get a reality check before they are acted upon.

"
9769,17 march 2017,capricorn,"With the Sun and Neptune both in your house of thinking, strategizing and communicating, you’re in a darn good spot to express yourself. But should you reveal everything that’s going on in your mind? Probably not! Stern Saturn in your house of secrecy warns to be circumspect about how much you divulge. Whether it’s a business plan, an idea for a screenplay or novel, or a social adventure, keep a lot of the juicy details to yourself.

"
9770,18 march 2017,capricorn,"Your home should be your castle, and if it’s not, this is a good weekend to change that. Perhaps some redecorating is in order. Maybe you need to move—to another place nearby, or another state. If family members are disrupting the harmony at home this is an excellent time to smooth things over. But there’s no need to rush—once the Sun enters Aries on Monday you’ll have a complete month to get things done.

"
9771,19 march 2017,capricorn,"It’s one thing to be involved with other people, be they loved ones or colleagues, and another thing to be controlled by them. If your moods or thoughts are constantly focused on the latest drama created by someone else, or their incessant needs, you need to create some boundaries. Peace of mind is not impossible. It may take some effort, but the planets are urging you to make that your #1 aspiration right now.

"
9772,20 march 2017,capricorn,"Spring officially begins today north of the equator, which means…spring cleaning! Of all the signs you’ll be the most motivated to turn your home into a castle, thanks to the Sun’s entry into Aries. Considering a real estate purchase or a move? This will be on the table over the next four weeks, along with resolving domestic disputes. Just don’t forget to take some down time and relax at home too. You need the break!

"
9773,21 march 2017,capricorn,"Why are you doubting yourself, Capricorn? You may be fearful that things won’t change, or that you don’t have the chops to pull off a major coup. But you do have what it takes. From your chart it appears that you are pushing against previously set boundaries, otherwise known as going out of your comfort zone. Yes, change is uncomfortable—but the results are worth it.

"
9774,22 march 2017,capricorn,"Securing your future is on the planets’ agenda today, especially your financial security. Real estate, retirement accounts, mutual funds or a job that you’re not fearful about losing are all important. With the great transformer, Pluto, in your house of self, your opinion as to what matters may be changing. The next few days could bring confusion, but by Sunday the fog lifts.

"
9775,23 march 2017,capricorn,"You will be in no mood today for dealing with people who slack, make ridiculous demands or become way too emotional. Powerful Pluto in your house of self-esteem is making you rather intolerant these days, so you have to watch the tendency on your  part to become way too emo! This vibe continues into Friday but starts to dissipate over the weekend. Ahh—sweet relief.

"
9776,24 march 2017,capricorn,"Uh, you may  want to control any tendency to boss people around today as a Jupiter-Mercury smackdown indicates that it will backfire. You could be 100% right about something, but that doesn’t mean that others will get that fact. People around you may be so entrenched in doing things their way that they could be bossy too. If you’re at the receiving end of someone in diva mode, just back away and let them rant.

"
9777,25 march 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to start paying attention to some of the sweeter parts of life, such as relaxing and enjoying the company of people you love—which includes you! With a happy meeting of the Sun and Venus this weekend, carve out some quality time for chilling at home with pals, kids, a lover or just yourself. The good news is that this isn’t a “limited time offer” just for the next 48 hours; it’s a trend that will last for the next few months. You’re such a hard worker that you may actually need to book fun time into your schedule. Whatever works!

"
9778,26 march 2017,capricorn,"You are long overdue for some socializing, Capricorn, and the planets want to change that. With energetic Mars in your romance sector, love can heat up quite nicely (and this includes new liaisons). Chatting with neighbors, brunching with friends and inviting people over to your place are all good ways to let your hair down. Yes, you could use some alone time, but not today. Mingle instead.

"
9779,27 march 2017,capricorn,"You’re on a creative roll right now, so let your talents shine. Energetic Mars is ratcheting up your skill level in a big way. And dreamy Neptune, planet of inspiration, is active in the thinking and speaking sector. You can use this positive energy in any way you please–to redecorate your home, hold a meaningful conversation with a child or lover, or impress the boss with a knockout proposal.

"
9780,28 march 2017,capricorn,"Your emotional and physical comfort are in the cosmos’s crosshairs these days, Capricorn, and today’s new moon is designed to help you become more settled. Take an inventory of your life and figure out what needs to be remedied in order to feel more content and at ease: more sleep? a less cluttered home? more time spent in nature? less sugar, caffeine or alcohol? more quality time with family and friends? a daily meditation practice? Then start taking action tomorrow, when a helpful Mercury-Pluto trine will allow you to create better habits—and stick to them.

"
9781,29 march 2017,capricorn,"If you need to close out a part of your emotional life that’s no longer working for you, Capricorn, today’s a good time to start. This isn’t so much about ending relationships as it is about getting rid of toxic thoughts and feelings. Saturn, planet of maturity and stability, has been cruising through the house of the subconscious mind for over two years, performing one heck of a detox. Between now and December you have the opportunity to cleanse your soul and move on.

"
9782,30 march 2017,capricorn,"It may be time for a readjustment when it comes to your career goals, or maybe just your sense of personal power. A Jupiter-Pluto square may find you questioning what’s next in your life. Are you on the right path? Do you need to pull away from certain people who may be trying to hold you back? Once Mercury moves into Taurus tomorrow you’ll want to live a more authentic life.

"
9783,31 march 2017,capricorn,"Of all the signs, you deserve to let your hair down and relax a bit, Capricorn. When the Sun moves into Taurus on April 19th you can really get into a far more chilled out groove, but why not start the party now—even just a little bit? Mercury zips into your fifth house of fun, the place where we stop and smell the roses. And wine, dine, flirt, indulge in hobbies, date, absorb culture, play, and treat ourselves to luxe goodies. The weekend is upon us. Get out there and have some fun!

This vibe will only increase as April continues, so get ready to flirt, turn heads and spend some quality time with a lover.

"
9785,2 april 2017,capricorn,"Tell it like it is! Between now and the 15th it’s crucial to be as direct as possible. That’s because Venus is now retro in your communications sector, which could lead to mixed messages and the confused emotions that follow. Between now and the 15th strive to be clear and concise. The full moon next week on Tuesday will lend you an air of authority that others will notice. use it to your advantage.

"
9786,3 april 2017,capricorn,"People around you may be tugging on your shirt sleeve, demanding attention or favors that you may not want to give. Be polite and listen to what they have to say, but don’t feel as though you are obligated to bend to their wishes. This includes neighbors and friends as well as family members and co-workers. By the way, this vibe continues into next week. At the time of the full moon next Tuesday you may have to put your foot down.

"
9787,4 april 2017,capricorn,"Loved ones may be intent on getting you to do things their way, Capricorn, and it could rile you. You have no problem when it comes to being helpful or a team player, but enough is enough. This vibe isn’t going away any time soon either, so get used to setting boundaries. With next week’s full moon arriving in your house of ambition you can’t slow down your pace in order to rescue people who are capable of helping themselves.

"
9788,5 april 2017,capricorn,"You know what you want, so why aren’t you asking for it? Be more verbal about your plans, demands and ideas. Don’t overshare with people who don’t deserve the full scoop, but you can open up with those people who can open doors for you.

9789,6 april 2017,capricorn,"If there was ever a time in your life to exorcise negative thoughts, emotions and memories, it’s now. Saturn has been traveling through the house of your subconscious mind for over two years, something that it hasn’t done since 1985! The ringed planet goes retrograde today, urging you to do a lot of inner work between now and September. Next year Saturn will be in Capricorn and all eyes will be on you. Make sure that you’re mentally ready for one of the most transformative periods of your existence.

"
9790,7 april 2017,capricorn,"The planets warn against being a Type A workaholic, Capricorn! I know that this is like talking to a wall as your sign is known for its work ethic. But the energy of the Sun collides with Jupiter’s today, creating a situation in which you must  create more balance in your life. Whether you’re single or have a family there needs to be more quality time for the simple pleasures of life.

"
9791,8 april 2017,capricorn,"Good fences make for good neighbors, as the saying goes. And boundaries (real or imagined) are often needed with our family members. Be wary of people close by who are looking for someone to bail them out, or constantly need a shoulder to cry on. Two tough aspects today warn against being too open-hearted. Unfortunately there are those who will take your generosity and use it to their own advantage. Will they be there for you though if you need help?

"
9792,9 april 2017,capricorn,"Now that Mercury is retrograding through your fifth house of romance, you’ll need to keep a cool head about you. Drama, arguments, misunderstandings and the hurt feelings that accompany them could be on the menu from now until the 20th. Oh, and did I mention that exes are known to return during this kind of transit? Egads. If it’s of any comfort to you Tuesday’s full moon is in your house of authority. Wield it.

"
9793,10 april 2017,capricorn,"If you feel that right now is the best time to get moving with a particular decision or plan, then go for it. The full moon tomorrow in your success sector is pushing you to wrap up the past and move on to the next stage of your life. But Pluto in your sign may be holding you back with a lot of “Yes, but”s. If you’re nervous about making changes take baby steps instead of a big leap.

"
9794,11 april 2017,capricorn,"The heavens usher in the annual full moon in the most ambitious part of your chart, a welcome event as it will reward you for months of hard work, not to mention opening up new doors. A radical shift may take place in your career or overall plans for the future. Your intuition is as strong as the logical part of your brains so use both to your advantage. Just beware of pushing yourself too hard–and pushing others over the edge with your ambition!

"
9795,12 april 2017,capricorn,"If you need to make amends with someone today’s a smart time to do so. With charming Neptune in your communication sector you can get your point across with ease.

The Moon in Scorpio will help you not only dream, but to see to it that your ideas are in line with your values. The recent full moon kicks open doors that may have been firmly shut. Start walking through them.

"
9797,14 april 2017,capricorn,"A sudden urge to change a situation that you may have been locked into could arise today, Capricorn! Spontaneous Uranus is acting up in your fourth house, which deals with comfort and security. Busting out of an old groove could become an obsession: moving to another part of the country, for example, or chucking the day job. Perhaps you quickly decide to move in with your boyfriend, or say sayonara to a safe-but-boring lifestyle. Carpe diem.

"
9798,15 april 2017,capricorn,"Lines of communication open and smooth out as magnetic Venus resumes direct motion in your chatty third house. This is especially helpful in matters of the heart.

"
9799,16 april 2017,capricorn,"If someone close offers you advice or throws a piece of information your way, pay attention to what they have to say. You tend to follow your own wisdom most of the time but sometimes it helps to get a second opinion, or to get a different viewpoint. New doors will be opening up for you within the next few weeks, so it’s smart to have your head on straight beforehand.

"
9800,17 april 2017,capricorn,"The say that your body should be treated like a temple, but what about your mind? The planets are encouraging you to indulge in some extreme self care when it comes to your mindset.

"
9801,18 april 2017,capricorn,"A battle is brewing inside your mind, Capricorn, as you grapple with fears, repetitive negative thought patterns and concerns about whether you’re on the right track or not. Powerhouse Pluto is scheduled to retrograde on Thursday in your sign, opening up a five month period of reflection and metamorphosis. You won’t be the same person at the end of September that you are now; you will be far more confident and serene.

"

The Sun has just entered your fifth house of fun, romance and culture, telling you to stop working so damn hard. Not that you’ll pay attention, with aggressive Mars moving into your efficiency sector this Friday. But for heavens’ sakes, would you please pencil in some down time once a week?

"
9803,20 april 2017,capricorn,"You need a break, Capricorn, and the cosmos is officially putting you on “bed rest”. Sort of. With Pluto retrograding today in your sign, and Mercury doing the same in your house of self-nurturing, it’s time to slow down and lighten up your schedule. While you won’t be spending days in bed you should  be looking for ways to make your life less stressed. And if that means pulling away from people who bring too much drama and discomfort into your life so be it. You need to recharge your batteries.

"
9804,21 april 2017,capricorn,"Work that body! Energetic Mars enters your health and fitness sector for the first time in two years, lighting a fire under you to live a cleaner and more vibrant lifestyle. It doesn’t hurt that Pluto went retrograde yesterday in your sign. Pluto is the planet that will pinpoint weaknesses in our habits and lives so that we can fix them, and it often requires a complete overhaul. But like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, you can morph into a fitter, happier version of yourself. Now drop to the floor and give me 20 pushups.

"
9805,22 april 2017,capricorn,"This is not a good day to wear your heart on your sleeve, nor is it wise to reveal too much information of any kind! A difficult Venus-Saturn square recommends that you keep your cards close to your vest. Knowledge is power, and the more information you keep hidden the better off you’ll be.

"
9806,23 april 2017,capricorn,"You can sell ice cream to Eskimos today as gentle Venus puts the right words in your mouth, Capricorn. If you need to persuade anyone to come around to your viewpoint this is the time to go for it. Self promotion and social media campaigns are also favored, as are expressing yourself beautifully in writing (think manuscript or screenplay) and artistically.

"
9807,24 april 2017,capricorn,"Decluttering your home always is helpful in feeling less stressed, but sometimes you just have to declutter your mind. If it’s too full of random thoughts, things that you’re annoyed about, and the demands that other people are placing on you, it’s time to relieve the burden. (And I’m not talking about doing so with vodka or sedatives.) Start this process now, my friend. The new moon on Wednesday falls in the most life-affirming, fun parts of your chart. You need to unwind first.

"
9808,25 april 2017,capricorn,"Seems like it’s time for some mental feng shui, Capricorn. Your emotional state is the cosmos’s focus as planets are lining up in one of the most comfort-driven parts of your chart. Sober Saturn has been in the house of your subconscious mind for over two years now, helping you heal. But today you can take a quantum leap forward as Uranus encourages you to try new modalities. If previous methods for mental healing haven’t worked, seek out new ones that will.

9809,26 april 2017,capricorn,"Feeling romantic? You should be with a new moon occurring in the most amorous part of your chart. But there’s a strong nesting vibe here, suggesting that you won’t be looking for dubious flings or partners who can’t go the distance—as in, all the way to the altar. Already committed goats are recommended to start spending more time at home alone with your lover and family. This lunation will spark your creative side as well, so get ready to dazzle at the workplace.

"
9810,27 april 2017,capricorn,"Current planetary activity is encouraging you to live a more authentic life, which means getting off the career treadmill, if just for a few hours a week! You may just feel like collapsing on the couch and binge watching Netflix, but that’s not what the cosmos has in mind. Take a day off and go window shopping, visit a museum and enjoy a leisurely lunch at a cafe. Sign up for watercolor classes. Curl up with a good book and a cup of tea. Be good to yourself, and open your mind to the culture that’s all around you.

"
9811,28 april 2017,capricorn,"The cosmos dishes up some interesting aspects your way, Capricorn. The recent new moon fell in your house of enjoying life and getting out more. Yet today Venus glides into your domestic sector, suggesting that you spend more time at home relaxing. Strike a balance between the two. Either way, you’ll be far more relaxed and at ease than you have been in recent months.

"
9812,29 april 2017,capricorn,"“Mind like water” is an Eastern philosophy, one that many of us would like to achieve: serenity and contentment in the midst of the usual daily chaos. Saturn has been in the house of your subconscious mind for two years now, trying to bring you greater peace. But it won’t happen unless you start letting some of your work stress go first. You have to start somewhere.

"
9813,30 april 2017,capricorn,"Connecting with others become easier with a happy Sun-Moon aspect. El Sol is currently in your house of creativity, so think about new and more constructive ways of communicating with others. This can be verbally, of course, but also consider your writing skills and any artistic skills that might be getting a little rusty.

"
9814,1 may 2017,capricorn,"Despite your best intentions to be a team player others may be unpredictable today, ranging from outright cranky to sullen and passive aggressive. Who cares? With so much planetary energy building up your self esteem and feelings of contentment, you might let their negativity roll off of you like water down a duck’s back. And that’s  progress!

"
9815,2 may 2017,capricorn,"The planets are in a practical mood and you’re a practical soul, so the energy on offer this week is perfect for you. Today it’s advised that you take a good long look at your finances and get them in order. Know how much debt you have and how you plan to pay it down. Consider what steps you can take to increase your net worth. When Mercury goes direct tomorrow, saving for a home or home and family-related expenses will be front and center.

"
9816,3 may 2017,capricorn,"Thank your lucky stars, Mercury goes direct in your family zone. If siblings, kids, parents, roommates or a spouse have been a pain in the tush, things should start to ease up. A sparkling Sun-Neptune aspect today bodes well for improving relationships with kids and siblings especially. The next few weeks are also terrific for decorating as your creativity soars, thanks to the Sun in your artistic zone.

"
9817,4 may 2017,capricorn,"Don’t rest on your laurels, Capricorn. You may feel like slacking off a little bit and heavens knows you would deserve to do so. But you have momentum going in certain parts of your life that you would be wise to maintain, if not increase. The passionate Moon is encouraging you to take a few intelligent risks and get out of your comfort zone. With the Sun blazing  a path through the most creative part of your chart it would be foolish to not it everything that you’ve got.

"
9818,5 may 2017,capricorn,"Regardless as to what you do for a living, you should be injecting more passion and flair into your daily efforts. The mighty Sun is in your sector of artistry, telling you to approach all areas of your life with more zest. “But I’ve got a soul-sucking job that I can’t stand”, you might say. Oh really? Then now is the perfect time to research your options. Even if you can’t afford to quit the day job you can start something worthwhile on the side. What are you waiting for?

"
9819,6 may 2017,capricorn,"Pushing past your current comfort zone is what it’s all about over the next week, but this can create feelings of discomfort. Stern Saturn may be stirring up fears and concerns, and you could end up today thinking that you’re better off staying just where you are. But that all changes tomorrow as the Moon meets up with abundant Jupiter, sparking more optimism.

"
9820,7 may 2017,capricorn,"It’s the weekend but your mind is on success as the passionate Moon meets up with abundant Jupiter in the most ambitious part of your chart. Better yet is that inspirational Neptune is in fine form too, so carve out an hour to do some strategizing. Consider how partnering with others might advance your plans, as Wednesday’s full moon falls in your collaboration sector. A coach or a mentor is a smart option to pursue.

"
9821,8 may 2017,capricorn,"Family members and loved ones might be pushing your buttons, Capricorn, and emotions may get heated. You’re willing to work with people but not be run over by them, so if anyone needs to be put in their place you could do so between now and Wednesday. Tomorrow is the best day to talk things over with kids or a lover, so wait until then before you cut loose.

"
9822,9 may 2017,capricorn,"Today is a winner on a number of different levels, Capricorn! Pluto is telling you to own your personal power, not to be afraid to show the world who you are and what you think. And the Sun is in a fabulous spot from your creativity sector, which is like pouring gasoline on a fire. It’s time to take a more creative approach to life, expressing your individuality through everything you do—the way you dress, talk, and decorate your home; the dishes you prepare; the vacations you take; and your choice of occupation. Approach your life as an artist would.

"
9823,10 may 2017,capricorn,"If you’ve been working hard on a group effort or online project, the long hours and toil may finally start to pay off, Capricorn. The full moon tonight in Scorpio falls in the tech and teamwork part of your chart. This may only be a resting place, a time to congratulate yourself for a job well done before moving on to the next level, but momentum is building. This is also a super time to launch a venture, whether you’re planning a family reunion or an online shop. Your creative juices are running high thanks to the Sun in the most artistic part of your chart, and with powerful Pluto in a good angle you are definitely stepping into a more influential role.

"
9824,11 may 2017,capricorn,"Looking for love? Want to inject more passion and excitement into an existing union? Then today’s happy Sun-Pluto aspect will help you get your groove back. From your chart it appears that you are going to be the one who makes this happen, so don’t sit around and wait for your partner to plan that three-day getaway to the romantic B&B in the countryside. Singles, you’re in a superb spot to meet a long time love, someone with depth. But all goats should be looking of more ways to inject some fun into their lives, not just romance. You desperately need some down time.

"
9825,12 may 2017,capricorn,"Got goals? Then you’ll be happier than a pig in mud today as the most motivated planet in the solar system, Mars, reaches out to abundant Jupiter. You can’t go wrong with this pairing, no sirree. It’s an excellent time to launch new initiatives, make progress with existing ones, and to impress muckety-mucks with your perseverance and brilliance. It’s a great time to try a new technique, hack, routine or to look at something from a fresh perspective

"
9826,13 may 2017,capricorn,"The planets are in a mood to help you manifest what’s important to you, and today their lesson is all about mental clarity. A meeting of the Moon and Saturn will help you get rid of worries, fears and other obstacles that may be in your way, which may include toxic people. It’s imperative to get the “junk out of the trunk”, so to speak, because the Sun is driving up your creativity. In order to let your brilliance shine forth you have to clean out the dark, dusty cobwebs in your mind.

"
9827,14 may 2017,capricorn,"You’ve got the chops to get things done, a realization that’s finally starting to hit you. The question is: do you need to rub other people’s noses in that fact? Sometimes the best way to wield strength or to make progress with a plan is to say as little as possible. What people don’t know will work in your favor.

"
9828,15 may 2017,capricorn,"The term “power trip” usually brings up negative connotations of people with big egos trying to show off and push others around. But you’re on a different kind of power trip, thanks to Pluto’s potent activity in your sign. This is about quietly assuming an inner strength that is unshakeable, regardless as to what’s going on around you. And it comes from learning to love yourself, just as much as you would love another.

"
9829,16 may 2017,capricorn,"The cosmos is dishing up a few contradictory aspects for you this week, Capricorn. Today Mercury enters your fifth house of having more fun, enjoying romance, spending quality time with your kids and really digging into hobbies or art. No problem there, right? But on Saturday the Sun pops into your ultra-efficient sixth house, which means: balancing checkbooks, cleaning out junk drawers and closets and catching up on your to-do list both at home and at work. It’s definitely a glam versus utilitarian battle here. My advice: don’t let the to-do list win. Find a way to balance both.

"
9830,17 may 2017,capricorn,"Your brain may be crackling with some pretty interesting ideas, and once the Sun moves into Gemini this weekend you’ll have the chance to act on them. For today, though, consider the kinds of habits and systems you’d need to have in place in order for them to succeed. Furthermore, who do you need on your team? To mentor you? In business, who is your ideal customer or client? Lay the groundwork now.

"
9831,18 may 2017,capricorn,"Sometimes you need to take a few steps back before you can move forward, and that’s what the cosmos suggests for you today. With abundant Jupiter in your house of ambition and success for the first time in over a decade, you are no doubt highly motivated to make big changes. The problem is that you may have too many good ideas, or you’re working so diligently that you’re failing to see the overall picture. Slow down, think about where you’re heading and the most efficient way to get there. Once the Sun rolls into Gemini on Saturday you’ll be unstoppable.

"
9832,19 may 2017,capricorn,"Serious Saturn has been cruising through the house of your subconscious mind for two years now, trying to help you release negative patterns and people. But that kind of change usually isn’t easy, nor is it fast. Well say “hallelujah”, because today Saturn forms a rare aspect with spontaneous Uranus in which closure and healing can take place quickly. These two orbs will be traveling in an excellent, tight angle over the next six months, so get out of any pity parties and move on. You’ll be glad that you did.

"
9833,20 may 2017,capricorn,"First the good news: the Sun has just entered the most efficient, organized part of your chart. Over the next four weeks you can blast through chores and to-do lists like a champ. Now for the funky stuff: there could be some hidden resistance to your efforts. It could come in the form of a malcontent at the office, a family member who’s determined to be difficult or a frenemy. But it could also be the little demons in your own mind that hold you up. You know: procrastination, fear of success, bad habits or systems, negative thought loops that keep spinning around and so on. Figure out where the problem lies and take care of it, stat. Red hot Mars is also in this part of the sky, so you should be unstoppable.

"
9834,21 may 2017,capricorn,"Now that the Sun is in the most efficient part of your chart you should be feeling more motivated to get all of the parts of your life together, from your diet to balancing checkbooks to being caught up with work at the office. Today the Moon is in your domestic sector, so this is the perfect time to get organized at home. You probably won’t be able to accomplish everything in one day, but hey, you gotta start somewhere.

"
9835,22 may 2017,capricorn,"Need some personal space? With Venus in the most warm, fuzzy and security conscious parts of your chart, clinginess could become an issue this week: either you’re latching on to someone or they’re so far up your tuckus that you can’t sit down. This could reach critical mass by Thursday, so my advice is to try to work things out today. Venus is in a conciliatory mood, so talks should go well.

"
9836,23 may 2017,capricorn,"Boundaries. We often need to set them with other people, but sometimes we need to set them with ourselves. What are you willing to tolerate in your life, and what is simply not acceptable to you? Some people call them rules, others call them standards. Either way you’re going to have to make some big decisions over the next week as to what your limits are.

"
9837,24 may 2017,capricorn,"With tomorrow’s new moon occurring in your house of getting things done, you won’t be in the mood for anyone or anything that might slow you down over the next few months. So take a little time today to chill out, whether it’s with a lover, pals or by yourself. The people closest to you may not see you as much as they’d like in the near future; make them happy now!

"
9838,25 may 2017,capricorn,"Get with the program. It’s time to cut out people, situations or systems that aren’t productive. This isn’t heartless: it’s necessary. Today’s new moon in the most efficient part of your chart demands that you streamline in order to live a happier, more stress free life. People may cling and claw, not wanting to be cut out from your existence. Or, they want to keep their head trips and dramas going. Unfortunately for them, you’re in no mood to deal with it. Keep moving forward.

"
9839,26 may 2017,capricorn,"Calling all shamans! The cosmos has quite the spiritual vibe for you today, so get in touch with your inner self. Reiki, meditation, prayer, walks in nature—all of these can help you make that all-important connection. Don’t be surprised if you experience an “aha!” moment as spontaneous Uranus is in a helpful spot.

"
9840,27 may 2017,capricorn,"Here’s the good news: with aggressive Mars in your house of wellness you could become incredibly motivated to get fit and rid yourself of aches and pains. Now for the downside: in your impatience you might overdo it, get impatient with yourself and your results, and possibly injure yourself. Slow down the pace a little and give your body time to catch up and heal.

"
9841,28 may 2017,capricorn,"Getting your message out to the world becomes a heck of a lot easier these days as inspirational Neptune is placing the right words in your mouth—or your pen-or your keyboard! It’s a stellar time to develop your brand, complete a thesis or put the finishing flourishes on a creative project.

"
9842,29 may 2017,capricorn,"Sometimes we can be our own worst enemy when it comes to making progress in our lives. We go on diets and then fall off the wagon; we ruminate over things that might happen in the future but in reality, rarely do; habits are hard to break ; and we allow too much drama into our lives, whether we create it or others do it for us. Well, mature Saturn has had enough of this, thank you very much, and says that it’s time to snap out of it. Quit blaming others and take a look at yourself.

"
9843,30 may 2017,capricorn,"Taking better care of yourself becomes a priority today with a happy and productive Mars-Uranus meet up. With Mars in your house of fitness and vitality for the first time in two years, you should be highly motivated to make smart changes. But Uranus wants you to also nurture your psyche, so remove yourself from draining situations and people.

"
9844,31 may 2017,capricorn,"You know what you want, but how do you go about getting it? Fortunately for you smart little Mercury is in the most innovative part of your chart, stirring up your creative juices. Consider new avenues and techniques, then get ready to make things happen.

"
9845,1 june 2017,capricorn,"You’ll need to balance your needs against those of others as it appears that people around you may be making demands on your time–and your patience. Gently let them know that although you’re there to help, that you can only do so much. The reality is that they need to take ownership of their own problems, and setting some boundaries on your part may actually help them realize that.

"
9846,1 june 2016,capricorn,"Take a deep breath and count to ten. The Sun in your house of productivity just wants you to get your job done, whether it’s the food shopping or returning e-mails at work. But Neptune is throwing up resistance. The key to finessing this energy is to keep your mouth shut! You run the risk of saying something you shouldn’t. Be very careful what you put in writing as well. Neptune is known for creating confusion, and the next few days are going to test your patience.

"
9847,2 june 2017,capricorn,"Your confidence gets a big boost as optimistic Jupiter is happily situated in your ambition and success sector. You’re on the verge of stepping into a more self-assured place, and a lot of this simply comes down to the nitty gritty. Gaining control over your schedule and your habits will help you take your ideas and make them real. Think about what you can achieve in the next 90 days–then go for it!

"
9848,2 june 2016,capricorn,"Seems like the little goat has been playing it too conservatively for the cosmos’ taste. Honey, it’s time to bust out of an old self-image and lifestyle and enjoy a more creative existence! So book an appointment at the hair salon for a new do, plan a trip to some crazy far-off location that no one would ever picture you visiting, and dig those watercolor and oil paints out of the closet. We’re the only species on the planet that can create works of art. We also can choose to live inside the box…or on the fringe! Push those boundaries.

"
9849,3 june 2017,capricorn,"A sudden desire to revamp your home life, romance, career and  your figure may seem to come out of nowhere, but it’s the cosmos at work. Luxe Venus, planet of beauty (and big bucks too I might add) is winking at let’s-just-do-this-already Uranus. So if your motivation level skyrockets over the next few days, you’ll know why. With the approaching full moon in your house of closure, you should be more than ready to move on to a much higher level of living. Bon voyage!

"
9850,4 june 2017,capricorn,"Teaming up with others is the way to go now that Mars has entered your partnering sector for the first time since 2015. On the romance front, Venus is just about to enter your house of flirting and fun, which bodes well for singles as well as couples. And your career can get a big boost by collaborating with others, whether it’s a standard business partner or an expert whom you retain to push your interests forward. Consider an accountability partner too if you’re starting a new workout regimen or trying to break a habit.

"
9851,5 june 2017,capricorn,"Drowning in paperwork? Overwhelmed by all of the items on your to-do list? Feel like a hamster on a wheel, never able to get to the things that really excite you? We all go through it, Capricorn, but your sign is feeling it the most right now. That’s because the Sun is squaring confusing Neptune, which may find you at a loss as to which task you should start next. The good news is that clarity starts to seep in as of tomorrow when practical Mercury enters your house of efficiency. Until then, just do the best you can.

"
9852,6 june 2017,capricorn,"A flirty, more festive time has arrived thanks to luxe Venus shimmying into your fifth house of fun, romance and creativity! Not only can you find a new lover or spend more quality time with your amour, you can simply slow down a bit and smell the roses. And the Pinot Grigio…and the latte…and the Chanel #5. It’s time for a bit of pampering as you freshen up your look. Some new designer clothes, perhaps? Think Cinderella, fairy godmothers and balls at the palace to get you in the right mindset.

"
9853,7 june 2017,capricorn,"You’re in a bit of an odd spot, Capricorn. The Sun has been in your go-go-go sector of efficiency, and Mercury heads there today too. But other planets warn that you need to slow your roll a bit. After all, what’s the point in tearing through tasks if you’re not really focused on them? Mistakes will be made, and they usually cost time and money. Revise your methods. Being constantly busy doesn’t mean that you’re actually getting somewhere.

"
9854,8 june 2017,capricorn,"The manner in which you communicate with others in the workplace could use an update, Capricorn. This isn’t so much about day-to-day chitchat but the way you present your ideas to bosses, clients and colleagues. Contracts, brochures, your website, brand, Powerpoint presentations, sales and marketing methods: all of these need to be tweaked. Considering that Jupiter is just about to go direct in your ambition sector, it’s time to rethink the overall image you present to the world.

"
9855,9 june 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to put an end to situations that are way  past their sell-by date, Capricorn! Tonight’s full moon falls in the house of closure, so out with the old and in with the new. If you want to view this as your own personal New Year’s Eve in June, so be it. Toss out bad habits, old ways of doing business, holding a torch for an ex (why? why?), frenemies, a crummy diet, and anything else that you recognize as dead weight. Then start searching for more powerful and constructive ways of getting things done.

"
9856,10 june 2017,capricorn,"Woo-hoo! Generous Jupiter has resumed direct motion in your house of ambition and success after a four-month nap. If progress with any of your major goals was slow (even nonexistent), that’s about to change. Naturally things won’t happen unless you get involved, but with disciplined Saturn in a good angle you should be off and running. Intelligent, strategic Mercury is in your house of efficiency, so all of the stars are lining up to help you effect change.

"
9857,11 june 2017,capricorn,"You’re seeking stability in all areas of your life, and now is the time to quietly figure out how to obtain it. Fortunately a number of planets are in your logical, left brain type houses, which is super for clarity. Ruminate today and start taking action on Tuesday.

"
9858,12 june 2017,capricorn,"Big plans and goals get a boost as the most abundant and optimistic planet in the solar system, Jupiter, is in fine form. It’s not only a good time to make an impression on decision makers, you can also step into your own personal power. Over the next few months people will be viewing you as more of an authority, so get ready for your close up.

"
9859,13 june 2017,capricorn,"Feel like you’re getting the runaround? This is most likely today from co-workers or customer service people. You also need to check out the fine print on contracts for any “weasel words”, statements that are too vague or enable someone to slither away from a commitment. Due diligence, baby. It may be a hassle but you’ll be happy that you did it.

"
9860,14 june 2017,capricorn,"Need to develop better habits and routines? Now’s a good time to start with the motivating Moon in your house of stability and rituals. Accountability starts with you, so get your act together before you expect others to do so. You will  be delegating tasks to others in the weeks ahead, but right now it’s all about your own level of efficiency.

"
9861,15 june 2017,capricorn,"If you feel as though you’re pulling away from other people, don’t be surprised. Mature Saturn is active in your house of seclusion and introspection, and today the ringed planet is determined to shut out noise from the outside world. Pay attention to your own inner wisdom than the opinions of others. This will be especially true over the next five months when Neptune begins to retrograde tomorrow.

"
9862,16 june 2017,capricorn,"Dust off the handy BS meter: you’re going to need it. Murky Neptune retrogrades in your communication sector, indicating that people in your world could be handing you a truckload of manure. Over the next five months you’ll need to second guess what people are saying and thinking. And make sure that you’re as crystal clear as can be, because this murkiness can cloak you in a fog of mixed signals. You may feel indecisive, but don’t let that translate into wishy-washy behavior on your part.

"
9863,17 june 2017,capricorn,"With the mighty Sun and shrewd Mercury in your house of efficiency, you’re definitely in a place of wanting to get things done. Problem is, your brain seems to be the consistency of scrambled eggs these days. It could be burnout, it could be stress, or maybe you’ve taken on too may responsibilities. You need to quiet your mind before you tackle anything new.

"
9864,18 june 2017,capricorn,"A sudden urge to get the loose ends of your daily grind pulled together may hit you today Capricorn, and to quote Martha Stewart, “it’s a good thing.” Unfinished tasks and sloppy systems can create more stress than you realize, so now’s the time to make some changes.

"
9865,19 june 2017,capricorn,"Turn up your radar, Capricorn. Someone in your circle, most likely at the office, doesn’t have your back and may be working at cross purposes to you. Listen, you may already know who this is and chances are this won’t faze you too much. But say as little as possible–and observe a lot.

"
9866,20 june 2017,capricorn,"A positive solution to a problem could come today out of the blue, and it will bring a sigh of relief. This has more to do with your mindset and sense of internal peace than anything else. So even if people around you are acting up or circumstances are crazy, you should enter the eye of the hurricane—and stay there.

"
9867,21 june 2017,capricorn,"The independent goat may start to consider bonding with others in the weeks ahead. That’s because strategic Mercury has entered your partnership zone along with his buddy the Sun. Oh, and don’t be surprised if you become more interested too in developing a stronger romantic relationship! That’s in the stars as well, and that includes you singles.

"
9868,22 june 2017,capricorn,"Having someone in your corner to run ideas past is advised, now that the partnership zone of your chart is lit up. At the end of 2017 you will be entering one of the most amazing periods of your life, an event that hasn’t happened in 30 years: Saturn enters Capricorn. Spend the next six months getting ready.

"
9869,23 june 2017,capricorn,"From your chart it appears that you need to get real about your closest relationships. It’s time to protect your own interests, which may sound selfish but it’s absolutely necessary. Pay attention to your gut–it won’t steer you in the wrong direction. Assess who’s on your side and who’s not.

"
9870,24 june 2017,capricorn,"A passionate period begins, one that just doesn’t include romance. The new moon in Cancer kicks off a six-month chapter in which you can make progress in love: finding someone new, getting engaged or taking an existing relationship to a deeper level. But it’s also a terrific time to pour your passion into hobbies and creative pursuits that put a smile on your face. Passion isn’t just about love: it can be a way of approaching life.

"
9871,25 june 2017,capricorn,"Your desire to be a good little Capricorn and be charming and diplomatic with everyone is wearing thin today, and you will continue to feel like this on and off over the next week. With inspirational Neptune in a good spot from your communication sector, you can easily speak your mind–but why bother if others are going to be difficult? Choose your battles–or the people you connect with–wisely.

"
9872,26 june 2017,capricorn,"Inspiration may strike when you least expect it, and this week could be full of inspirational moments. That’s because mind-broadening Neptune is in your mental third house, stirring up thoughts that you can take and run with. But your best bet is to collaborate with others, so don’t play lone wolf–and least not for the next three to four weeks.

"
9873,26 june 2016,capricorn,"Don’t hide your light under a bushel! A rare trine between Pluto and Jupiter could put you in the spotlight in a big way. Jupiter is in the part of the sky that deals with the news media, publishing, and gaining recognition. If you have been confused about the path ahead, today’s trine could point you in the right direction. No matter what, you won’t be thinking small. This aspect won’t happen again until 2024, so make the most of it.

"
9874,27 june 2017,capricorn,"If you need to persuade people around you to work together more closely, today’s planetary aspects have your back. This has been–and will continue to be–a bumpy week when it comes to gaining cooperation from others. Push for teamwork over the next 48 hours, because by Friday people will be in a funk again!

"
9875,27 june 2016,capricorn,"Sweet love! The two planets of amour, Neptune and Venus, form the best possible angle possible—a trine. Neptune is in your house of discussions, telling you to speak your mind with your amour. It’s an excellent time to clear the air so that the two of you can move on. Single and looking? The cosmos has your back. Your best chance for finding new love is via a friend, considering that Mars is active today in your house of acquaintances. Or is that platonic friend of yours looking hot all of a sudden?

"
9876,28 june 2017,capricorn,"Strong-as-an-ox Pluto has been really pushing you lately to take charge of your life, and you may be feeling like a lone renegade as a result. But a Mars-Mercury aspect suggests that two heads are better than one, and that you can travel down your path more quickly if you have company. Don’t view people as extra baggage—they can actually help you along the way.

"
9877,28 june 2016,capricorn,"Stay where you are, or move on? Planetary aspects indicate that you may be facing a quandary as to which path to take. Whether it’s a family matter, business opportunity or romance, you seem to be resisting some form of change. Your sense of security is at stake here, but lucky Jupiter encourages you to take a risk.

"
9878,29 june 2017,capricorn,"A strong independent streak may be building inside of you; the desire to go it alone. This doesn’t mean that you’re going to break off relationships with others but you will  be more determined than usual to follow your own agenda. Just don’t ram it down someone else’s throat. This is one instance in which discretion is the best strategy.

"
9879,29 june 2016,capricorn,"Pluto is back stroking through your first house of self, asking you to analyze the various parts of your life that you think need to be changed. For some goats, a little tweak may be needed here and there; others may be considering a total overhaul! Whatever it is that needs to be changed, the recent full moon has made it clear that some “house cleaning” needs to be done, metaphorically speaking. Today you may get hit with a sudden dose of inspiration. Work with it; honor it.

"
9880,30 june 2017,capricorn,"To thine own self be true? A planetary battle is brewing as Mars an Pluto are inching closer to a face off in the heavens. In your case, Capricorn, the issue will be your needs and goals versus those of others. Fortunately the Moon will help you take care of both in a diplomatic and generous manner.

"
9881,30 june 2016,capricorn,"With two full moons in a row in the most sensitive part of your chart, you’ve been releasing people, situations, habits and thought patterns that aren’t working for you anymore. In addition, powerhouse Pluto in your house of self is determined to dismantle weakness in the foundation of your life, even if that means using a wrecking ball. While you  may be feeling more upbeat as these changes take place, not everyone around you is. Today’s Pluto-Venus opposition will make that apparent. Roll with it.

"
9882,1 july 2017,capricorn,"It may be the start of a holiday weekend in the US but your mind will still be on your biggest aspirations. And this is a good thing, as inspirational Neptune is helping you to consider new ways of going about them. Once Venus changes signs on the 4th practicality will be the name of the game, so get ready to select the very best projects to go after.

"
9883,2 july 2017,capricorn,"How much you want to share with others, and just how much you want them to know about your life is going to be recurring theme this week. A powerful struggle today between Mars and Pluto could encourage you to go off the grid, so to speak. Face it, not everyone is entitled to the juicy details of your life and the plans you’re making. Be discrete.

"
9884,2 july 2016,capricorn,"Hmmm….got a secret agenda? There’s quite a hush-hush vibe at play in your romance sector, as the Sun forms an interesting angle with Saturn in your house of confidentiality. Perhaps you’re keeping your thoughts to yourself, or you’re not quite ready to move on to the next step with your amour. That’s OK. Monday’s new moon in this part of your chart opens up a six month period in which you can make some big decisions.

"
9885,3 july 2017,capricorn,"You’ve been on somewhat of an independent streak lately, but today’s happy lunar activity suggests that you reach out to friends and loved ones. This isn’t just for socializing, by the way. Someone in your circle may mention something that inspires you or makes you feel more grounded.

"
9886,3 july 2016,capricorn,"Energy is building in your romantic sector, as tomorrow’s new moon falls in this part of the sky. Today the Sun embraces amorous Neptune in your communication sector, telling you that it’s time to have a serious talk with your beloved about where your relationship is going. They form a trine, the most glorious angle possible. Singles, this is a superb time to meet someone new! And all Capricorns may discover that someone may want to form a business alliance with them in the months to come.

"
9887,4 july 2017,capricorn,"Some major shifts are about to happen as the upcoming full moon on Saturday helps you get crystal clear about what you want to do next in your life. This lunation occurs in Capricorn, so it will be all about establishing new cycles. Fortunately Venus enters your ultra-efficient sixth house today, making it easy to find the right hacks and habits to make things happen.

"
9888,4 july 2016,capricorn,"Got the urge to merge? The new moon in the partnership part of your chart opens up the possibility for you to join forces with someone new, either romantically or in business. Serious Saturn is in a strong position, promising longevity for the union. But you may need to keep your relationship or plans quiet for a while. Neptune in your communication sector will enable you to hold productive discussions!

"
9889,5 july 2017,capricorn,"A match made in the heavens: intelligent Mercury has just entered your fact-finding, laser-focused eighth house. Whether you want to figure out how to boost your company’s profits or figure out what’s going on in your lover’s head, you are now in super sleuth mode. No need to steal their phone and snoop their texts. Intuition and an analytical mind are all you need.

"
9890,5 july 2016,capricorn,"If things have been confusing—or even questionable—in a romantic relationship, today is perfect for getting to the bottom of the matter. Foggy Neptune has been retrograde in your communication sector, but planetary aspects today help clear some of the mist away.

"
9891,6 july 2017,capricorn,"“If you want things done the right way, you just have to do them yourself.” That may be your mindset these days as lovers and colleagues seem to either slack or be somehow unwilling to do their share. But this won’t deter you. With Saturday’s full moon occurring in your sign, you may actually be better off doing things your way!

"
9892,6 july 2016,capricorn,"Feel like getting hitched? You could be thinking about that today, as the cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, embrace in the heavens. It’s all about serious commitment, so singles, be out there looking! The action is taking place in your house of partnerships, so it’s possible too that someone may be interested in working with you over the next six months in some kind of business venture.

"
9893,7 july 2017,capricorn,"Talking things over is far better than letting them fester inside of you. True, tomorrow’s full moon is in Capricorn, so you may be quite focused on yourself these days. And true, you may not really be depending on others all that much lately to get things done. But holding in resentment or annoyance will slow you down….and who needs that?

"
9894,7 july 2016,capricorn,"Pluto is in your house of self, challenging you to grow and stretch past your boundaries. Today this little powerhouse opposes planets in your partnership sector, creating potential friction between you and a romantic or business alliance. There could also be flak coming from parents or a family member, so you’ll need to really think about your needs versus those of the people around you.

"
9895,8 july 2017,capricorn,"It’s all about you, Capricorn! Tonight’s full moon occurs in your sign, and it could represent a turning point. Some major projects that you may have started around the time of your birthday could come to pass, a source of great satisfaction. And as one chapter wraps up another one begins. Don’t be surprised if you suddenly change direction: maverick Uranus is acting up, pointing out new possibilities to you.

"
9896,8 july 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes it’s wise to go it alone in life, and other times it’s better to team up with others who share your world view. Today is when the latter applies. If someone shows interest in working with you (or romancing you!), consider what they have to say and what they have to offer. You may find that you end up traveling down a path that you had never considered, but with lucky Jupiter involved, you can’t go wrong.

"
9897,9 july 2017,capricorn,"There’s no point in arguing with people who don’t see things your way. You know the old saying: you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink. Yesterday’s full moon was in your sign; push forward with your agenda and make things happen. It could take a lot of time before they come around, so don’t wait.

"
9898,9 july 2016,capricorn,"Keeping an open mind should be easier with today’s Moon-Jupiter meet up in the most optimistic part of your chart. You’ll be ready to tell it like it is and to listen to someone else’s point of view. With logical Saturn in your house of intuition, your gut will also help you figure out what’s going on in someone else’s head.

"
9899,10 july 2017,capricorn,"There is no “I” in the word “team”….which is perfectly fine with you! A Sun-Pluto opposition today will make you determined to follow your own path and play by your rules. This energy will continue over the next two weeks, so don’t be surprised if you pull away from the madding crowd and work quietly on your own activities.

"
9900,10 july 2016,capricorn,"Collaborative efforts are strongly favored by the cosmos, as the Sun and Mercury in your partnership area form magnificent angles with Mars and Jupiter. You may view yourself as the Lone Ranger in love or business, but the planets have other plans for you. In their wisdom they know that our lives are made far richer by associating with others who our soulmates, friends and colleagues. Reach out to like-minded people, as they are your ticket to a bigger future.

"
9901,11 july 2017,capricorn,"Sometimes it pays to break the rules or shake things up in order to get ahead, but today is not one of those times. The traditional, tried-and-true methods will work the best. Remember this if you’re trying to impress a decision maker.

"
9902,11 july 2016,capricorn,"Someone close could go into full diva mode and it may take you by surprise. With Mercury in your conciliatory partnership zone, you will no doubt be the one taking the high road in this situation. But will the other party? You can only do so much. If someone wants to play the role of martyr there’s not much you can do.

"
9903,12 july 2017,capricorn,"The recent full moon in your sign has no doubt inspired you to look after your own best interests, and bravo if you are! There’s no point in hiding your opinions either, and with the Moon now in the most expressive part of your chart you should speak up. This includes blogging, teaching, writing and social media. You never know whose attention you might catch.

"
9904,12 july 2016,capricorn,"The ancients placed sex and money in the same house, the eighth. They also considered Venus to be the planet of love and profits. Guess what, Capricorn? Lucky Venus enters your eighth house today, taking the term “getting lucky” to a much higher level! While things could become quite steamy in the boudoir, you could also score some wins when it comes to your financial strategy. The eighth house deals with passive income rather than salary, so spend the next few weeks brainstorming ways to make money on the side. When you’re taking a breather from intimacy, that is!

"
9905,13 july 2017,capricorn,"You’re in a good spot, Capricorn. The recent full moon was in your sign, highlighting your ideas, dreams and kicking off brand new cycles. Today watery Neptune douses you with inspiration, so get ready for some intriguing ideas to flow into your mind.

"
9906,13 july 2016,capricorn,"As the full moon in Capricorn on the 19th draws near, you should be getting ready to kick off a brand new cycle in your life. And with Mercury’s entry into your fiscal eighth house today, it’s prime time for considering wealth. The eighth house is big bucks, my friend, not small change. Mercury is the planet of buying, selling, negotiating and closing deals. Use its clever energy to add more cash to your bottom line.

"
9907,14 july 2017,capricorn,"Here’s the good news: abundant Jupiter is super active today in your ambition sector. But the flip side of this is that you may be going in too many directions, attracted to “shiny things” here and there. Fortunately logical, strategic Mercury is in your house of laser-like focus. Use it to narrow down your options.

"
9908,14 july 2016,capricorn,"Balancing act. That’s what is necessary as the demands of the outside world seem to be infringing on your personal needs. You need time for your family, loved ones and yes, yourself. This may hit you like a bolt of lightning under today’s planetary influences, so consider how you can create more quality time while still maintaining your other responsibilities.

"
9909,15 july 2017,capricorn,"It’s crucial to communicate with others–and to be diplomatic about it too! You may be so hell bent on pursuing your own agenda that you forget that you’ll need the help of others along the way. They’re not mind readers, so let them know what you’re thinking and planning.

"
9910,15 july 2016,capricorn,"Discipline. The word can bring fear, shame or admiration from us mere mortals when we hear the word! Contrary to popular thought, discipline is not a genetic trait that you inherit, but a skill that can be developed. And Saturn, the planet of self-control and longevity, is by your side today. Start by getting rid of the “junk in your trunk”–your emotional baggage, that is. With next week’s full moon in your sign, you don’t want anything holding you back.

"
9911,16 july 2017,capricorn,"You may be determined to get to the bottom of something, but that doesn’t mean that others are willing to spill what they know or what they’re up to. Likewise, cooperation from people around you could be limited. That’s OK–stop worrying about the agendas of other people and focus on your own.

"
9912,16 july 2016,capricorn,"“If you want my body, and you think I’m sexy, come on sugar, let me know.” Paging Rod Stewart, circa 1978! Oh yeah, you’ve got the goods, Capricorn, so get out there and strut your stuff. A smokin’ conjunction between glam girl Venus and tell-it-like-it-is Mercury in your sexuality sector makes you the talk of the town. Work it.

"
9913,17 july 2017,capricorn,"Nitpicking will get you nowhere today, so avoid the temptation to dissect everything as you search for hidden answers, flaws or the perfect solution. Otherwise you’re going to end up with paralysis via analysis.

"
9914,17 july 2016,capricorn,"With the approaching full moon in Capricorn on Tuesday, it’s time to wrap up issues and matters that need to be completed. The Moon is now in your twelfth house, the place where we trim the dead wood from our lives and take out the mental trash, metaphorically speaking. It forms a super angle with Uranus in your house of comfort and ease. The message? Close the door to the past and open up a new one. You won’t be taking the past with you as you move ahead.

"
9915,18 july 2017,capricorn,"Creating more structure through better habits will pay off in spades, Capricorn. You’re known as the hardest working sign of the zodiac but that doesn’t mean that all of your routines are productive. Working smart is better than working hard.

"
9916,18 july 2016,capricorn,"Who are you, really? And who do you want to become? With tomorrow’s full moon approaching in your first house of self-image and goals, you might be considering these kinds of thoughts. Metamorphic Pluto is standing in the wings, holding a deep conversation with the Moon today about your future prospects. The message? Let go of what’s weak, outdated, and no longer serving you. This could be anything from your habits to people and situations that don’t reflect the true you. One door is about to close…and a new one is about to open.

"
9917,19 july 2016,capricorn,"Yee-ha! Kick up your heels, Capricorn. Today’s full moon is in your  sign. That means that it’s all about you—your dreams, your plans, your self-image and esteem. This is the cosmos’s annual gift to you, kind of like New Year’s Eve in the middle of the year. So pour yourself a cocktail or some matcha and let your daydreams run wild as you plan the next six months of your life. One word of note: Uranus is kicking up dust, perhaps making you nervous about security. Do you have the guts to make changes and let the chips fall where they may?

"
9918,20 july 2017,capricorn,"Got something important to say to someone? Do it now, as two of the most mature and logical planets in the solar system, Mercury and Saturn, are well aspected.

Problem is, there are people around you now who can bring you the negative kind. It’s your life: choose the fun, juicy kind of drama over the soap opera variety.

"
9921,21 july 2016,capricorn,"The moon in Aquarius is leading you down a particular path. It’s the path to making mo’ money. But in order to reach your destination, you need to examine your values and expectations about the green stuff. Do you just want a “little cushion” to cover you if times get tough? Are you settling for whatever the boss doles out, because the idea of going after bigger money scares you? If that’s the case, mighty Jupiter is telling you to dream big. Time for an attitude adjustment!

"
9922,22 july 2017,capricorn,"You’re a focused creature to begin with, Capricorn, but now you’re going to be laser sharp. The Sun has just joined Mars in a sector that allows you to dig deep into anything: your finances, psyche, emotions and love life for starters. The same holds true for any business ideas that you have. Get ready for some intense research!

"
9923,22 july 2016,capricorn,"Now that the Sun is in Leo, you’re going to be focused on stability–financial and emotional. While El Sol will be in this part of your chart for the next four weeks, you need to wrap up any home-related issues first: obtaining a mortgage, finding a place to live, going after past child support or settling family disputes. Uranus is scheduled to go retrograde in your house of residential matters on the 29th, which could throw a monkey wrench into your plans.

"
9924,23 july 2017,capricorn,"The Leo new moon in one of the houses that governs your thoughts and emotions can help you get rid of tired, useless (and maybe even harmful) patterns that may be holding you back. Problem is, you seem to be holding on to them as if they were a security blanket. Just because they’ve been a part of your life for years doesn’t mean they should stick around!

"
9925,23 july 2016,capricorn,"Neptune is known as the artist’s muse, and today it’s bringing out the best in you. Whether you’re simply picking out a new duvet cover, planning your garden beds, or creating the next Great American Novel, inspiration will flow.

"
9931,26 july 2016,capricorn,"They say that practice makes perfect, but so does passion. The Moon is urging you to spend more time on the activities (and with the people) that make your heart sing.

9935,28 july 2016,capricorn,"With the Moon in Taurus opposing Mars, you may wonder if some of your hopes and wishes are ever going to materialize. This has been a theme running through your chart for awhile now, but it’s about to end. When Mars changes signs on August 2nd, things will start to move forward. Slowly at first, but then momentum builds.

"
9936,29 july 2017,capricorn,"Fortunately you’re not the type who needs someone else’s approval as you follow your life’s path. If someone isn’t supporting you, realize that it’s more about them than it is about you. Keep moving forward.

"
9937,29 july 2016,capricorn,"Should I stay or should I go? Erratic Uranus is now retrograde in your domestic sector for the next five months, and it will make you question whether you should relocate or stay put. Before you pick up and move to a new locale, give it plenty of thought, as this planet creates an on-again, off-again vibe. Relationships with family members could get wonky too as some might get lazy, wishy-washy or stubborn. With power broker Pluto in Capricorn, you won’t let them get off easily with their behavior.

Because that’s exactly what’s happening today in your house of partnerships. Even if you’ve never previously considered joining forces with another person in order to further your ambitions, think about it. It could be a life coach, social media expert or image consultant, not necessarily a standard business partner. Keep an open mind.

"
9941,31 july 2016,capricorn,"Pluto is trying to transform the way you look at the world, which includes the way you look at yourself and your relationships with others.

Well darling, you’re going to have to be the sane one over the next five months now that erratic Uranus has gone retrograde in your family sector.

Slow down, do less and pamper yourself more.

"
9949,4 august 2016,capricorn,"Recent planetary activity may have you feeling restless and unsure as to how to handle people in your circle, as well as your future plans.

Perhaps it’s a noisy neighbor finally moving out. A lover might commit or cut the drama. No matter what it is, greater peace of mind is the end result.

"
9957,8 august 2016,capricorn,"With Venus now in your expansive, optimistic ninth house, no doubt you’re ready to see forward movement in your life. Travel plans, going back to school, weddings, business launches, legal affairs–all of these (and more) can start to show improvement. The cosmos has been placing roadblocks in the way recently though, which may have created a sense of frustration. They are still in place today, but tomorrow the logjam starts to break. In the meantime: patience.

"
9958,9 august 2017,capricorn,"You’re such a dedicated person, always charging forward in life, that you tend to lose touch of the real person deep inside of you. But today the planets give you the chance to connect with your inner spirit. Don’t worry–you can do this without losing control!

"
9959,9 august 2016,capricorn,"Recent planetary activity has made you unsure of a course of action, wondering whether your ideas and plans are realistic and attainable. Today the doubts begin to slip away and confidence appears. It will grow in the days ahead, and when Saturn goes direct on Saturday, you’ll swing into action. But keeping things on the downlow is the way to go.

"
9960,10 august 2017,capricorn,"Want to see more money in your wallet–and your bank account? Then it’s time to start hustling, as the recent eclipse was all about developing more security. A brilliant idea for a side business, passive income stream or partnership could come your way today–get ready to talk to others about it.

"
9961,10 august 2016,capricorn,"If there was ever a day to break out of a rut and initiate some major changes, this is it! A fabulous aspect between Mercury and Pluto will have your brain spinning with far-reaching ideas. And the best part? You’ll be able to pitch them or explain them to others. With Saturn in your confidentiality sector, however, you’re advised to keep them quiet for a bit longer. From the 17th on, there will be plenty of opportunities to go public.

"
9962,11 august 2017,capricorn,"Building a successful, firm financial foundation is the order of the day with a Sun-Jupiter connection. The recent eclipse was all about increasing your income, and today the planets want you to consider wealth-building strategies. Not just ways to pull in a few extra bucks; wealth.  

"
9963,11 august 2016,capricorn,"It seems like you have a number of ambitious plans either in action or under consideration, Capricorn. An auspicious Moon-Jupiter angle suggests that one could be quite profitable, especially if it involves technology, an app, a website or social media. Start working on it. The planets suggest that two heads are better than one right now, so team up with capable and discrete team members.

"
9964,12 august 2017,capricorn,"With so much planetary activity in your financial houses in August, you are probably raring to go when it comes to earning, saving and investing. However, Mercury retrogrades today in the house that governs “big plans”: going international with your business, for example, or trying to land media attention. This can actually be a blessing in disguise as it will force you to pay attention to the finer details before you eventually launch.

"
9965,12 august 2016,capricorn,"Adios, agendas. Buh-bye, bulls****rs. Take a number, oh toxic one. Capricorn is done  being a doormat, and if you have any doubts, just wait until Saturn goes direct tomorrow and they start cutting the dead wood from their lives. But today is the warm-up, as the emotional Moon swings past assertive Mars and logical Saturn. Yup, there’s a new Cap in town, pardner.

"
9966,13 august 2017,capricorn,"Serenity can often seem like an elusive quality, one that few people attain. But it’s yours for the taking with a fabulous Sun-Saturn trine, which is creating stability and peace in the deepest part of your psyche. Will it require tossing out old ways of thinking? Yes—that’s what enlightenment is all about.

"
9967,13 august 2016,capricorn,"Phew. Take a deep breath, sturdy goat–Saturn, your ruler, moves direct today after five months of spinning backward in the heavens through the most sensitive and psychological part of your chart. No doubt you’ve done a lot of thinking, which may have taken you down some bumpy mental roads. Hopefully you’ve come to realize what (and who) needs to stay in your life, and what needs to go. Let the fresh new changes begin.

"
9968,14 august 2017,capricorn,"Just how much more of yourself do you want to put into a key relationship? Some goats are willing to immerse themselves even more, while others may feel like pulling back a bit. The choice is yours. It really comes down to how strong you feel in the union.

"
9969,14 august 2016,capricorn,"Like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, you’re ready for a new beginning. Saturn’s five-month retro turn ended yesterday, and you spent all of that time in cocoon land, building the DNA for a transformation. Just don’t get discouraged if things don’t take off like a rocket. Venus opposes Neptune, indicating that you still have some thought patterns that need to change in order to move ahead.

"
9970,15 august 2017,capricorn,"You’re in a cosmic place right now in which you’re trying to figure out just how much “mental real estate” you want to devote to other people and their problems. A part of you suggests being a giver, while another part warns you to give them the space to figure things out on their own. When Saturn goes direct on the 25th you’ll have it figured out.

"
9971,15 august 2016,capricorn,"You may be on the fence about which direction to head in with a particular issue. A Saturn-Neptune square may be causing you to second guess yourself. But a power lunch between the Moon and Pluto in your sign signifies that logical thinking will win out in the end. However, doing things the same old way isn’t favored, so start thinking out of the box.

"
9972,16 august 2017,capricorn,"You need to get caught up on a lot of tasks, and the Moon is in a very motivational spot. The key to succeeding is to stay away from endless trawling on the internet, chatting on social media, texting your friends and gabbing on the phone. Next week’s eclipse will find you focusing like a laser beam, so today is good practice!

"
9973,16 august 2016,capricorn,"Over the next few days your desire for taking a chance may clash with your interest in maintaining a secure foundation, but this is actually a good problem! A fortuitous trine today between the Sun and Uranus could bring some positive financial news or opportunities that will help you increase your bottom line. Tomorrow, another happy trine encourages you to push past previous limits. You can  have your cake and eat it too.

"
9974,17 august 2017,capricorn,"With diplomatic Venus in your house of partnerships, you’re in a good place to play well with others. Problem is, they may not be feeling that kind of team spirit. Don’t be surprised if someone tries to pull rank or gets bossy in some way. The good news is that this passes quickly, and by the weekend you’re back on track.

"
9975,17 august 2016,capricorn,"It’s decision time, Capricorn. With Mars and Saturn moving ever closer in your house of boundaries, you’re going to make some key determinations about what needs to stay in your life and what needs to go. And today the cosmos delivers one heck of a gift–a trine between Venus and Pluto, which will open up your eyes to new possibilities. The lights ahead are all green–step on the gas!

"
9976,18 august 2017,capricorn,"There has been a lot of cosmic energy over the past few weeks that may have found you desiring more freedom in an alliance. Today, though, the planets are aligned in such a way that you can get back on the same page with someone. Open up and find out what it’s going to take to make this work.

"
9977,18 august 2016,capricorn,"Payday! Who doesn’t love that word? Well, that’s what the cosmos has in mind for you today, Capricorn, as a glistening full moon occurs in your house of income. You could be wrapping up interviews for a new job or getting ready to make a big change, such as changing fields or going the entrepreneurial route. A happy Sun-Uranus aspect indicates that whatever you’re working on has a strong profit potential. Surprising support could come from someone you wouldn’t expect.

"
9978,19 august 2016,capricorn,"It’s time to take a step back and examine some long term plans or goals. Something’s gotta give, because you may have taken on more than you can handle. Performing excellent work is a hallmark of your sign; fast and sloppy results don’t cut it. Remove unnecessary or time-consuming commitments and tasks from your daily routine if you want to move ahead with more efficiency–and serenity.

"
9979,20 august 2016,capricorn,"Ambitious plans are getting ready to take off, Capricorn! Intelligent Mercury is holding conversations with optimistic Jupiter in your expansive ninth house, and Venus intends to lend a helping hand. When the fiery Sun barrels in to Virgo to meet them on Monday, it’s blue skies ahead. But a Moon-Venus opposition today may be challenging your confidence. If you pay attention to the details of your goals or projects, the big picture will take care of itself.

"
9980,21 august 2016,capricorn,"An interesting mix of planetary angles is urging you to take a gamble on living differently, yet other planets are telling you to take the same old comfortable route. With Saturn and Mars moving closer to each other in the heavens, you’re going to have to make a decision: safety or spontaneity? Tried and true or something new? Wednesday it all comes together.

"
9981,22 august 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes life seems to offer us very little when it comes to choices, but then at other times we can be overwhelmed by possibilities. And you, Capricorn, are about to enter a sweet period in which picking which path to go down is going to be tough, as choices abound. (We should all have such difficulties!) That’s because the mighty Sun enters Virgo today, your expansive house of travel, study, entrepreneurship and adventure. It joins three other benevolent planets whose goal it is to point out experiences that will help you grow and enjoy life more.

"
9982,23 august 2016,capricorn,"Snip! Get out the scissors, Capricorn. Or maybe you need a power saw. The meeting of Mars and Saturn tomorrow is momentous, as it is encouraging you to cut the dead wood from your life. It’s time to get real, be kind to yourself, and dump bad habits and associations. Today the Moon is in fine form, signaling these two from your house of ingenuity. Creative solutions are on the way: grab them and use them!

"
9983,24 august 2016,capricorn,"“The quiet mind is richer than a crown.” This old saying pretty much sums up what today’s aspects are all about, Capricorn. A momentous meeting between Mars and Saturn helps you dump the toxic trash from your mind once and for all. It’s time for peace, serenity and contentment, but only you can make that happen. Get real about what’s not working and then start snipping away. People, habits and situations that take away from the quality of your life need to be dealt with.

"
9984,25 august 2016,capricorn,"It’s time to take a good long look at the way you go about handling your daily grind, both at work and at home. The planets indicate that you need better habits and systems in place. Be brutally honest with yourself. Do you waste too much time trawling the net? Should you hire someone to come in and clean rather doing it yourself? Are you waiting til the last minute to hand in work assignments? Everyone can become more efficient (yeah, I’m talking to you, Martha Stewart). Find hacks that simplify your routine. Serenity will be the happy result.

"
9985,26 august 2016,capricorn,"Are your thoughts jumping around like a chimpanzee? If you’ve ever tried to meditate you know what “monkey mind” is all about. Yup, mindfulness ain’t as easy as it sounds, and today’s Mars-Neptune square will point that out. The good news is that both Mars and Saturn in the house of your subconscious mind are  trying to bring you more peace. But Neptune is churning up the waves, making it hard to reach that “mind like water” place. Just slow down and tell that monkey to take a hike.

"
9986,27 august 2016,capricorn,"It’s time to broaden your horizons, in more ways than one. A positive meeting today between optimistic Jupiter and magnetic Venus encourages you to open up your mind to fresh new circumstances and people. New love could be coming your way, someone who’s not cut from the usual old cloth. You may be feeling quite entrepreneurial too, considering ways to expand your influence and income. An eclipse next week on the 1st will put rocket boosters under your plans.

"
9987,28 august 2016,capricorn,"Work smarter, not harder. That’s the message from the cosmos today as the North Node of the moon squares Mars and Saturn. Putting in 80 hours a week, exerting more effort than all of your co-workers or doing all the grunt work at home by yourself isn’t going to get you anywhere, other than tired and fed up. There’s no glory in being a martyr or a workhorse. Change your MO.

"
9988,29 august 2016,capricorn,"Ambitious new plans can be kicked off, thanks to easy peasy Venus entering your house of career and success. But Mercury goes retrograde tomorrow in your house of long-range planning, indicating that you need to take a few steps back and review everything before you leap in. A solar eclipse on Thursday will help you research your options and solidify your strategy.

"
9989,30 august 2016,capricorn,"Your career is about to take a quantum leap ahead over the next year as major planets are getting ready to enter that part of your chart. No doubt about it, the next thirteen months will be monumental if you work with the planetary energies on offer. The change has just begun with profitable Venus just entering your ambition sector. Mercury retrogrades, though, in the house of expansion, indicating that before you kick off a grandiose strategy or game plan that you have all the details figured out first.

"
9990,31 august 2016,capricorn,"As the mysterious moon glides into Virgo your brain will start dreaming up some pretty interesting scenarios for the future. Some might call them fantasies, but hey–you’re a freakin’ realistic Capricorn! Veering into Lala Land is not how you operate. So continue to dream, but back up your plans with a solid strategy. Mercury being retrograde in your expansive ninth house will actually help you with this.

"
9991,1 september 2016,capricorn,"Visionary. That’s the best way to describe you these days, thanks to a bevy of planets in your enterprising house of expanded perspectives. To top it off, a zinger of a solar eclipse occurs in the same part of the sky today, making you the guy or the gal with the sharp ideas. Publishing, media, lecturing, the travel circuit and entrepreneurship are all favored under these aspects. Got a message you want to get out there? Don’t hold back.

"
9992,2 september 2016,capricorn,"It’s not enough to think big, which you’ll be doing today as clever Mercury holds a powwow with go-big-or-go-home Jupiter. You need to consider plans from all angles. As famed architect Mies van der Rohe said, “God is in the details” and he ought to know. In building a masterpiece, whether it’s a skyscraper or your future, focusing on the small stuff is just as important as the goal.

"
9993,3 september 2016,capricorn,"Hmm, someone’s feeling frisky and powerful this weekend, and it’s a Capricorn! The passionate Moon is amping up your mojo both in love and business. You’ll be willing to take risks and show the world just what you’ve got going on in that brain and heart of yours. The recent eclipse was all about living a bigger life. Might as well start now!

"
9994,4 september 2016,capricorn,"You’re on the verge of some Seriously Big Stuff, Capricorn. Lucky Jupiter is about to enter your house of ambition and success for the first time in 13 years, a life changing situation. But in order to finesse this amazing time period (which will last into October of 2017), you need to step into your own  power. Will you have to please bosses and clients and other people? Of course. But you can do so and maintain your own sense of authority at the same time.

"
9995,5 september 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes the best way to develop a position of strength is to be as low key as possible, and that’s what the planets are suggesting, Capricorn. There’s no need to be loud and proud or to dazzle others with your brilliance. As long as you know that you have the chops, that’s all it takes. With Saturn and Mars in the most reclusive, secretive part of your chart, true power lies in not letting people know that you have it.

"
9996,6 september 2016,capricorn,"You’re usually the careful sort, not taking risks without thinking them through first. An amazing aspect tomorrow between the Sun and Pluto bodes well for launching big plans and initiatives, but make sure that you double check all the details before you proceed. With Mercury retrograde in your house of expansion, everything needs to be clarified. That being said, plans that were shelved awhile back may come back to life–in a big way.

"
9997,7 september 2016,capricorn,"It’s so easy to get caught up in the minutiae of our daily grind that we fail to see the big picture. This is especially true of the hard working goat, whose nose is so stuck to the grindstone that they forget what they’re aiming for! That’s about to change. The Sun forms a spectacular trine with Pluto today, opening your eyes to future possibilities. But it’s more than that—you’re changing as a person, becoming more authoritative and wiser with every day. When Jupiter enters your ambition sector this Friday, ain’t nothin’ gonna stop this goat.

"
9998,8 september 2016,capricorn,"Powerful forces are at work in the quiet recesses of your mind, making you question what path to follow next, especially in your career. With the Moon, Mars and Saturn all behind closed doors in a meeting on this topic, give yourself time to ruminate about your options. But with Neptune in a tricky angle, keep your plans to yourself, at least for now.

"
9999,9 september 2016,capricorn,"Everyone’s going to be jellin’ over you, Capricorn, so get used to the green-eyed monsters out there! Lucky Jupiter just entered your house of ambition and success for the first time since 2005, making you the most likely sign to hit the ball out of the park when it comes to your career and other major goals. Nothing is going to stop you, as the experiences of the past year taught you to think out of the box and not settle for less.

"
10000,10 september 2016,capricorn,"Reality check! Stern Saturn squares murky Neptune today, demanding that we are realistic and not operating on fantasy. In your case, Capricorn, pay close attention to the words spoken or written by others. They may be hiding something. The ringed planet is in your house of intuition, so if your gut is telling you that something’s off, it probably is.

"
10001,11 september 2016,capricorn,"You may feel befuddled today as a square between Venus and Pluto puts you in the midst of some serious soul-searching. Who are you, anyway, and what do you stand for? Now that Jupiter is in your authoritative tenth house you’re going to want to take more control over your life. Now’s a good time to think about it.

"
10002,12 september 2016,capricorn,"Lucky goat! Abundant Jupiter just glided into your house of ambition and success, setting up a year ahead for hitting your targets. And today the fiery Sun and intelligent Mercury hold a meeting about how to expand into new areas, whatever that means to you. But Pluto is in a tough spot from your house of confidentiality, which means that you need to protect valuable ideas and share them with only the most trusted confidantes.

"
10003,13 september 2016,capricorn,"You’re about to enter a phase in life in which you’re going to feel like a sponge, soaking up as much information as you can. Friday’s lunar eclipse will make you hunger for knowledge. Today, however, you could feel stymied as pieces of information you need just aren’t coming your way as easily as you’d like. This will pass, and the 20th is a super day for getting down to the nitty gritty about a situation.

"
10004,14 september 2016,capricorn,"Sports psychologist Dr. Jim Loehr has worked with some of the greatest athletes of our time, from tennis players to Olympians. One of the key things he discovered that, if equipped with the same degree of talent, the athlete who goes on to become a champion has set up routines and habits that they stick to religiously. And that’s what the cosmos is telling you to today. Whether it’s weight loss, remaining calm around your kids or getting through the projects on your desk, you need to establish successful protocols.

"
10005,15 september 2016,capricorn,"Words and ideas that have building up inside of you are reaching a point where they should be expressed, Capricorn. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in the communications part of your chart will light a fire under you to say what’s on your mind, whether it’s a talk with a friend or finally writing that book. But today murky Neptune may be clouding your thoughts. Hold off a bit before getting out ideas out there.

"
10006,16 september 2016,capricorn,"You’re in the driver’s seat, Capricorn. Lucky Jupiter entered your career house back on the 9th, setting up a year in which you can take your ambitions to the stratosphere. And the best way to do that? Shout it from the mountaintops: your talent, skills, work history. A lunar eclipse today in your communications sector is perfect for self-promotion, blogging, teaching, advertising and hitting the lecture circuit, not to mention performing research on your area of expertise.

"
10007,17 september 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes getting your feelings out there is about a comfortable as detonating a bomb. Other times it’s as smooth as silk. Fortunately, a happy Mars-Uranus trine today lets you get things off your chest with as little drama as possible. You may not be planning on having a talk, but something could happen that will suddenly open the door to discussion.

"
10008,18 september 2016,capricorn,"You may find it hard to focus on your goals and ambitions as a Venus-Uranus opposition takes place in the heavens. It’s possible that family members and others are vying for your attention, and you could also be taking your job home with you. When the Sun enters Libra on Thursday, however, you’ll be as focused as a laser beam.

"
10009,19 september 2016,capricorn,"Get ready to shed your skin, Capricorn. A new person is about to merge from the person that was previously you! Mars, in the most reflective part of your chart, is shaking you up to consider your options. It forms a magnificent angle with Venus in your house of ambition and success. Just get out of your own way and let some changes take place.

"
10010,20 september 2016,capricorn,"Thinking about going back to school, traveling the world or expanding your mind through philosophy or metaphysics? Maybe you want to expand your reach in the business world, such as going international or creating an online store. If that’s the case, you’re in luck. A fortuitous trine between Mercury and Pluto allows you to research your options. By Friday you’ll have a clearer picture as to your next move.

"
10011,22 september 2016,capricorn,"Ready to make some serious progress with your ambitions? Good, because the Sun has just entered the most success oriented part of your chart where it will remain for four weeks. El Sol will join abundant Jupiter, making this one of your most auspicious times in over a decade to kick butt. These two join forces on the 26th, your best day of the year for advancement.

"
10012,23 september 2016,capricorn,"Hmmm…is it wise to partner up with someone in business? That’s the question today as the Moon squares Jupiter, one of the planets that governs profits. Right now powerful Pluto is retrograde in your sign, making you question your work environment and the people you do business with. When it goes direct next Monday things will become more clear.

"
10013,24 september 2016,capricorn,"You have just entered a highly productive time in which you can advance in just about any area of your choosing. Mercury and Pluto are both encouraging you to explore new paths that you may not have considered in the past. The question is whether you should travel alone or take a partner with you. Consider the pros and cons.

"
10014,25 september 2016,capricorn,"With Jupiter and the Sun moving ever closer in the cosmos your sense of authority and personal power should be on the rise. Today the Moon is encouraging you to examine some of your deepest feelings and emotions, especially those that may have held you back in the past. However, you may want to keep these thoughts to yourself, as it seems that a friend might not be on board with the newer and more focused Capricorn you’re becoming.

"
10015,26 september 2016,capricorn,"Sweet! Lucky (and profitable) Jupiter meets up with the Sun only once a year, and today’s the day. They’re discussing your future–specifically, your career and other big ambitions. The next 12 months are the best in over a decade to make progress, and the seeds you plant today could bear some pretty impressive fruit. A new moon in the same part of the sky this Saturday can catapult you to a whole new playing field.

"
10016,27 september 2016,capricorn,"No one had better get in a Capricorn’s way over the next seven weeks! They might get run over, not because the fearless goat is being mean or inconsiderate, but because you are going to be more powerful than a tornado. First up: Pluto has been retrograde in Capricorn for five months, forcing you to analyze just about every aspect of your life. Where are you giving your power away? What flaws or problematic issues need to be addressed or removed? Well, Pluto just went direct. Secondly: Mars blasts into your sign today for the first time in two years, providing you with ambition and energy to spare. These aspects are a gift from the cosmos, Cappie. Go for it!

"
10017,28 september 2016,capricorn,"If you’re in the process of planning something big, such as your wedding, attending college or taking a long trip overseas, make sure that you have all of your facts straight and the details spelled out. Even if your life is just “business as usual” you need to keep your eye on the small stuff, as it appears that a source may not be giving you the straight story about important details.

"
10018,29 september 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes we need a swift kick in the pants to get us out of our comfort zone and into a new place that pushes up against old boundaries. Well, Uranus is the butt kicker of the cosmos and today it’s telling you to stretch a bit. It looks like you need to reevaluate your plans and ideas, and make them bigger and bolder than before.

"
10019,30 september 2016,capricorn,"Your ambitions will be center stage over the next few weeks, so by all means get moving with whatever big plans you have in mind. But keep your lips zipped about what you’re up to as a tense Saturn-Neptune aspect demands discretion. You also need to make sure that you’re getting the straight story from others as Neptune could be blowing a lot of smoke in your direction.

"
10020,1 october 2016,capricorn,"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! Capricorns are the most fired-up sign in the zodiac as today’s new moon occurs in your house of fame, honor and success. This may easily be your best new moon in over 10 years for initiating activities that will help you reach your ambitions, whatever they may be. A sexy Venus-Neptune trine also makes this weekend a honey for romance. With Venus in your house of big dreams and Neptune in the communications sector, it’s an auspicious time to talk to your lover about where your relationship is heading. Singles: online dating sites and introductions from friends are your best way to go right now.

"
10021,2 october 2016,capricorn,"Expanding your contacts should be at the top of your list over the next few weeks, especially when it comes to furthering your career. Don’t just consider the tried and true, or the people in your own back yard. There may be valuable insights to be gleaned from folks in other industries or geographic areas. Keep an open mind and expect valuable wisdom to come your way.

"
10022,3 october 2016,capricorn,"Diplomacy is a skill that some people have mastered and others have not. You may need to finesse this skill this week, as planets are putting you in a position of authority. Whether you’re being offered a leadership position or you’re quietly becoming a force to be reckoned with behind the scenes, other  authority figures may start viewing you as a threat. And rightly so. Your talents won’t be kept hidden for long.

"
10023,4 october 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes the best way to impress someone is to sit back, say little and let your talent speak for itself. A powerful Sun-Saturn aspect puts your talents in front of others and the best part is, you may not even realize it. Yet. You’re in a magnificent career phase right now, so despite today’s energy you should still be (ever so subtly) promoting your skills.

"
10024,5 october 2016,capricorn,"A friend, mentor or trusted confidante could provide you with feedback today that could change your life in a big way. Perhaps they make you realize that you’ve got your s*** together more than you realized, or they helpfully point out a direction you should be heading in. If in doubt about something open up to someone, and let them help you “reboot” your attitude.

"
10025,6 october 2016,capricorn,"Steer clear of authority figures if you can over the next few days, as a tough Mars-Jupiter aspect could create some flak. The reality is that you are becoming a much more potent figure in your career, or that you’re really ready to hunker down and go after some big ambitions. Which is good—but you run the risk of pushing up against a power broker. Find a balance between attainment of your own goals while pleasing the muckety-mucks.

"
10026,7 october 2016,capricorn,"Virgos have a reputation for being the list makers, organizers and control freaks of the zodiac, but over the next few weeks Capricorns are going to have them beat. With the Sun and Jupiter forming a formidable team in your tenth house of ambition, nothing is going to get in your way. And today intelligent, perceptive Mercury joins them, providing you with even more mental acuity for going after your goals. One caveat though: strong-willed Pluto is in Capricorn, making you as forceful and determined as a Sherman tank. Just don’t roll over everyone, squashing them as you confidently move ahead.

"
10027,8 october 2016,capricorn,"Stay out of Cappie’s way today! No, they’re not angry or rude. Just highly motivated. The passionate Moon is in their sign, swinging past Mars and Pluto, helping them reduce inertia and gain momentum as they move forward with their audacious plans. Better yet is that inspirational Neptune is in a super angle from their house of thinking and self-expression, allowing them to communicate their ideas with fervor and eloquence.

"
10028,9 october 2016,capricorn,"A sudden burst of cosmic wisdom may jolt you into reconsidering just who you are and where you’re going in life. Complacency, being in a rut, doing things the same old way–it’s time to move away from the tried and true and take a risk. Metamorphic Pluto in your sign demands it, and with Mars by its side, you’ll have the energy to make some seriously big changes.

"
10029,10 october 2016,capricorn,"Some positive planetary aspects are lining up to help you feel more secure, both financially and emotionally. The Moon is in your house of self-esteem today, signaling abundant Jupiter in your house of authority. The phrase “fake it til you make it” comes to mind. But with so much cosmic fire power backing you up, you won’t be faking it for long.

"
10030,11 october 2016,capricorn,"It’s not enough to have a plan, scheme or a dream—often times you need to discuss it, promote it, and yes, plan it. An auspicious meeting today between Mercury and Jupiter helps you focus on your grandest ambitions in a big way—then put pen to paper and draw up a battle plan. A helpful meeting between Mars and Neptune provides you with the drive and the communications skills to then venture forth. It’s not often that you can size the brass ring like this—work it!

"
10031,12 october 2016,capricorn,"As the vibey Moon moves closer to Neptune, your intuitive powers are increasing. You may be questioning a close connection, such as a friend or a person who’s part of a group you’re involved with. If you suspect that something is off, keep it to yourself. Just sit back and observe.

"
10032,13 october 2016,capricorn,"Paralysis by analysis? Your brain may be so busy churning over details and possible scenarios that you can’t see clearly. Right now you have more drive to achieve than just about any other sign of the zodiac, but there is such a thing as pushing too hard. Your batteries may be run down: take some time to recharge them this weekend.

"
10033,14 october 2016,capricorn,"New Age gurus like to talk about “fear of success”, but people of the Capricorn persuasion aren’t afraid of getting ahead. That being said, we all have thought patterns and habits that can get in our way when we’re trying to make progress. Be honest with yourself and identify what might be holding you back. With go-getter Mercury in your house of ambition forming a super angle with disciplined Saturn in the habits sector, you can cut through the roadblocks and move ahead.

"
10034,15 october 2016,capricorn,"It may be time to step away from your responsibilities, if just for a day or two. You’ve been pushing so hard that you may be neglecting people and activities that are essential. Like: sleep, doing the laundry, talking to friends, relaxing with a good book or a movie, or balancing your checkbook. People close to you may be getting cranky, and you also run the risk of burnout. Chill.

"
10035,16 october 2016,capricorn,"It seems that you need to tend to your home life, Capricorn, a necessary situation brought on by today’s full moon. Even if you’re single you may still have family or house-related issues to manage. Rebellious Uranus is acting up, suggesting that a family member, roommate or landlord could throw you a curve ball. But there could also be a happy and unexpected event that takes place, such as a pregnancy or declaration of love. With all the hours you’ve been putting into chasing down your goals, you need some down time too—by all means take it and recharge your batteries.

"
10036,17 october 2016,capricorn,"Your focus and determination are building, Capricorn, as a series of powerful and metamorphic planetary aspects bless you with extraordinary vision about your future. Today a super moon-Pluto angle brings out your creativity and talent and the desire to hone your skills. Outside matters (and people) may even seem superfluous, but this can be a good thing. You can’t afford to sweat the small stuff these days.

"
10037,18 october 2016,capricorn,"A secret weapon is just about ready to be placed in your hands, Capricorn! Your aspects for going after your goals and passions is amazing, courtesy of hosting Mars and Pluto in your sign. Your motivation and discipline are sky rocketing. And now Venus traipses into your hush-hush house of intuition for a three-week stay, ramping up your ability to figure out what smart move to make next. Pay close attention to your dreams and gut hunches–they can take you to a much higher level of living.

"
10038,19 october 2016,capricorn,"Today can go one of two ways: “wow!” or “ow!”  That’s because two heavy hitters, Mars and Pluto, are meeting up in your sign. If you use this energy wisely, you can cast away doubts, fears and concerns about being not good enough, and instead morph into a force of nature. But if you overstep your bounds you might crush other people, who will no doubt then have you in their crosshairs. Think Jedi knight and use your skills for the greater good (even if it’s just your own good) rather than for trouble. Personal power is a sword that can cut two ways.

"
10039,20 october 2016,capricorn,"You may have come to the realization lately that you need to get your emotions and thoughts under control. The recent full moon highlighted the need to release mood swings and negative thinking. Today, a tough Mercury-Uranus angle repeats this message—so pay attention! Fortunately Mars and Pluto are determined to clear the cobwebs from your brain and to turn you into a peaceful warrior.

"
10040,21 october 2016,capricorn,"Recent planetary aspects have turned you into something of a Lone Ranger, so focused are you to make progress with your life. Is there room for romance or a new business alliance? That question may be on your mind with a Moon-Mars-Pluto opposition. It’s also possible that an existing partner is getting a bit peeved by a lack of attention coming from your general direction. This will pass quickly, but know that once the Sun rolls into Scorpio later this week, you’ll be feeling a lot more social.

"
10041,22 october 2016,capricorn,"You’ve been working hard, Capricorn, and now it’s time to rejoin the human race in a more social way! The Sun has just entered Scorpio, your eleventh house of camaraderie. Make plans to get together with your friends, search for love via a pal (and online is auspicious these days too). The eleventh house governs the digital world, so those Caps with an online business can make some big strides over the next four weeks. Network at trade events and attend seminars to sharpen your skills. But don’t forget that all work and no play is going to make for one boring and tired goat. Book some time to let your hair down and party.

"
10042,23 october 2016,capricorn,"Some big goals appear to need readjusting under today’s planetary influences. This doesn’t mean tossing them out or giving up; rather, a simple review and reframing if necessary. The good news is that the two most inspirational planets, Jupiter and Neptune, are by your side, blessing you with insight and creativity. And that may be just what your plans need—a dollop of artistic flair or an illuminating viewpoint.

"
10043,24 october 2016,capricorn,"Power up your iPhone and get ready to start networking. Now that Mercury has just joined the Sun in your house of friends and business contacts, the time is right for mingling with like minded people. This holds true for volunteer and charity work, so if you’ve been considering lending your time and talent to a worthy cause, go for it. Attend seminars, go to church, throw a party and schedule some brunches. It’s all good.

"
10044,25 october 2016,capricorn,"Don’t hear what you want to hear today, nor should you schmooze people with insincere remarks just to gain favor with them. A deceptive Venus-Neptune angle indicates that talk will be cheap today. Make sure that you’re not cheapening your  words! Likewise, read between the lines when you hear or read a statement from someone close, as there could be confusion or deliberate obfuscation there.

"
10045,26 october 2016,capricorn,"This is your best year in over a decade for career advancement, and today brings a profitable meeting between the two most generous and profitable planets. Jupiter is helping you go after your most closely held goals, and Venus in your intuitive twelfth house is providing inspiration. Someone may be interested in helping you too, such as a colleague, friend or mentor. Tomorrow is perfect for making contacts.

"
10046,27 october 2016,capricorn,"Dream on. That’s the message from the cosmos–to dream big, focus on your fondest hopes and wishes. Today is the perfect time to create practical plans for achieving them with a lustrous Sun-Mercury conjunction. Mercury brings its intelligence and perception to the table; the Sun brings authority and ambition. With dynamic Mars and Pluto striding through your first house of the self, your goals should be in the forefront of your mind. Go after them.

"
10047,28 october 2016,capricorn,"You may be getting frustrated with trying to get through to the same people, over and over again. How many times do you have to repeat something? Mars in your sign could make you feel a bit annoyed, and with a Moon-Jupiter angle you might want to take control of a situation. But is it worth it? Or is it going to be the same old drama, just rehashed? Some things just aren’t worth the time and the effort.

"
10048,29 october 2016,capricorn,"Put a fork in it–it’s done! That may be your battle cry today as Venus and Saturn form a powerful conjunction in the heavens. They meet in the house of your subconscious mind, an auspicious placement for finally releasing negative thoughts, bad habits and worn out dramas. The wonderful thing is that Saturn is all about making things stick, such as newer, happier thought patterns, and Venus is all about ease.

"
10049,30 october 2016,capricorn,"A new moon in the house that governs your deepest desires occurs today, Capricorn, and it’s a honey. While it may often seem like achieving our wishes is a bumpy road full of detours and roadblocks, this lunation makes things flow as smooth as silk. That’s because serene Venus is in a superb angle, easing the way. And Neptune, planet of inspiration, fires up your imagination from its perch in your house of thinking and expression. Take this golden new moon and run with it!

"
10050,31 october 2016,capricorn,"Your relationships with others need to be examined, Capricorn, as the planets want you to be more circumspect about the company you keep. Whether it’s friends, co-workers, neighbors, family or a lover, you need to know where you stand. If you feel uneasy about someone’s motives or feelings, pay attention to your gut as it should be right on target. Determine to associate only with people who fill you up–not with those who drag you down.

"
10051,1 november 2016,capricorn,"Inspiration can come from many places, and with Neptune active today, your brain may be buzzing with ideas. The watery planet holds a meeting with the Sun about how you can live a more authentic life. The Sun is in your technology sector, so trawl the Internet for ideas—for home decor, fashion, travel spots to visit, languages you’d like to learn, or business ideas to pursue. Get some Pinterest boards going, buy a book, or listen to a podcast by someone who’s already doing what you’d like to achieve.

"
10052,2 november 2016,capricorn,"Your intuition should be right on target when it comes to assessing the behavior and agendas of the people around you. What they’re saying may not be what they’re thinking or planning, so read between the lines. Use your sixth sense to guide you when it comes to assessing your own game plans too, as you may be expecting things to materialize faster than they really will. A balance of logic and intuition can serve you well, Capricorn.

"
10053,3 november 2016,capricorn,"Your plans and dreams are under review by the cosmos, Capricorn. Pluto’s job is to point out areas of your life that need to be restructured, rebooted or tossed. Considering that this powerful little planet is in your house of self—your image, self-esteem and ambitions—just about anything in your life is up for grabs. Intelligent Mercury and Pluto hold a meeting today, asking that you create a short list of what needs to be changed. While you’re at it, make a bucket list of exciting adventures that you’d like to experience as well!

"
10054,4 november 2016,capricorn,"As the passionate Moon starts traveling through your sign, you may be feeling emotional, especially when it comes to assessing how far you’ve come in 2016. Don’t beat yourself up for not being exactly where you’d like to be. That’s about to change real soon, next week in fact. When magnetic Venus enters your sign on Friday the 11th things will gain momentum.

"
10055,5 november 2016,capricorn,"You may be tempted to toss out the old rule book that says that you have to live your life a certain way. It’s not surprising considering that maverick Uranus is acting up in the house that governs your sense of comfort and security. Are you ready to take a risk, one that will push you past the comfort zone? Pay attention to your gut, as Venus in your house of intuition is blessing you with the gift of insight.

"
10056,6 november 2016,capricorn,"Family ties are called “ties” for a reason. Sometimes your connections to your relatives can feel like a ball and chain–or maybe a noose! And this can occur even when certain family members are long gone, having crossed over to the other side. Uranus jolts you out of the past, allowing you to cut any mental cords that haven’t been pleasant. Even if you still have to deal with a particular person it doesn’t mean that they have the right to take your happiness away.

"
10057,7 november 2016,capricorn,"Over the past few months you’ve been considering what passion projects to pursue and what paths to take. But now it’s time to narrow down your choices and get to work on the ones that speak to your soul–and your wallet! Once Mars changes signs on Wednesday you need to be as focused as a laser beam.

"
10058,8 november 2016,capricorn,"With assertive Mars and transformative Pluto working side by side in your sign over the past 8 weeks, no doubt you’ve concerned yourself with some big plans for the future. You’re not the same person you were even earlier this year, and your goals and ambitions have probably changed. But now it’s time to focus on the “package”, the vessel that will be carrying you into the successful year ahead: your body. Venus enters Cap on Friday, urging you to nurture, protect and pamper that body of yours. And while you’re at it, there’s nothing wrong with a new hairstyle or treating yourself to some chic new clothes. Look and act the part of a winner!

"
10059,9 november 2016,capricorn,"Money machine! Get ready to start seeing a lot more green in the weeks and months ahead. You’ve been hard at work—now start cashing in. Megawatt Mars just entered your income sector for the first time since 2014. Push hard between now and the middle of December, holiday slowdowns be damned. A big boost comes from profitable Venus which enters your sign on Friday, making you (and your message) look like a winner.

"
10060,10 november 2016,capricorn,"A sparkling Moon-Neptune conjunction will help take ideas that have been rolling around in your head, and turn them into something perhaps even bigger than you had originally expected. Sometimes a small spark of an idea ignites a chain reaction that can help you take a brainstorm and run with it. Now is that time!

"
10061,11 november 2016,capricorn,"All eyes are on you now Capricorn—look and act the part of a winner! Now that Mars is charging forcefully through your let’s-make-some-money sector, you’re more than ready to seal some deals, launch businesses and start reaping the rewards of your hard work. But magnetic Venus enters your sign today, telling you to take some time out for pampering, a new hairstyle, some stylin’ clothes and a brand new attitude. Walk the walk and talk the talk.

"
10062,12 november 2016,capricorn,"Your birthday season may be weeks away yet, but the cosmos is already shining its light upon you. Gentle Venus glided into your sign yesterday, suggesting an image and attitude upgrade. And today candid Mercury hustles into the house of your subconscious mind, telling you to dump toxic thoughts so that you can move on to a much better place. Let’s get this early birthday party started now.

"
10063,13 november 2016,capricorn,"As Mercury swings through your house of intuition and inspiration for the next three weeks you should be paying attention to what your gut tells you. A super Mercury-Neptune aspect today is perfect for digging deep into the ocean of creativity and innovation. You may find some pearls of wisdom down there–grab them!

"
10064,14 november 2016,capricorn,"What about love? Today’s full moon in Taurus puts that question front and center. If you’re unhappy in romance, or unhappily single, the planets indicate that a new flame could be on the horizon, and a keeper at that. A strong Mars-Mercury aspect is trying to bring you security–not drama–in love. Someone may be crushing on you behind the scenes, by the way, so keep your radar turned up. And for those of you who are in satisfying relationships, this lunation could take your romance to the next level.

"
10065,15 november 2016,capricorn,"You may be raring to go with a business related project or a job offer, but confusing Neptune muddies up the waters today. It’s imperative that you understand all of the fine points of a deal before you sign or agree to terms. This holds true also for health care issues, such as an insurance policy or the expenses involved in a medical treatment–the kind that you  are responsible for. If possible, wait until early next week to finalize things.

"
10066,16 november 2016,capricorn,"Group dynamics at the office, or within a business relationship, may need some changes. It may simply be a change in attitude on your part about how to react to the nonsense that goes on. Uranus in your house of contentment is acting up, asking you what’s more important: being right, or being serene? If people aren’t willing to change there’s nothing you can do to force them.

"
10067,17 november 2016,capricorn,"You’re far less willing these days to put up with nonsense from other people, but blasting your opinions may not be the best way to go right now! Instead, why don’t you examine the emotions that are creating this lack of patience. While it may be true that people around you really are annoying, is there are more Zenlike way to deal with your reactions?

"
10068,18 november 2016,capricorn,"It’s one thing to day dream and another to become delusional. As Mercury stirs up your subconscious mind, escapist thoughts may arise. The problem is that Neptune may be clouding your vision, leading you to turn them into over-the-top full blown fantasies. Keep your feet on the ground today. Don’t act on anything in which you don’t know all of the facts.

"
10069,19 november 2016,capricorn,"It’s a sweet thing to be a Capricorn these days, as lovely Venus in your sign is amping up your charisma. If you’ve been considering a makeover or just a few minor tweaks to your looks—or your attitude!—then go for it. Now that Neptune has gone direct in your house of self-expression, people will be interested in what you have to say, what you put in writing, and any creative projects that you’ve been working on. Show the world that you’re a force to be reckoned with.

"
10070,20 november 2016,capricorn,"Despite the fact that the holiday season is just about to kick off, you might find yourself in a quieter frame of mind today. A helpful Moon-Uranus trine could be just the impetus you need to slow down and examine your thoughts, feelings and priorities. The planets are determined to bring you greater peace and serenity, something you can certainly use, considering that your ambitions are running sky high.

"
10071,21 november 2016,capricorn,"It’s time for some nurturing and relaxation, now that the Sun is in the most reflective part of your chart. This may sound impossible, or maybe impractical, with assertive Mars blazing a path through your income sector and Jupiter quite active in your house of ambition. But if you don’t slow down you run the risk of burning out. Not only that, taking things at a more relaxed pace will help you assess situations better for what they really are. Do less, and make more progress.

"
10072,22 november 2016,capricorn,"A lot of people talk about “owning your power”, or stepping into it, as if it’s a kind of force field. And in a sense, it is. But that doesn’t mean that it’s a magical entity that can slay dragons or operate like Jedi mind control. Today is a good time to step into your personal power quietly, without a lot of fanfare. If you want to own it, you need to ask yourself why you haven’t felt this way in the past. Once you’ve figured that out, it will be easy to maintain.

"
10073,23 november 2016,capricorn,"If your gut is telling you that something is off, it probably is—and you should be paying attention. Intelligent, quick thinking Mercury and rational Saturn both happen to be together in your vibey house of the subconscious mind and today they hold a powwow. As a result, you need to listen to your intuition and act on it. This is also the house of hush-hush matters, so it’s a super day to quietly apply for a new job, negotiate a business deal behind closed doors, or privately make decisions about your future without informing 27 of your closest friends. Really, does anyone need to know?

"
10074,24 november 2016,capricorn,"Who are you, really? And what is it that you want out of life? That’s the question the cosmos poses to you over the next few days as you try to sort out which path to head down. It’s not surprising that this dilemma has arisen, considering that Jupiter is now in your house of ambition for the first time in 13 years. The issue is that metamorphic Pluto is in your house of self-identity, making you wonder if you’re going after certain goals out of habit or because they’re what other people want you to do. Spend some quiet time this weekend considering your options.

"
10075,25 november 2016,capricorn,"Some major chapters in your life are coming to a close, Capricorn, but this is a good thing. You’re about to enter a phase in which you’re more in charge of your destiny than ever before. But this may not please others, as they don’t like the idea of you striking out on your own. Too bad. Your ambitions can not be denied, so forge ahead with your plans.

"
10076,26 november 2016,capricorn,"Your intuition is in fine form today, so pay attention to what passes through your mind. A sudden burst of inspiration could provide you with just the answers you seek to a situation that may have been niggling away to you for ages, especially if it has to deal with emotional security and peace of mind. You’re in a highly cathartic period with plenty of healing energy around you–take advantage of it.

"
10077,27 november 2016,capricorn,"It’s important this week to be brutally honest about what needs to stay in your life and what has to go. The new moon on Tuesday falls in your house of closure, and its goal is to clean house so that you can move on to a much better place. A smart thing to do today is to consider the effect that family matters, past and present, have on your moods and therefore your happiness. You can’t choose your relatives but you can control your attitude.

"
10078,28 november 2016,capricorn,"Doubts and fears about the present and future may be rattling your cage a bit, but this too shall pass. The problem is that unreliable Uranus is acting up in your house of security and comfort, making you wonder if you have what it takes to move ahead. You do indeed, and the doubts serve a useful purpose. Rushing into situations too quickly is not in your best interest, so it’s wise to be a bit reluctant.

"
10079,29 november 2016,capricorn,"They say that habits make the man (or the woman) and today’s new moon in Sagittarius asks you to reflect upon that statement. Our habits and rituals can make us or break us, and as this lunation falls in the house of the subconscious mind, you now have the opportunity to review practices that aren’t helping you move forward. Being honest with yourself is not always easy, but with optimistic Jupiter in your house of personal power, you can  change–for the better.

"
10080,30 november 2016,capricorn,"Blurt alert! Keep your lips zipped today and tomorrow as a tough Sun-Neptune aspect indicates that you could say the wrong thing. Perhaps it’s an opinion that will offend someone; maybe a secret slips that should have remained confidential. Your thoughts and intuition seem to be right on target, but the people around you may be living in Lala Land. That’s their problem. Keep it real and keep it to yourself.

"
10081,1 december 2016,capricorn,"Few signs of the zodiac work as hard as you do, Capricorn, and today brings a watershed moment. A turning point arises as go-getter Mars holds an important meeting with abundant Jupiter. All of the effort that you’ve been putting in is about to pay off, and you may see signs of this today or in the weeks ahead. Likewise, you may make a life changing decision to make a clean break from past goals, circumstances or situations that no longer serve you. With intelligent Mercury entering your sign tomorrow, you’ll be unstoppable.

"
10082,2 december 2016,capricorn,"Your official birthday season may be weeks away, but the planets are already lining up in your sign, getting you ready for a good year ahead. Today vivacious Mercury zips into Capricorn, helping you come up with solutions to problems, smart ideas to follow up on, and the ability to speak eloquently. You may consider a writing project, such as penning a novel or starting a blog. Perhaps a teaching or public speaking gig awaits you. Jazzing up your self-image is also on the menu as glam Venus happens to be in this house, so let the transformation begin.

"
10083,3 december 2016,capricorn,"It may be the weekend but your mind is on the almighty dollar. Maybe it’s because you’re doing your holiday shopping, or perhaps you’ve been hit with some unexpected expenses. Regardless as to the reason it’s time to start making bank, and serious Saturn has your back. Brainstorm ways that you can earn or save more, then set new habits in motion. When Venus changes signs next Wednesday you may be tempted to shop for luxury items, but hold back for now.

"
10084,4 december 2016,capricorn,"It may be a Sunday, a day of rest for many people, but the planets are pushing Capricorns to hustle, and for good reason. You’re in a pretty amazing place to go after your big dreams, with lucky Jupiter in your house of ambition and Mars in your income sector. Even if making money isn’t your #1 goal, Mars can help you develop the right routines for making things happen, such as losing weight and getting toned. Today these two work in tandem to bring you closer to what you’re envisioning.

"
10085,5 december 2016,capricorn,"Ancient peoples often set up “altars” at home. Some did this as a shrine to honor their ancestors, others viewed it as a practical way to bring worship into their daily lives. Today you might be inspired to create a special place where you can center yourself and find some peace. Checking in with your altar in the morning and evening could become a new habit that will surprise you with its benefits. Your life is about to become less erratic and more predictable–why not celebrate the serenity?

"
10086,6 december 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to get more focused on the things that mean the most to you. You may have been distracted lately; not a typical situation for the hard-working goat, but hey, it happens! Mercury is now direct in the part of your chart that deals with your most cherished dreams. Don’t put them off any longer.

"
10087,6 december 2016,capricorn,"Finding the cash to spend on home or family related expenses is not always easy, as these things can get expensive! But a happy Uranus-Mars aspect today suggests that you might stumble upon a way to finance something that you need or crave. Maybe it’s a 50% sale on that sofa you’ve been eyeing, or a home seller who’s desperate enough to take a low bid. Hunt down a great sale on Christmas and Hanukkah goodies for the family unit—bargains are out there.

"
10088,7 december 2016,capricorn,"The planets are firmly focused on your career, especially the habits that will make you successful—or not! Today can bring about a turn of events as magnetic Venus moves into the part of the sky that helps you establish winning ways. The full moon next Tuesday is all about closure and release, and that includes negative ideas about money and achievement. For now, consider what you need to do to make 2017 a financial and career success. Then begin making changes at the time of the full moon.

"
10089,8 december 2016,capricorn,"The cosmos is telling you that if one thing is necessary in your life right now, it’s order. Getting on top of your chores at home and the office is paramount, along with creating routines and systems that will streamline your daily grind. Greater serenity is one benefit, not to mention a potentially higher level of income. With Venus and Mars both in your earnings sector you can really boost your cash flow. The key is organization.

"
10090,9 december 2016,capricorn,"The ancient Taoist masters believed that the best way to go through life was to carefully control the flow of information to the outside world. They used the analogy of a seedling growing; it needs to be watered, receive nutrition and protected from getting trampled. Therefore, when launching a new venture, they advised to not draw attention to it, otherwise it may get trampled by competitors. That, grasshopper, is the message the cosmos has for you today. Work behind closed doors.

"
10091,11 december 2016,capricorn,"Taking good care of yourself shouldn’t be something you think about once a month, or worse, once a year! You need some extreme self-care, NOW. With so many planets in your houses of ambition, money and plowing through assignments and chores, you run the risk of burnout, not to mention being cranky. Make plans today to pamper and indulge yourself. Even if you can’t pull it off till next weekend, say, book it. You’re working too hard to not reward yourself.

"
10092,12 december 2016,capricorn,"Inner work. The cosmos demands that you take stock of your attitudes and philosophies, as it appears that something’s gotta give. Often times we can be our worst enemy, but you don’t have to be in that position. Nor do you need years of angst-ridden therapy. A sudden, energetic blast of fresh air may waft through your mind today, clearing out the cobwebs. Hallelujah!

"

It’s time to become a lot more organized and productive both at the office and at home. The problem is that you seem to have so many projects going that things are starting to fall through the cracks. Perhaps you’re spending too many late hours at work, not leaving enough time for keeping up with things at home. Regardless, with lucky Jupiter in your house of ambition til next October, the only way to reach your goals is to have a streamlined plan.

"
10094,14 december 2016,capricorn,"There could be a subtle undercurrent going on, making you wonder if you’re getting the straight story from people around you. Politics and game playing may be draining your energy, Capricorn, to the point where you just want to crawl into bed for a long winter’s nap. But have no fear: the sturdy goat will be back on the trail in no time! When the Sun enters your sign next week, your energy will return. As for the people around you, you’ll be so focused on your end game that you won’t even notice them.

"
10095,15 december 2016,capricorn,"You may be anxious to tackle things on your to-do list, not to mention your grander plans. But sometimes ya just gotta keep those home fires burning! Don’t neglect your family, lover or even yourself right now. If you do, you’ll hear about it from someone close. Your batteries seem to be in need of recharging too, so get some rest and slow down a bit. Don’t worry—when the Sun enters your sign next week, you’ll be operating at warp speed.

"
10096,17 december 2016,capricorn,"I always love it when I look at someone’s chart and realize that the cosmos is telling them to slow down and enjoy life, and that’s what the planets are saying to you today, Capricorn! Specifically they’re suggesting that you spend a little time and cash turning your home into a more serene and relaxing abode. Pick up some luscious bath bubbles and body lotion. Buy some comfy pillows for the sofa or some new sheets. If you’re really ambitious, create a special spot for doing yoga, meditating or indulging in your hobbies. Think “home spa” and you’ll have the right idea.

"
10097,18 december 2016,capricorn,"Your opinion of yourself is going to be under review in the weeks ahead, Capricorn. With both Mars and Venus occupying your house of self-worth, you’re in an excellent position to start feeling more positive. So why the doubts? The Moon in Leo is making you question if you have what it takes–to be a good lover or parent, to land the job, to score the success, to be serene and at peace. You do–and you will understand that after Mercury retrogrades in your sign tomorrow.

"
10098,19 december 2016,capricorn,"Your brain will be working double overtime in the next seven weeks, Capricorn! Megawatt Mars has just entered your house of thinking, speaking and all forms of self-expression. This is a super placement for inventing, writing, drawing, blogging, teaching and coming up with smart business ideas. The only problem is that Mercury retrogrades in your sign for three weeks. The message? Brainstorm away but do your research before you go public with new plans.

"
10099,20 december 2016,capricorn,"Your energy level should be rising as your celestial birthday season approaches. Start thinking about what you’d like to experience in the year ahead, which may involve doing less, rather than more. With serious Saturn in your house of closure and trimming the excess, perhaps you need to remove yourself from certain obligations and activities in order to focus on a critical few.

"
10100,21 december 2016,capricorn,"A drumroll, please…the Sun enters Capricorn today! The next four weeks are literally your days in the Sun, as it spotlights what is most important to you. Get a handle on what you’d like to experience over the next year, as things can start moving rapidly as early as next week. If your energy level is low, do whatever it takes to recharge those batteries. The cosmic aspects are too positive to be squandered. Saturday is the perfect time to chill out and heal with a rare Saturn-Uranus aspect.

"
10101,22 december 2016,capricorn,"How can you fit in all of your aspirations and still find time for yourself and the people you love? That’s the question today as the passionate Moon meets up with Jupiter. This topic won’t be going away soon, by the way, as the energetic Sun is encouraging you to pursue your dreams. Duty calls, however, and you don’t want to neglect quality time with people or self-care. The good news is that Mercury retrograde in your sign will help you come up with a solution.

"
10102,23 december 2016,capricorn,"The urge to expand your contact list could increase today as assertive Mars suggests rubbing elbows with new people. With a new moon occurring in your sign on the 29th, you’ll be the belle or the beau of the ball, so make plans to get out there, not only on New Year’s Eve but the weeks and months ahead.

"
10103,24 december 2016,capricorn,"It’s time to let go, Capricorn. A cathartic aspect between Saturn and Uranus is designed to help you finally release pain and a sense of unease. Contentment can be yours, but you’re going to have to let it in. The next week brings one amazing aspect after another for becoming a more centered, peaceful individual.

"
10104,25 december 2016,capricorn,"You’re starting to feel  more settled and secure on an emotional level. A highly cathartic set of aspects today bodes well for releasing the past and ignoring the crappy part of the present! This Thursday’s new moon falls in your sign, Capricorn, so “out with the old and in with the new” can start right now. Don’t wait another day.

"
10105,26 december 2016,capricorn,"You seem to have a lot of balls in the air and worry about dropping some of them. How can you maintain a schedule that leaves time for family, a lover and your own personal interests? It ain’t easy, but with the Sun and Mercury in your sign, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to reflect upon this topic. Do it now before the new year starts. This week’s new moon in Capricorn is the perfect time to launch new endeavors; maybe you need to pare your list.

"
10106,27 december 2016,capricorn,"Put as much time as you can into your passion projects as Mars is stoking your brain to come up with some pretty smart ideas. The rest of the world may be in holiday mode, but you need to strike while the iron is hot. Start promoting yourself while you’re at it.

"
10107,28 december 2016,capricorn,"Buddha said, “What we think, we become” and truer words were never spoken for you, Capricorn. With the Sun and intelligent Mercury in your sign, inspiring your thoughts, positive actions can follow. Motivator Mars is in your house of expression, taking your thoughts and turning them into deeds. Make sure that your thoughts take you to a place where you want to go. There’s no pint in wallowing in the muck and mire.

"
10108,29 december 2016,capricorn,"It’s time to start pleasing yourself instead of everyone around you. Today’s new moon in Capricorn is your birthday present from the cosmos to use as you see fit. Think of it as a gift card that can be applied toward any dream or passion of your choosing. Does that mean that goodies are just going to be dumped in your lap? Heck no. You’ll have to work for them, but with energetic Mars in your house of self expression, it’s time to get your ideas out there.

"
10109,30 december 2016,capricorn,"The new year has already begun for you, Capricorn, thanks to the new moon in your sign yesterday. With inspirational Neptune so active in your chart between now and next week, have some fun and really let your brain dream up some exciting new scenarios that you’d like to see unfold in 2017. Neptune can take people to a delusional place, but not you, not now. You know exactly what you want and how to get there.

"
10110,31 december 2016,capricorn,"Get ready to ring out a year that required a lot of hard work and not enough time for play, Capricorn! One of your 2017 resolutions should be to take more down time for yourself. With energetic Mars currently in the most social part of your chart, you can get rolling with that enjoyable goal right away! Mars will be in this spot for most of the month of January so make the most of it.

"
10111,1 january 2017,aquarius,"You’ll be looking for guarantees as 2017 begins, needing to know exactly what lies ahead as January begins today. Shaky job situations, uncertainty in romance and other issues with big question marks around them just won’t work for you! But the reality is that if you want more security in the present and confidence about the future, that you’ll have to make it happen. Start drawing up those resolutions today.

"
10112,2 january 2017,aquarius,"This is no time to wait for job offers and boatloads of cash to just show up magically at your door, Aquarius! Forget winning lotto numbers and raffle tickets too. The cosmos is telling you to make things happen with your finances, and you need to be vocal about it. Ask for the job, the raise, the order, the deal, or the opportunity. You don’t ask, you don’t get.

"
10113,3 january 2017,aquarius,"It’s time to dispel any fears or concerns you have about romantic matters. This isn’t to suggest that life is rosy and that everything is perfect. But with so many planets in your house of security, you need answers, and the only way you’re going to get them is to ask. If your partner isn’t willing to communicate then you may decide to find someone who will. And singles, your days of hanging out with bad boys and divas seem to be coming to an end. A far more practical mood is starting to set in.

"
10114,4 january 2017,aquarius,"Group efforts should start to pick up steam in the week ahead, culminating in a full moon on the 12th. So in order for teams to work together effectively—whether it’s your wedding party or a departmental effort at the office—everyone needs to know their role and just as important, the budget! Mercury retrogrades today back into your house of networking, so if anyone is slacking or unsure about what to do next, they need some direction.

"
10115,5 january 2017,aquarius,"Loose lips sink ships and you need to make sure that the good ship Aquarius  doesn’t go down like the Titanic today. With the Sun and Pluto churning up the waters of your subconscious mind between now and the weekend, fears and negative emotions may be swirling in your mind. And while this is actually a helpful situation as it will eventually enable you to release toxic patterns (and people), a very emotional Moon-Uranus aspect could cause you to blurt something out that you might regret later. This is a recurring theme, and you also need to keep your lips zipped on the 10th, 11th and 31st. Start going within to find peace—and answers.

"
10116,6 january 2017,aquarius,"This is good time to make plans with friends and solidify any activities going on with other groups, such as a volunteer effort, the PTO, your church, an industry group or a family party. You’ll be able to make even more progress next week. Your eleventh house of camaraderie is being activated, which makes for some good times. And you also might be interested to know that this sector governs your fondest hopes and wishes, so get as clear about them as you can.

"
10117,7 january 2017,aquarius,"Pluto is the planet of metamorphosis, the orb that seeks out weaknesses and problems so that they can be addressed and eliminated. Today is one of the most transformative days of 2017 as Pluto meets up with the Sun, which will shine its light on what you need to work on. They meet up in the house of the subconscious mind, so this is all about doing inner work, Aquarius. What toxic ties or circumstances need to be cut? Are there bad habits that are holding you back, such as substance abuse or a constant flow of negative thoughts in your head? While it’s never easy to prune the dead wood from our minds, here’s a piece of good news; Mercury goes direct tomorrow in your sector of big dreams and wishes. So take out the “trash” in order to bring in the good stuff of life.

"
10118,8 january 2017,aquarius,"The cosmos is getting ready to help you move forward with matters at the workplace, as Thursday’s full moon should put an end to delays and infighting at the office. Fortunately Mercury resumes direct motion today in your house of teamwork and technology, so a great way to get the momentum building is to update computer systems and reevaluate the roles people play in a group effort. On a personal level some of your deepest wishes may also start to manifest, perhaps slowly, but any progress is good progress!

"
10119,9 january 2017,aquarius,"When things go wrong and relationships fall apart in Hollywood, “creative differences” are usually cited as the cause. And that’s what you may be dealing with today at the office or in a romance: differences of opinion about the path a certain project or relationship is taking. While this doesn’t spell doom and gloom for your alliances, it does  mean that your patience will be tested over the next few days, especially at the time of Thursday’s full moon. Make sure that you’re not doing all of the “heavy lifting” in a partnership or group effort.

"
10120,10 january 2017,aquarius,"You’re such a gregarious sign that you don’t expect others to be sullen and moody, but that’s what you might be dealing with over the next few days. Don’t let anyone rain on your parade, Aquarius! The problem is that with the Sun in one of the most sensitive parts of your chart, you could easily take offense. Let this pass and hang with the people who have your back.

"
10121,11 january 2017,aquarius,"Practicality rules with a sturdy Mars-Pluto aspect that will help bring more security into your life. The key to working with the energy of the cosmos these days is to keep things real: budget, strategize, assign responsibilities to others, and develop good habits for yourself. The rose colored glasses need to go, and realistic timelines need to be applied to your endeavors. Do that and you’ll be looking at success over the next six months.

"
10122,12 january 2017,aquarius,"Yowza! That little brain of yours is firing on all cylinders, Aquarius. With the full moon in your house of efficiency and getting things done, and Mercury entering your intuition sector, both the right and left sides of your noggin are cooking. Add Jupiter into the mix, which is coaxing you into considering grand visions and plans, and the stage is set for Too. Much. Thinking. But I suppose this is better than having no ideas whatsoever about where you’re headed! Just try to take it slow and deal with one idea or project at a time. When the new moon occurs in your sign in two weeks, you’ll be in a much better place to clarify your agenda.

"
10123,13 january 2017,aquarius,"With so much planetary activity taking place in practical houses, no one would blame you for wanting to unplug. And considering that the Moon is now in luxury-loving Leo, this weekend is the perfect time for treating yourself to some goodies: a night out on the town, a massage, a mani-pedi or a sparkling bottle of champagne. The work will still be there on Monday–forget about it for now.

"
10124,14 january 2017,aquarius,"Your birthday season is approaching, Aquarius, and it’s time to start cleaning house—figuratively, that is. Intelligent Mercury just entered your house of closure, encouraging you to cut ties with people and situations that have reached their sell-by date. You may have discovered recently that not everyone shares the same opinions as you, nor do they seem to be on the same path. If that’s the case you may have some decisions to make, as a secure future is becoming increasingly important to you.

"
10125,15 january 2017,aquarius,"You’re searching for direction or answers, but they may not come easily today, or tomorrow either for that matter. Is it any surprise that you want to know the scoop? Your birthday season kicks off this Thursday and it would be helpful to have a road map for the next year. That’s OK. Sit tight and wait til Wednesday when clarity starts to return.

"
10126,16 january 2017,aquarius,"We all need to do inner work and today a happy Moon-Pluto aspect will enable you to do just that. Consider which parts of your psyche need healing, then determine to take care of them. Whether you meditate, talk to a therapist or take a long walk in the woods, find a modality that works. With the Sun entering your sign on Thursday any old baggage that’s been weighing you down needs to be kicked to the curb.

"
10127,17 january 2017,aquarius,"It’s time to examine your attitude about earning money and saving it, as the planets are focusing a lot of energy on this part of your chart. With Mars in your house of self-esteem you’re probably very motivated to increase your net worth, but first you need to be honest with yourself. Emotional spending and running up too much credit card debt has to go.

"
10128,18 january 2017,aquarius,"Scale back? No doubt you’re ready to see progress, thanks to megawatt Mars blasting through your house of income and self-esteem. But you may be trying to do too much in too little time, or planning grandiose schemes without the good habits to make them happen. Today is excellent for analyzing your methods and projections. You may need to do less in order to achieve more.

"
10129,19 january 2017,aquarius,"Happy birthday, Aquarius! The Sun enters your sign today, showering you with cosmic attention for the next four weeks. But despite the celebratory mood, you seem to be unsure about what’s going on with the people around you: friends, colleagues at the office, or groups that you’re a member of. There is some static among these folks, and the question is—do you want to be a part of it? Sometimes it’s better to stand back and go solo, something that may sound a bit odd with your birthday season under way. It’s OK though, because once energetic Mars enters Aries on the 28th, you can swing back into the social scene.

"
10130,20 january 2017,aquarius,"Woo-hoo! It’s your time in the Sun, Aquarius. If you’re trying to figure out which dream to go after first, why not consider your career and earning more? Red hot Mars is now in this part of your chart for the first time in two years. It will only be there till the 28th, so the next eight days are super for job hunts, asking for a raise or boosting your company’s revenues.

"
10131,21 january 2017,aquarius,"Are you getting paid what you’re worth, or are you settling for crumbs? The desire to earn more—and  to be recognized in your field—could hit you hard today as the passionate Moon stokes this part of your chart. It forms a cleansing trine with Chiron, telling you to release any feelings of worthlessness. The new moon in your sign on the 27th is a confidence builder: don’t hold back.

"
10132,22 january 2017,aquarius,"Aquarians are known as the most social of all the signs, and now that the Sun is in your first house it’s the perfect time to socialize and meet new people. It would also be wise to connect with a mentor, coach or savvy expert who can help guide you. A series of eclipses begins this year in Aquarius, meaning that there are BIG changes ahead. Make sure you’re ready for them.

"
10133,23 january 2017,aquarius,"If a group project is going off the rails, you may need to be the person who will speak up and set things straight. The presence of unreliable Neptune indicates that others may be unwilling to so their share of the work, or fail to stick to a budget. Neither is acceptable. But you’re best off pulling some strings behind the scenes rather than confronting someone about their flaky attitude.

"
10134,24 january 2017,aquarius,"Inspiration flows like wine today thanks to a heady meet up of dreamy Neptune and intelligent Mercury. The best part about this aspect is that you won’t be in airy-fairy land, conjuring up crazy ass fantasies that will never work! Nope, there’s an air of practicality involved in this meeting, so be prepared to think creatively and to act rationally.

"
10135,25 january 2017,aquarius,"There’s a time to hustle and a time to slow down and the cosmos urges you to take a break—at least for a day or two! This includes shutting off the “monkey mind” in which thoughts are constantly hopping around in your poor brain like a crazed chimpanzee. The ability to still your conscious mind will be an important attribute in the week ahead. Mindfulness training, anyone?

"
10136,26 january 2017,aquarius,"The new moon in Aquarius is on its way, which is like your annual New Year’s Eve event. But before it arrives tomorrow the cosmos asks that you temper some of your big ideas with practicality. Generous Jupiter is in your high-flying ninth house of being bold and optimistic. Venus is in the house that deals with realistic plans, such as budgets and time management. These two are having a conversation today about the way in which you’ll go after your passion projects, and from the way it looks, you’ll have just the right amount of logic and enthusiasm.

"
10137,27 january 2017,aquarius,"Yee-ha!! The Aquarian new moon sparkles in the heavens, putting your needs and desires front and center. However, there’s an odd mix of aspects that deals with how much you should be sharing with others. Mercury and Pluto are encouraging you to work behind the scenes on new endeavors, whether it’s a diet, book proposal or career decision. On the other hand, Saturn and Jupiter suggest finding a mentor or friend who can provide you with advice and guidance. How to finesse this? Be circumspect about what you share and with whom. Create a small master mind group to rely on.

"
10138,28 january 2017,aquarius,"Aquarius, you are no shrinking violet. Yesterday’s new moon in your sign opened up a six-month period of focusing on your desires and plans. And today, megawatt Mars enters your ever-so-vocal third house of self-expression. The time is ripe for meeting people, discussing your ideas, planning the next steps to take, taking a class, flirting and dating, and working on the marketing/social media part of a business plan. Stand up for yourself and expand your contact list.

"
10139,29 january 2017,aquarius,"Friday’s new moon fell in Aquarius, highlighting your self-image and kicking off an important six-month cycle in which you can go after just about any ambition. But today subterranean Pluto and intelligent Mercury are holding a meeting, suggesting that before your plunge into new activities that you do a little quiet thinking first. Are you holding yourself back with fear, grudges or past traumas? Do you have any bad habits that need to be addressed before you move ahead? Is your physical health up to par? Take an assessment and make the necessary changes, then dig in.

"
10140,30 january 2017,aquarius,"Stop worrying about what other people think and let your own wisdom be your guide. With intelligent Mercury in your house of intuition you should have no trouble with that, providing you slow down long enough to hear that small still voice from within. It’s a powerful day to pick up inspirational and creative ideas too.

"
10141,31 january 2017,aquarius,"Mixed signals fill the air waves, Aquarius! No, Mercury isn’t retrograde but he’s in a tussle with erratic Uranus. This is not a good day for making big decisions as your intuition and logical mind are at war with each other. Furthermore, you can’t necessarily trust the advice of other people. Wait a few days before making your next move.

"
10142,1 february 2017,aquarius,"Ouch! The pen is mightier than the sword and your words might cut like a knife today, Aquarius. Be careful what you say and to whom, as a difficult Moon-Jupiter aspect could push your emotional buttons, making you say (or text) words that you’ll regret later. Wait till Friday if you need to vent. Gentle Venus glides into your communication sector, softening your tone.

"
10143,2 february 2017,aquarius,"Pay attention to that small voice inside that’s telling you to take a chance on something. With Mars in your comfort driven house of domesticity you could be digging in your heels, thinking that you need to stay put–in a particular job, relationship, town or family responsibility. Not so! You don’t have to chuck it all but you can take a few calculated risks.

"
10144,3 february 2017,aquarius,"A far more social period opens up in your life today thanks to Venus entering your third house of socializing. But while you’re brunching and enjoying cocktails, slow down a bit as the cosmos indicates that you’re trying to do too much in too little time. The next month is perfect for taking three-day weekends and getting out of town to a nearby destination, so plan a mini vacay now!

"
10145,4 february 2017,aquarius,"With so many planets focusing on the next big steps of your birthday year, it may be hard to pin down where to start. Today the emotional Moon shines its light on your home environment. Are you happy with where you live? Are you surrounded by beauty and comfort? Does everyone under your roof get along, not to mention your extended family? If not it’s time to make some changes. When Mercury enters Aquarius on Tuesday you’re going to become a lot more vocal about what you need.

"
10146,5 february 2017,aquarius,"Don’t kid yourself about your finances, Aquarius. A difficult Moon-Neptune square indicates that you may be tempted to spend on unnecessary items. Jupiter is scheduled to retrograde tomorrow in your house of big thinking, demanding a more practical approach to all of your major plans. Many of the goodies we want in life have a price tag attached—make sure that you’re saving up to cover them.

"
10147,6 february 2017,aquarius,"Yes, you’re the celestial favorite right now and yes, it’s your birthday season. The Sun in Aquarius may be making you feel like a kid in a candy shop as you consider all of the possibilities ahead. The problem is that abundant Jupiter slows down in your house of expansion for the next four months. This doesn’t mean that you can’t have any fun or that you’ll be denied opportunities, but it does mean that you have to be realistic with timetables. You might also have to create a short list of what activities you’re going to take on first and get to the rest over the summer.

"
10148,7 february 2017,aquarius,"Your birthday season picks up more steam today, Aquarius, thanks to energetic Mercury entering your sign! Chances are you’re going to be more assertive and start to feel like yourself again. It’s a great time to revamp your image, too, whether it’s your appearance or a change in attitude. In August a series of eclipses are going to start in your sign; your life will change in ways that you may not even be able to imagine right now.

"
10149,8 february 2017,aquarius,"Sometimes the best thing to say is nothing, especially if you’re surrounded by people who defend their bad behavior (slacking, whining, diva tantrums) with indefensible logic. The problem, Aquarius, is that you have several planets in highly opinionated, verbal houses. But today there are too many tense aspects in the heavens that advise against expressing yourself. Wait until tomorrow when a silky Venus-Mercury aspect allows for better communication.

"
10150,9 february 2017,aquarius,"Go tell it from the mountain! Spontaneous Uranus is in your verbal sector, and it could prompt you to be loud and proud today. And so what? Your opinion should  be heard. You’re an Aquarius and the Sun is in your house of self. The end.

"
10151,10 february 2017,aquarius,"Put a ring on it! Tonight’s eclipse in Leo is designed to take a romantic relationship to the next level—or not. Eclipses are game changers, bringing about fast change. As this is a lunar eclipse it will shine its light on a close relationship, essentially making this a big decision moment. Many Aquarians will get engaged, move in together or make future plans that solidify their union. Is it possible that you could part ways? Maybe, if things haven’t been going well. But it’s not likely as this lunation is surrounded by a bevy of helpful planets. Exciting new business collaborations could also be on the horizon, and they could end up being grand in scale.

"
10152,11 february 2017,aquarius,"While the recent lunar eclipse may find you questioning your role in a partnership, today’s happy Sun-Jupiter aspect is going to fire up your optimism, sense of spontaneity and enterprising spirit. Over the next eight months you’ll be a heck of a lot more interested in following your own path, one that’s more rewarding than those you’ve trod in the past. Who will travel with you on your journey? That’s for you to decide.

"
10153,12 february 2017,aquarius,"Avoid making major financial decisions as this week begins as a confusing Moon-Neptune aspect indicates that you may not have all of the facts. Worse, someone may be concealing them. There’s no need to go Rambo on anyone whom you think may be playing games. Just wait until Thursday when a smart Sun-Saturn angle shines its light on the situation.

"
10154,13 february 2017,aquarius,"How much passion do you have toward life? Are you just going through the motions or do you look forward to what the day has in store? Today a helpful Moon-Sun aspect lets you get in touch with your emotions and passion. Get ready to take a chance because the energy tomorrow is all about going after your dreams.

"
10155,14 february 2017,aquarius,"With both the Sun and magnetic Mercury in your sign, your charisma factor is pretty darn high this Valentine’s Day! Better yet is that stable Saturn is in a terrific angle, helping you focus on your deepest desires. Singles should hit the social scene tonight with Mars and Venus both in your convivial house of networking, and coupled up Aquarians should be out on the town too. It’s the perfect time to hold serious talks, by the way.

"
10156,15 february 2017,aquarius,"Slow down there, Aquarius. Mars is turning you into the mother of all social butterflies. Your brain is probably going “snap, crackle, pop” with ideas besides. All of this is lovely, but it may cause you to leap into associations or projects without much thought. Curb your enthusiasm and create a short list of the activities you want to partake in, otherwise you’ll burn yourself out.

"
10157,16 february 2017,aquarius,"It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it. Assertive Mars in your communication sector is putting the right words in your mouth, so stick up for yourself, share your brilliant ideas and network like crazy.

"
10158,17 february 2017,aquarius,"The toughest thing you’ll have to do over the next week is to create a short list of all the adventures and projects you’d like to dive into. Mercury is in your sign, stirring up your imagination and desire to explore new things. But are you afraid that career and other obligations will hold you back? They won’t unless you let them!

"
10159,18 february 2017,aquarius,"Your confidence should start to rise now that the mighty Sun is in your house of increased income. Better yet is the solar eclipse in this part of the sky that will take place on the 26th, the last one in a series that has been designed to take you out of a sparse financial situation. But nothing is going to happen magically on its own—you’ll have to put in some effort. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

"
10160,19 february 2017,aquarius,"Quite impressive! You’re in an excellent spot to dazzle others this week, thanks to eloquent Mercury in your sign. Today and tomorrow the energy is ripe for discussing your biggest dreams and wishes with the people who can help make them happen. Whether it’s a job recruiter, banker, your lover or a trusted friend, share your ideas with other for both making progress and receiving feedback.

"
10161,20 february 2017,aquarius,"Don’t hold back! It’s wise to express your opinion today, even if it throws others off their game. Your goal is not to insult or create drama; the cosmos just wants your voice to be heard. This entire week is excellent for self-expression, except  Wednesday when you really need to keep your lips zipped.

"
10162,21 february 2017,aquarius,"You’re in a pretty expansive mood these days, Aquarius, thanks to lucky Jupiter stirring up your open-hearted, spontaneous house of big possibilities. The problem is that some malcontents in your midst may want to burst your bubble. But your attitude is too upbeat for them to succeed with their Grinch-like maneuvers.

"
10163,22 february 2017,aquarius,"No matter how tempted you may be to speak your mind, the planets warn that discretion must be your #1 goal today. A tense Mars-Pluto standoff indicates that someone in your midst may not have your best interests at heart. The problem is that they may keep their opposition under wraps, so while you’re blabbing away, they’re taking mental notes–and then strategizing how to block you.

"
10164,23 february 2017,aquarius,"Long term connections can be forged today, whether it’s a romantic union or an iron clad business deal. With chatty Mercury in a sweet spot, talk things over with the people who count. It’s also an auspicious time to make new friendships and to join groups of like minded people, such as a volunteer organization. You’re entering into a more mature, stable time period and the company you keep will reflect that.

"
10165,24 february 2017,aquarius,"You have the gift of gab today with a cheeky Moon-Venus aspect, so use it to charm and beguile. This is also a good weekend for some makeover magic as luxe Venus is in your house of self-expression. Consider how to update your look and then get moving. A visit to a spa is a nice way to start!

"
10166,25 february 2017,aquarius,"Believing in yourself is one of the best things you can do to improve your financial situation, Aquarius, and that should be easier now that intelligent Mercury is in your house of income. Put yourself in a position to be noticed by decision makers. You have the talent–showcase it.

"
10167,26 february 2017,aquarius,"One last push? Today’s solar eclipse in your money house is the last one in a series that started a few years ago. If you’ve been hard at work, trying to close deals, switch to a new occupation or land a promotion, then continue to hustle between now and August. Sell yourself and don’t be shy about it.

"
10168,27 february 2017,aquarius,"Truth or dare? You’d better be telling the truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God, with an ornery Mars-Jupiter opposition. This is not a good day to bulls**t your way through a situation, nor is it wise to be way too opinionated. Attention all of you Aquarians who have been bottling up your feelings: they could explode today. Consider yourself warned, and consider the consequences.

"
10169,28 february 2017,aquarius,"Your sign is known for its open friendliness, but sometimes being easy to read can work against you. That’s the case today. While I’m not suggesting that you lie or engage in flattery, you don’t have to tell others everything that you’re thinking or planning to do. Reveal the barest minimum and keep your most important thoughts and ideas to yourself.

"
10170,1 march 2017,aquarius,"Your self-esteem gets a healthy boost today from the cosmos, thanks to a cordial meeting of the Sun and inspirational Neptune. In the days ahead your mind may open to new possibilities, things that will give you a greater sense of enjoying life while remaining proud of your accomplishments. FYI: some of this newfound confidence could come from a higher paying job. Consider your options.

"
10171,2 march 2017,aquarius,"Sshhh! Discretion is the watchword as a tough aspect in the heavens warns against speaking out—no matter how convinced you are that your opinion is just fine, thank you very much. Needless to say, trolling, ranting and gossiping can and will backfire against you. It’s not worth it. Just because you think something doesn’t mean that you should say it.

"
10172,3 march 2017,aquarius,"Security conscious? A number of planetary aspects starting today and continuing over the next week will help you get a handle on your finances as well as your personal relationships. An added benefit is the presence of subterranean Pluto in your house of intuition, which will enable you to see behind facades and agendas. Listen more than you talk and don’t jump to conclusions.

"
10173,4 march 2017,aquarius,"Slow down and think before you speak, Aquarius. No, Mercury isn’t retrograde but Venus is—in your house of communication no less. This could create arguments, sulking and the sense that you’re not being appreciated by others. Your thoughts create your emotions, which then lead to your actions. In order to feel resentful, for example, you first need to think disempowering thoughts that will create the resentment. Be wary of going into this moody place too often between now and April 2nd.

"
10174,5 march 2017,aquarius,"They say that people make the world go ’round, and nothing could be truer for you today, Aquarius. A super Mars-Saturn meet up encourages you to reach out to friends and colleagues, old bosses and folks who would make great mentors. Work that contact list–and have some fun along the way!

"
10175,6 march 2017,aquarius,"They say that “talk is cheap” but not for you this week, Aquarius. This is one of your best times all year to ask for a raise, schedule a job interview or develop a new income stream. A meeting today between intelligent Mercury and the Sun will help you come up with ideas. Don’t wait–run with them over the rest of the week.

"
10176,7 march 2017,aquarius,"If you’re expecting cooperation from others today, Aquarius, you may not get it! People at home or work may be in major slacking mode, so don’t wait for them if you need to make progress. This doesn’t mean, however, that you should let them walk all over you. Tomorrow is a good day to set boundaries, even if they’re personal, confidential ones.

"
10177,8 march 2017,aquarius,"Developing a firmer foundation both in love and your finances is the goal of the cosmos, Aquarius. Today is a good time to reflect upon changes you need to make, habits that could be improved, and thought patterns that might be holding you back from enjoying the comfort you deserve. The full moon on the 12th will put all of this in sharp focus, opening up a six-month chapter in which you can make enormous progress. But you have to be in the right mindset first.

"
10178,9 march 2017,aquarius,"There are three houses that govern your emotions, and all of them are loaded with planetary action—so beware of meltdowns! Mars enters your house of security today, which quite frankly could make you more emo than usual. A full moon is coming next week in your intimacy and libido sector (another mine field), and subterranean Pluto is stirring up your intuition and deepest thoughts. This could end up being the perfect storm or the perfect opportunity to work on your sense of contentment and serenity.

"
10179,10 march 2017,aquarius,"You’ll be feeling like a team player, which is a good thing for your love life, family relations and office environment. Don’t worry, you’re not going to end up being a doormat, With the feisty Sun and intelligent Mercury in your responsibility and routines zone, no one will be able to dump their s*** on you. Just make an effort today to play nice with others.

"
10180,11 march 2017,aquarius,"Pay close attention to facts and figures along with the bigger picture. Optimistic Jupiter is helping you think on grand terms…perhaps a little too grand for your budget these days! With tomorrow’s full moon in your finance sector, building a solid fiscal foundation is the name of the game.

"
10181,12 march 2017,aquarius,"What a perfect day for dreaming! I’m not talking about fantasy-fueled escapist escapades, but a creative visualization session. Think long and hard about the future, Pisces, as a full moon in the sector that governs passion. What is it that you desire in love? Your career? What kind of “toys” do you want to possess, such as luxury real estate or cars? The Sun in your grounded second house will help you come up with concrete plans for making these things a reality.

"
10182,13 march 2017,aquarius,"Speak up! Now that Mercury is in your house of communication you can really get your point across, especially to family members or a lover. With yesterday’s full moon in your house of passion and intimacy, clearing the air with your amour should be first on your agenda.

"
10183,14 march 2017,aquarius,"No one likes surprises when it comes to launching big plans—like your wedding, that European vacation, an online store or presenting your thesis. The cosmos urges you to go over all the details today to make sure that you’ve got everything covered. While you’re at it, assess the players who are involved—is everyone supporting you? Don’t kid yourself. Take an honest assessment.

"
10184,15 march 2017,aquarius,"Things may get tangled up in red tape as the week goes on, but at least you know what needs to be done–and by what deadline! A strong Moon-Saturn aspect helps you define the direction a project or idea should be heading in. Try to get your point across to others, but don’t be surprised if they drag their feet and can’t reach a consensus.

"
10185,16 march 2017,aquarius,"You’ll have no shortage of ideas when it comes to spending money, and fortunately innovative Neptune will help you dream up more ways to earn it. Let the creative machinery of your mind get to work on the earning and savings portion. Once the Sun moves into Aries next week you’ll be able to turn brainstorms into actual strategies.

"
10186,17 march 2017,aquarius,"Your financial picture needs some examining, Aquarius. Your bank account may not be matching your plans for the future. Serious Saturn tells you to either scale back your plans or save more before you continue. Long term plans may also be facing delays, especially if they require the cooperation of other people. Next week is a far better time to make progress.

"
10187,18 march 2017,aquarius,"It’s time to speak up! A powwow between chatty Mercury and Venus sets the stage for getting things out of your brain and into the open. And this weekend is just the opening act. Once the Sun enters Aries on Monday you’ll have four weeks at your disposal in which to lecture, negotiate, learn, teach, write, strategize and socialize.

"
10188,19 march 2017,aquarius,"Who is true blue? Think about the people in your life, be they personal connections or from your job. You’re about to enter a highly social period once the Sun enters Aries tomorrow. Serious Saturn urges you to cull the frenemies, malcontents and divas from your life before you start booking meetings, brunches and get togethers.

"
10189,20 march 2017,aquarius,"Get ready for a busy month ahead, Aquarius–socializing, taking classes, running errands, finishing term papers, blogging, writing, communicating. The Sun has entered your chatty, brainy third house of communication and thinking. This is also an excellent time for negotiating contracts, applying for grants, and taking some quick trips out of town. Three day weekend anyone?

"
10190,21 march 2017,aquarius,"With optimistic Jupiter in your house of taking risks for the first time in over a decade, you are being encouraged to go after some lofty goals. However, fears and negative thoughts like “I’m too old” or “I need security” may be holding you back. In addition, you could be too concerned about what others will think. No one said that you have to completely overhaul your life. Take a few baby steps and see where they take you.

"
10191,22 march 2017,aquarius,"Over the next few days pay closer attention to what your gut tells you rather than what others say. It’s not that they’re trying to deceive you (although one or two of them might); it’s more a situation in which they don’t know what they’re talking about. Getting bombarded with unsolicited and ill-advised opinions won’t help you. Your own intuition will.

"
10192,23 march 2017,aquarius,"Uh, does anyone here know what they’re doing? Confusion may abound—at home, work or anywhere else for that matter—as communications planet Mercury gets gobsmacked by Pluto. Chances are that you’ll be the most reasonable person in the room, thanks to intelligent Mercury in your house of thinking. But others may not be as logical, with some even playing the passive-aggressive game. Saturday is a better day to get through to people

"
10193,24 march 2017,aquarius,"Big ideas and plans may have to be put on pause as you reconsider how to go about them. The good news is that you’re in a highly mental phase right now (think brainiac) due to the presence of the Sun, Venus and Mercury all sequestered in your intelligent third house. Solutions are there if you look for them, so take some time this weekend to ponder.

"
10194,25 march 2017,aquarius,"Show your feelings. Better yet, let people know how much you love them. With magnetic, emotional Venus in a good angle this weekend, sharing your feelings and thoughts is well aspected. Speaking up for yourself at work and in your community is also favored after the new moon on Tuesday.

"
10195,26 march 2017,aquarius,"Can we talk? A spontaneous meeting between chatty Mercury and maverick Uranus could spur a conversation that you may not have been expecting, but good nonetheless. A person you’re dating could admit that they’re in love. A family member may finally try to settle a squabble. You and someone else could hit upon a brilliant idea that could put a lot of cash in your pocket. Whatever discussions being today will continue over the next few weeks.

"
10196,27 march 2017,aquarius,"Confusion regarding a family or romantic matter should clear up this week, thanks to assertive Mars in control of your domestic sector. There may be people in your midst who need to become aware that rules and routines are meant to be followed. Today is a good time to remind them of that, with love of course!

"
10197,28 march 2017,aquarius,"Busy, busy! That’s going to be your MO in the months ahead as today’s new moon kicks off a social yet informative time. The lunation occurs in your third house of networking, errands, social action, nearby travel, education and self-expression. Got a blog, book or screenplay inside that brain of yours? Want to code an app or learn Photoshop? Then get moving, as you can make impressive headway by August.

"
10198,29 march 2017,aquarius,"Network like nobody’s business today, Aquarius! The connections you make can pull strings or help you in ways that you can’t even imagine right now. This includes online dating, which (believe it or not) can be fruitful. Saturn, planet of maturity and long term relationships, is forming a trine—the best angle possible in astrology—to chatty Mercury, so work it.

"
10199,30 march 2017,aquarius,"Slow down, Aquarius! You run the risk of trying to do too much too soon, thanks to optimistic Jupiter pushing you to get past your comfort zone. While you may indeed need to make a break from the past (also known as “getting out of a rut”), it seems that your batteries are a little low. Rest, recharge, then blast forward with confidence.

"
10200,31 march 2017,aquarius,"A social time is opening up for you, thanks to the recent new moon in your chatty third house. And today Mercury buzzes in to your family sector, placing the focus on them. Over the next few weeks you should be spending more quality time with the kids, siblings, a lover, your parents and the neighbors. Business can wait, and to a certain extent so can your friends. It’s also an auspicious time to start some spring cleaning and gardening.

"
10201,1 april 2017,aquarius,"It’s time to stop worrying about other people and to get in touch with your own emotions, Aquarius! Now that Mercury is in your sensitive house of nurturing and feeling secure, you need to indulge in some extreme self care. Pamper yourself, create a home that feels like a spa and spend some quiet time with your thoughts and feelings.

"
10202,2 april 2017,aquarius,"Get your priorities straight about money, Aquarius, as profitable Venus will demand that you focus on this part of your life into mid-April. Next week’s full moon falls in the most expansive part of your chart, encouraging you to take some risks. But before you do, make sure that there is a solid bedrock of cash beneath you.

"
10203,3 april 2017,aquarius,"The planets are inspiring you to become more organized by creating more efficient routines and habits, the kinds that could even put more money in your pocket. However, this may have an effect on your personal life in some way. For example, if you decide to cut back on alcohol, you may see less of your friends. Or you realize that certain connections are holding you back from getting your chores done or getting to bed early enough. Run with what works for you.

"
10204,4 april 2017,aquarius,"You’re more than motivated to get things done but watch that you don’t get too pushy in the process. If you annoy someone whose help you need they won’t hesitate to give you a piece of their mind. With the Sun in your opinionated third house you could come across as being brash or rather impressed with yourself. Slow down and respect others and their time.

"
10205,5 april 2017,aquarius,"You enjoy being in the spotlight, and why not? But for you it’s not all ego and attention. You have something to say that people can benefit from, so don’t hold back. Show the world your talent and ideas.

"
10206,6 april 2017,aquarius,"Team efforts, group activities and friendships may experience slowdowns now that Saturn is retrograde in your eleventh house of networking. It may be time to distance yourself from people or circumstances that don’t share your values or work ethic. This is no time to be a welcome mat, enabler or the good soldier. If others don’t hold up their end of a commitment you may have a decision to make.

"
10207,7 april 2017,aquarius,"Step away from drama today as there may be plenty of people in your midst who want to create it. And you may want to slap on a headphone set too in order to avoid the egotistical rantings of people who think that everyone is entitled to their opinion. Oh, and by the way….you don’t want to be one of those obnoxious people yourself, do you? Stay humble and say little.

"
10208,8 april 2017,aquarius,"What people say and what they mean could be two different things today. This could be in the business area as well as your closest relationships, so pay close attention to subtle cues that will tip you off to someone’s true agenda. Protect your interests and don’t be afraid to say no to anything that sounds “off”.

"
10209,9 april 2017,aquarius,"If you’re smart you’ll use the planetary energy on offer over the next few weeks to take care of housing and family issues. Mercury just went retrograde in this sector, so patch up relations with your parents, get the landlord to fix the plumbing and make your kids clean their rooms. You have such light hearted energy taking place in other parts of your chart that you should be enjoying life without these things hanging over you.

"
10210,10 april 2017,aquarius,"A battle is brewing between your optimistic side and the part of you that’s a bit negative or cautious. It will come to a head with tomorrow’s full moon in your adventurous, big-picture-thinking sector. The cosmos is encouraging you to take a calculated risk, but Pluto is acting up in your worry sector. It’s also possible that someone else may be placing fears in your mind. Follow your own judgment, not someone else’s opinion.

"
10211,11 april 2017,aquarius,"Your ability to see possibilities where others cannot is extraordinary, Aquarius. Tonight’s full moon will help you take a gamble on a new job, relationship, move or adventure that will make your soul sing. But the people who cannot see your vision may balk, throwing up roadblocks or criticism. Be diplomatic but forge ahead nonetheless.

"
10212,12 april 2017,aquarius,"Your self-esteem gets a nice boost from a happy Moon-Neptune connection. From your chart it appears that you may have been a bit down, selling yourself short and not realizing what wonderful qualities you have. That’s about o change, especially after Saturday when Venus resumes direct motion.

"
10213,13 april 2017,aquarius,"Your reputation is a valuable asset, and today’s planetary aspects will help you enrich yours. What you say and do will count for a lot in the weeks ahead, so make sure that your actions and statements are impeccable. The best part is that your own sense of self-worth and dignity will rise along with your reputation.

"
10214,14 april 2017,aquarius,"Tell it like it is, babe. With the sensible Sun meeting up with rebellious Uranus, it’s time to voice your opinion. You may have been hesitant to speak up over recent weeks, but now is the moment to be direct while still being respectful. If other people can’t take what you have to say, that’s their problem–not yours.

"
10215,15 april 2017,aquarius,"Yessss! Profits planet Venus finally goes direct in your income sector, opening doors for making mo’ $$. You’re in quite a visionary place these days too, so now it’s time to take some of your best ideas and run with them. Things won’t take off overnight–not with all of the April retrogrades going on– but the next six months are some of the best ever for getting things started.

"
10216,16 april 2017,aquarius,"Sometimes we need to be reminded about what’s important in life, and today a sweet Venus-Mars aspect does just that. Your relationship with loved ones will become more important in the weeks ahead, so why not start today by spending some quality time with them? Create some new traditions while you celebrate the old ones.

"
10217,17 april 2017,aquarius,"Your words count for a lot today, so be measured in your speech. That’s because long-term-ramification Saturn is involved, indicating that the things you say and do have power and energy that can carry forward for years to come. This is an excellent day to make presentations and network; the more people, the better. You never know where some of these conversations will lead.

"
10218,18 april 2017,aquarius,"Rely on logic today as the Moon may be drumming up fears that aren’t based on reality. If you suspect that someone is trying to get the upper hand or is somehow not being truthful, sit back and give them all the rope they need rather than being confrontational. You may discover that your fears are unfounded.

"
10219,19 april 2017,aquarius,"Feeling secure and content is the order of the day now that the Sun is in your emotional fourth house. This sector governs your family, the place where you live and memories of the past. It’s a good time to do some inner work, releasing the parts of your life that may have hurt you as a child while cherishing the remembrances of the good times. It’s also auspicious for turning your abode into a cozy nest, a place that you love coming home to at night.

"
10220,20 april 2017,aquarius,"You are entering one of the most healing chapters of the year thanks to two planets moving retrograde today. Both Mercury and Pluto start to backstroke in houses that govern mental health and the way in which you express yourself. This is an excellent time for seeking help, whether it’s via a therapist, a bereavement group, meditation or reading up on metaphysics. Not only will you start to feel more optimistic about life, but your creativity will flow.

"
10221,21 april 2017,aquarius,"Honey, when you’ve got it, flaunt it! Lusty Mars sashays into your spicy fifth house of fun, flirting and romance, its first visit here in two years. You’re in a great spot to find new love or jazz up an existing relationship. But there’s a warning attached: Mars can stir up drama and jealousy when it’s here. Furthermore, Pluto just went retro in your moody house of the subconscious mind which can drum up fears and toxic remembrances from the past. The key: don’t rush into new relationships, and avoid making the same kinds of mistakes you’ve made before in love, whether you’re single or already attached.

"
10222,22 april 2017,aquarius,"One of the best ways to ensure that there is stability in any relationship—family, romantic, business, volunteer work—is to determine if you’re on the same page as the other person. A tough Venus-Saturn aspect warns to not kid yourself about this. Get real about shared visions and values, don’t put anyone on a pedestal and don’t tell yourself that things will change one fine day. Next week is excellent for doing some digging on this topic.

"
10223,23 april 2017,aquarius,"If you need to have The Talk—you know, the one that asks where this relationship is going—today’s a good time to do so. Likewise, having a discussion about anything that’s important to the stability of a relationship is well favored. This vibe continues into the week, so don’t feel that you need to get a firm answer today.

"
10224,24 april 2017,aquarius,"Some promising new contacts can be made today, so by all means reach out to people whom you’d like to get to know better. With serious Saturn in the mix, some of the folks you meet could be in your life for decades to come: a potential spouse, a new, tried and true best friend, savvy business colleagues and folks who share the same hobbies and interests. Charitable and volunteer activities are also well favored, so give back to the world and meet some terrific people in the process.

"
10225,25 april 2017,aquarius,"A happy time is about to begin with tomorrow’s new moon in one of the most emotional parts of your chart. This is the house of family and love, but the planets are also encouraging you to make more friends and to get out there and mingle more. Spontaneous Uranus could bring some new introductions your way, so be open minded and ready to let some new people into your world.

"
10226,26 april 2017,aquarius,"Feeling like a social butterfly? You will be, thanks to a bevy of planetary influences all activating the people-centric parts of your chart. But this isn’t just about heading off to cocktail parties and brunches. Sure, you can start booking those dates but leave time for family and loved ones as the new moon occurs in your cozy house of nesting. And don’t forget to set aside some down time for yourself.

"
10227,27 april 2017,aquarius,"Pluto is the planet that plumbs the subterranean depths, and it happens to be retrograde in the house that governs your subconscious mind. This could be a pretty heavy placement but today the dwarf planet is in a helpful mood. It joins up with the emotional Moon to help build a more solid psychological foundation for you. You know best what inner work needs to be done, so don’t delay.

"
10228,28 april 2017,aquarius,"Closeness counts now that Venus is in your highly social third house. Get tighter with your friends, a lover or even your neighbors as magnetic Venus helps you chat, brunch and hold some deep discussions. Spontaneous Uranus is in a good mood, so don’t be surprised if someone calls you out of the blue. Singles could meet a new hottie while out and about.

"
10229,29 april 2017,aquarius,"Be wary of putting someone on a pedestal, Aquarius, or thinking more highly of them than they deserve. The Moon may be fogging up your brain with happy-happy thinking. Keep it real. It’s wonderful to have positive thoughts but if your intuition is off, you could easily be led astray.

"
10230,30 april 2017,aquarius,"Believe it to not, you might actually get motivated to get some grunt work done around the house over the next few days. The Sun is in your domestic sector, a boon for creating a more cozy nest. Start pulling things together at your place as it appears that you have a very social time ahead. You don’t want to waste valuable fun time this summer cleaning out the garage, do you?

"
10231,1 may 2017,aquarius,"A colleague or client could set you off today with a rude remark or diva-like attitude. The same goes for people in the world of “customer service” who have no intention of serving you, the customer, with respect! You don’t like having your time wasted with this nonsense either, but the planets tell you to count to ten. Mercury is retrograde in your communication sector til Wednesday and you might blow your top. Just breathe.

"
10232,2 may 2017,aquarius,"Your love life gets a boost from a happy meeting of the passionate Moon and lusty, affectionate Mars, always a good thing! Mercury has been retrograde in your third house of communication, which could have been creating hurt feelings or drama. Start patching things up today because Mercury resumes direct motion tomorrow.

"
10233,3 may 2017,aquarius,"Say “hallelujah”, say “amen”: Mercury resumes direct motion in your third house of thinking, writing and speaking. Of all the signs you may have been affected the most as this intelligent little planet governs self-expression. Negotiations, discussions, strategizing, socializing—all of these should become easier in the weeks ahead. With next week’s full moon occurring in your career house, now’s the smart time to start shopping your resume or dazzling decision makers.

"
10234,4 may 2017,aquarius,"It’s not always easy to find the right words to say, especially when you’re with someone close. Or, spilling some deep thoughts that have been hidden inside for so long. But it should become easier today as a helpful Moon-Venus aspect helps to let the words and ideas flow. Next Wednesday is another awesome day to speak your piece, so if you’re not ready today then you still have another chance.

"
10235,5 may 2017,aquarius,"Happiness at home may be on your mind these days, thanks to the Sun in your domestic zone. Fortunately an optimistic Sun-Jupiter aspect paves the way for good times and better relationships. A family vacation or reunion may be in the works, so consider some of your options— Disney, a big party this summer or the year end holidays at your place. Singles, reconsider the kind of person you want in your life, as Jupiter is pushing you to take a risk.

"
10236,6 may 2017,aquarius,"You might be filled with a lot of adventurous energy this weekend, but what about the people around you? Chances are you’ll feel like the only one who knows how to have a good time or willing to take some risks. If that’s the case the pursuit of happiness may be a solo endeavor. Either that, or you need to make some new friends.

"
10237,7 may 2017,aquarius,"Life’s too short to sit at home watching TV and the cosmos wants you to get out there and see the world. With a full moon approaching in your success sector, you could end up traveling for business or watching your brand reach people on the other side of the planet. Your earning power is increasing too, so set some cash aside for adventures.

"
10238,8 may 2017,aquarius,"Open mouth, insert foot? Unless you want to end up eating your words you need to be careful today, Aquarius! The emotional Moon may provoke you to speak your opinion, which in and of itself is not a bad thing. But the moon opposes Mercury, indicating that the other person on the receiving end of your comments may not take kindly to them. This energy builds as Wednesday approaches, by the way, so you’ll need to tread warily for the next 72 hours.

"
10239,9 may 2017,aquarius,"Planetary aspects are urging you to heal your tired mind, body and soul, Aquarius, whatever it takes: a nice long vacation, a massage at the spa, a serious discussion with a loved one or cutting yourself off from stressors. The Sun is shining its light on where improvement needs to be made and Pluto is taking a no-nonsense, let’s-get-this-done approach. With tomorrow’s full moon in the most ambitious part of your chart you need to lighten your load before charging ahead.

"
10240,10 may 2017,aquarius,"Your career prospects skyrocket courtesy of tonight’s full moon in the most ambitious part of your chart. If you’ve been trying to land a more prestigious position, a raise or a new gig the cosmos has your back. That goes as well for those of who who may have been laid off and are looking for employment. The key for all Aquarians is to promote yourself like crazy, as Mercury is in a terrific spot to help you. Unpredictable Uranus is active too, indicating that news could come your way—good news—about something you weren’t expecting. By the way, this lunation is fabulous for all of your goals, not just career, so strategize, brainstorm and talk yourself up.

"
10241,11 may 2017,aquarius,"Take your sweet time in matters of the heart, Aquarius. It doesn’t matter if you just started dating someone or you and the SO are talking about having another baby. A difficult Mars-Neptune square creates confusion, which is certainly not helpful when it comes to making key decisions. Your future security is at stake here. Singles, don’t plunge headlong into a romance before knowing more about your new flame. Attached Aquarians need to make sure that there will be guarantees ahead, such as an engagement ring or enough money to pay for the house or baby. Keep it real, as unromantic as that may sound.

"
10242,12 may 2017,aquarius,"What’s the rush? You could be in a big one today, but I’m not talking about racing to work. This is more about trying to overhaul your life in a very short period of time. It’s one thing to be motivated, it’s another to be so driven that you dive headlong into a new situation without giving things the thought they deserve. That said, this is an excellent time to make tracks with a plan. Just make sure that you understand the risks as well as the rewards.

"
10243,13 may 2017,aquarius,"You may need to take more control over a family situation or a group activity, Aquarius. Strong man Pluto is telling you to not get run over by the people around you. There is only so much you should be doing for others; at some point they have to figure things out for themselves. It may be a simple matter of setting some boundaries, as the cosmos wants you to take more time for yourself.

"
10244,14 may 2017,aquarius,"Your opinion certainly counts, but is everyone around you ready to hear it? A tense aspect arriving toward the end of the week warns against being too vocal. So  if you need to get something off your chest, do it today while the cosmos has your back. You may need to soften your approach but at least you’ll have the chance to vent.

"
10245,15 may 2017,aquarius,"Moody much? Pluto’s current position could be stirring up all sorts of emotions, especially those dealing with security. The good news is that once Mercury changes signs on Tuesday you’ll be able to come to grips with the things and people, past and present, that may be making you feel as though you don’t have a strong enough foundation. Keep your thoughts to yourself, though, or share them only with a close confidante.

"
10246,16 may 2017,aquarius,"The ties that bind us to others will be the focus now that perceptive Mercury is in your house of loved ones, nostalgia and comfort. If a family battle has been dragging on now’s the time to end it. The same goes for issues with a lover, kids or an ex with whom you share custody. The good news is that the Sun enters your very  enjoyable fifth house of love, fun, children and creativity this Saturday for a four-week stay. Try to get matters resolved before then if you can.

"
10247,17 may 2017,aquarius,"You’ve got some pretty firm ideas in your head these days, not being influenced easily by others. And that’s a good thing! Today the passionate Moon forms a terrific link with optimistic Jupiter, expanding your mind even further. Will everyone in your world be thrilled with your opinions and plans? Probably not, but that’s their problem. You may get pushback this Friday but don’t let that stop you.

"
10248,18 may 2017,aquarius,"Getting people to reach a consensus today could be almost impossible, courtesy of a Venus-Jupiter opposition in the heavens. There may be lots of chatter that sounds nice and appears to be productive, but is there any meat in there? It’s not that people are trying to deceive you; it’s just that they may be thinking in grandiose terms, doing more dreaming than strategizing. Make sure that you’re not guilty of this yourself!

"
10249,19 may 2017,aquarius,"Your sign is not known for flying solo, usually seeking the camaraderie of others in your personal life as well as business. Which is a good thing as a stellar Saturn-Uranus aspect urges you to join forces with others in the months ahead. If you’re already part of a team effort, some surprising and positive news could arrive. The next six months are also highly auspicious for tech efforts, finding a mentor and online dating.

"
10250,20 may 2017,aquarius,"Ahh, sweet love. The Sun is now in your fifth house of romance, flirting and enjoying the more savory side of life. It’s time for singles to be out shopping for a beau or a belle, while coupled up Aquarians add more spice to their union. However, stern Saturn is warning you from the sidelines to make sure that you share the same values with your amour. This is no time for rose colored glasses thinking. At the same time your friends may be trying to spend more time with you, or butting into your life with unwanted opinions. Keep them in place, talk to your lover about the future and enjoy yourself.

"
10251,21 may 2017,aquarius,"Considering that Thursday’s new moon falls in your house of romance, now’s the time to get ready for a new phase. And with the Moon today in your communication sector it would be wise to air any grievances and discuss long term plans. Singles who are looking for love should be working their contact list and going to as many local events as possible, as online dating isn’t auspicious right now.

"
10252,22 may 2017,aquarius,"If you have something you want to say to someone, this is the day to do so, Aquarius. Lovely Venus sidles up to the Moon, making your words flow like honey. Trust me, this won’t be the case by Thursday as Pluto will be in a mood to strong arm people. Put your legendary charm to work while the skies are still clear!

"
10253,23 may 2017,aquarius,"Lusty Mars is burning a swath through one of the most fun-loving parts of your chart, urging you to cut loose and enjoy life to the fullest. The only problem is that you may become too  flirtatious, social and devil-may-care in your ways. Stern Saturn warns that you might alienate pals or a lover in the process, not to mention losing your focus on your goals. Strike an intelligent balance between play time and work.

"
10254,24 may 2017,aquarius,"Thursday’s new moon falls in your house of romance and having more fun, which should  be something to get excited about. So why are you so grumpy? Could be due to the presence of Pluto, making you more emotional than usual. If you’ve been way too anxious lately about gaining someone’s approval, or demanding guarantees, then you might not be able to enjoy the energy of the upcoming weeks. Put your worries aside, relax and have some fun.

"
10255,25 may 2017,aquarius,"The love train is chugging in to town, thanks to the new moon in the most amorous and frisky part of your chart. You can really enjoy the next six months, provided that you know exactly what you want in love and you’re not afraid to ask for it. Don’t base your ideas about what a happy relationship should look like upon what others are saying or doing. The key is to be true to yourself and to be with someone who respects that.

"
10256,26 may 2017,aquarius,"Some fun activity is brewing in your partnership sector, so get ready. Singles could meet someone new over the weekend, and this won’t be online. Head to parties and barbecues as your best bet for snagging a mate is right in the neighborhood. Couples should plan a spontaneous trip nearby, if possible. Love planet Venus is in your house of “local events” so you won’t have to go to another time zone for romance.

"
10257,27 may 2017,aquarius,"It’s time for you to follow your own inner GPS rather than relying on the advice or opinions of others. The recent new moon should be making you feel like breaking out of a rut or trying a new approach. This shouldn’t be drudgery, either;  doing things for the joy of them is what it’s all about.

"
10258,28 may 2017,aquarius,"Opportunities are going to open up for you in the weeks ahead, and they are the kind that help you develop more security (rather than taking on more risk). With so many planets in your houses of thinking, intuition and creativity you can’t help but succeed. Just stay true to your own vision rather than taking on too much advice from others, no matter how well meaning they may be.

"
10259,29 may 2017,aquarius,"Living for today has its benefits: after all, the mindfulness gurus all talk about focusing on each moment as it passes, not dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. But the cosmos warns that you really do need to get real and start planning ahead more. Flying by the seat of your pants may seem OK right now but it will catch up to you. Consider the consequences of your actions and avoid people and situations that could lead you down the wrong path.

"
10260,30 may 2017,aquarius,"Your ability to network is important today and in the week ahead, so connect with people who are as creative as you are. Together you can come up with some brilliant ideas in both your personal and professional lives. Looking for love, or play dates for your kids, or want to make some new friends? All the more reason to reach out to others.

"
10261,31 may 2017,aquarius,"Getting closer to the people you cherish the most, such as family, gets easier now that chatty Mercury is in a bonding sector. If you need to mend fences or come to grips with old childhood issues (and we all  have them, honey) do so now. The relief that you feel will be palpable.

"
10262,1 june 2017,aquarius,"You’re in an excellent spot to share your ideas with others, so don’t hesitate. This is especially true with group efforts, such as a department meeting at the office, a volunteer effort or your closest confidantes. Exciting new collaborations could be created, and with rational Saturn nearby the success of any endeavor is all but guaranteed.

"
10263,1 june 2016,aquarius,"Love and money don’t always mix, and today you could see evidence of that. A tense angle between the Sun and Neptune could create drama. Perhaps your lover is bent out of shape that you’re earning more than them, or that you’re not making enough! Or your SO wants you to spend cash on items that aren’t necessary: expensive electronics, new kicks for the kids, a pricey vacation to Europe. Work this out while you can, because as the week progresses, things become more incendiary.

"
10264,2 june 2017,aquarius,"There’s a time to hole your cards close to your vest and say as little as possible. Then there are times when it’s in your best interests to open up and let people know what you’re thinking and your plans for the future. The happy Sun and optimistic Jupiter are encouraging you to pursue the latter course. You might be surprised how many people want to travel with you on your journey. As a matter of fact, next week’s full moon is all about networking and joining forces with others.

"
10265,2 june 2016,aquarius,"You may feel moody today Aquarius, but this is not a bad thing. The Moon is stirring up your emotions, specifically your feelings of security, confidence and self-worth. La Luna forms a glorious trine with the North Node, helping you release negative feelings that somehow you “deserve” to be unhappy. Puh-leeze! That’s not the case. Take the toxic trash out to the curb for good.

"
10266,3 june 2017,aquarius,"Can we talk? Hell yeah! Aquarians become quite the motormouths this weekend as charismatic Venus and free-spirited Uranus meet up in your house of witty banter and socializing. You have the cosmos’s permission to go to every cocktail party or barbecue in town. Chat people up, flirt, make some important new connections and meet the neighbors. If your verbosity lends itself to the written word, then start penning that novel or blog.

"
10267,3 june 2016,aquarius,"The Sun and Venus are asking you to take a chance in love, but Saturn is slamming on the brakes. One minute you’re ready to elope, the next minute you’re considering joining a nunnery. Venus fills your head with romantic notions, then Saturn tells you to get real. Even if you’re not this confused (lucky you!) you may find that you’re deep in thought, considering all of the variables of your relationship. Single? You may be questioning whether romance is worth it right now!

"
10268,4 june 2017,aquarius,"Motivation alert! Megawatt Mars is now in your ultra-efficient sixth house of organization and getting things done. It ain’t glamorous, the sixth house, but boy will you feel happier once you’ve completed all of the items on your to-do list. And you will, both at home and at work. This is also the house of fitness and vitality, so the next two months are super for getting back on a diet and exercise regimen. Start eating healthier foods and logging more ZZZZs too……you’ll need the energy!

"
10269,5 june 2017,aquarius,"In 1786 a lovesick Thomas Jefferson penned a twelve page  letter to British artist extraordinaire Maria Cosway, describing the battle going on between his head and his heart as he pined for her. While this may sound juicily romantic, having your head in a twist isn’t always the easiest thing to go through. And right now yours may be in the same place, courtesy of a confusing Sun-Neptune square. Whether you’re mixed up about romance, your career or a family matter, relax. Clarity will arrive at the end of the week.

"
10270,6 june 2017,aquarius,"Your focus will switch to your nearest and dearest thanks to two planets changing signs today: Venus and Mercury. Yes, your career and household chores are calling your name, but they can be pushed to the back burner for awhile. Now that Venus is in your domestic sector, it’s time to spend some quiet time with the people you love…and that includes yourself!

"
10271,7 june 2017,aquarius,"It ain’t easy being sexy and gorgeous, but somebody’s gotta do it, and it might as well be you! Slick little Mercury joins the Sun in your house of fun, flirtation and romance. You can charm the birds from the trees, not only in love but business as well. By the way, hosting Mercury here is superb for heightened creativity and innovation. “Fun” includes hobbies and interests that may have fallen by the wayside. Get back into them.

"
10272,8 june 2017,aquarius,"From your chart it appears that you need to think in a more adventurous way when it comes to your income. No, no, the cosmos isn’t telling you to quit the day job to start the next Microsoft in your basement. But if you feel as though you’re stuck in a financial rut, or you’re worth more than you’re getting paid, it’s time to start doing some research. Tomorrow’s full moon occurs in your house of networking, so reach out to others in your industry or a completely different one. Finding a life coach or a mentor would be a wise move too.

"
10273,9 june 2017,aquarius,"People make the world go ‘round, so they say, and you’d be wise to remember that old adage in the weeks ahead. Tonight’s full moon in your house of camaraderie and networking suggests that you should be mingling with as many people as possible—for finding love, making new business contacts or getting involved in a volunteer project that means a lot to you. With Saturn in a good angle nearby, the connections you make could be in your life for years to come. There’s quite a visionary vibe to this. Be willing to share your ideas and philosophies with others and pay attention to their’s as well.

"
10274,10 june 2017,aquarius,"Business as usual? Hell no! Mighty Jupiter has just gone direct in your freewheeling, risk-taking sector. This is where we grow mentally as we decide to do things differently, maybe even taking a risk. Fortunately wise Saturn is in an auspicious angle, and since this is the planet of logical thinking you should be making decisions that push you beyond previous limits without taking on too much risk.

"
10275,11 june 2017,aquarius,"Get real about your career prospects and financial future, Aquarius. Murky Neptune retrogrades this Friday in your earnings sector for several months. Use this week to wrap up job hunts if you can, and put together a sound budget.

"
10276,12 june 2017,aquarius,"Your ability to find creative solutions that others can’t see will be high today, Aquarius. Better yet is that your personal magnetism will be high, so expect admiring glances from not only your colleagues but potential and existing lovers!

"
10277,13 june 2017,aquarius,"It’s essential that you keep spending in check over the next few months as Neptune is scheduled to go retrograde in your money sector on Friday. Today the watery planet squares off against logical Mercury, which could raise questions about your spending habits when it comes to swag, dinners out and buying things that are nice but not necessary. Also, spending cash on kids (yours or someone else’s) could be in the spotlight. Start being frugal.

"
10278,14 june 2017,aquarius,"Who’s true blue? Figuring out who’s a BFF may be on your mind over the next week. Sometimes the best of friends are the kind of people who stay out of your business and keep their opinions to themselves, unless asked. You may realize that sharing all of the juicy deets of your life isn’t the best way to go.

"
10279,15 june 2017,aquarius,"Not everyone should know your private business, Aquarius, so think twice before you broadcast your latest scoop on Facebook. There is something to be said for maintaining a level of privacy in your life. A Sun-Saturn smackdown today indicates that the juicy tidbits you put out there could come back to haunt you.

"
10280,16 june 2017,aquarius,"Count your pennies—and your hundred dollar bills. Then put them safely away in your bank account, not to be touched for some time. Murky Neptune retrogrades today in your house of income and savings, telling you to be careful about money. Vet new job offers or raises carefully, along with potential clients who appear on the surface to have deep pockets. This may sound austere but it’s better to be safe than sorry.

"
10281,17 june 2017,aquarius,"The planets warn that you need a lot more structure in your life, Aquarius. Whether it’s a morning routine that helps you get out the door easier or a better way of handling the work flow at the office, start making some changes. The new moon on the 24th is all about making progress and decluttering your life. Get a head start this weekend.

"
10282,18 june 2017,aquarius,"Your imagination is on fire this week, so use it to your advantage. There is a creative solution out there for just about any kind of problem you’ve been facing. It’s time to think–and act–out of the box.

"
10283,20 june 2017,aquarius,"Don’t be surprised if someone suggests a spontaneous adventure, something that will take you away from the mundane chores and worries of the day. But you don’t have to wait for the phone to ring—you can also be the one who dreams up some kind of caper and gathers the posse to make it happen.

"
10284,21 june 2017,aquarius,"Like a hot knife through butter! That’s going to be Aquarians over the next four weeks, blasting though their chores, assignments and exercise regimens at warp speeds. An ultra-motivational aspect occurs today—the entry of the Sun and  Mercury into your sixth house of getting things done. A new moon occurs here on the weekend, so get some rest. You’re going to be on a roll.

"
10285,22 june 2017,aquarius,"Put on the rubber gloves and grab the broom. You should be motivated to start decluttering and organizing both your home and office, thanks to hosting three megawatt planets in your house of efficiency. It ain’t sexy doing this kind of work, but will you ever be happy once everything is in order. Feng shui, baby.

"
10286,23 june 2017,aquarius,"When the going gets tough, the tough get going, as they say. It’s time to roll up your shirtsleeves and start taking care of things that are cluttering your physical space and your mind. Unfinished business is just way too stressful. Knock out the grunt work–you’ll be much happier for it.

"
10287,24 june 2017,aquarius,"You need to get handle on the day-to-day “stuff” of life if you want to feel more serene and less stressed. Lighting a fire under you is today’s new moon in your house of organization and productivity. Between now and late December you can make progress when it comes to streamlining your life. And with luxe Venus in a good angle, you should be aiming to beautify your surroundings while you’re at it.

"
10288,25 june 2017,aquarius,"Practicality is the name of the game these days, courtesy of a bevy of planets crowded into your house of efficiency. Lucky for you, inspirational Neptune suggests that the more organized you become the easier it will be for you to earn more. The key, however, is to think big but plan small. Take bite-sized chunks out of your plans, otherwise overwhelm will quickly set in.

"
10289,26 june 2017,aquarius,"Details, details. Sometimes nitpicking is a problem, but this week it’s your best MO. Carefully go over all of the “moving parts” of a project before pushing ahead. Overly optimistic Jupiter may be encouraging you to throw caution to the wind and go for it, but the smart Aquarian slows their roll and takes out the magnifying glass.

"
10290,27 june 2017,aquarius,"Time to create a short list! You may have more things on your to-do list than a human being could possibly accomplish, and that won’t serve you. Having a lot of unfinished tasks hovering over you is a serenity drainer. Pick a few and work on them until they’re complete, then move on.

"
10291,27 june 2016,aquarius,"Momentum starts to build in your career as energetic Mars goes direct in your house of ambition and success! The red planet has been asleep at the wheel for the past few weeks, but this may have helped you crystallize your goals. Now it’s time to put the pedal to the floor. Mercury, planet of negotiation and intelligence, zips into your house of work assignments, bringing in new clients, assignments and potential job offers. Neptune douses you with the inspiration you need to find new sources of income. It’s all good!

"
10292,28 june 2017,aquarius,"You can’t stop a train! And that’s what you’re going to be, Aquarius–a locomotive barreling forward at 90 miles per hour. High energy Mars meets up with faster than lightning Mercury in your house of efficiency, turning you into a powerhouse.

"
10293,28 june 2016,aquarius,"“We have no secrets…we tell each other most everything”, sang Carly Simon years ago. And the planets today are telling you to be open with a partner, be they a lover or business alliance. Let’s face it, there are times when discretion is the greater part of valor, but now is not one of them. The planets sat that it’s wise to let your partner what you’re really all  about.

"
10294,29 june 2017,aquarius,"You would be wise to keep your opinions and bright ideas to yourself today, as it seems that a person around you has a hidden agenda. Your brain should be bubbling over with smart plans and more efficient strategies: don’t let someone else block them, or worse—steal them and then present them as their own.

"
10295,29 june 2016,aquarius,"Sometimes words come flying out of our mouths in a most unexpected manner, and this is not necessarily a positive thing! The same goes for a good rant online, or a strongly worded e-mail. But today’s planetary aspects indicate that letting your thoughts be known is advisable. You may catch some people off guard with your candor, and you might release some deeply held convictions, but so be it.

"
10296,30 june 2017,aquarius,"The eye of the hurricane. That’s where you’ll be today, thanks to a happy Moon-Jupiter connection. Whereas other people around you may be fussing and fighting, steer clear of their petty dramas and go within. Optimistic Jupiter is putting you in a place where you can see the big picture.

"
10297,30 june 2016,aquarius,"Psychologists say that we all have a “shadow side”, and today you may catch a glimpse of one in someone close to you. Truth is it may be a bit unsettling, due to a difficult Venus-Pluto opposition in the heavens. Be wary especially if money or contracts are involved, as well as job interviews, as making an important life decision under these aspects can be dicey. Otherwise, keep your wits about you and your radar on.

"
10298,1 july 2017,aquarius,"Big dreams often cost money, and a practical Moon-Neptune aspect today will help you figure out how to finance your plans. You may need to revise your ideas or trim the fat, something that will become easier to do once the full moon arrives on the 8th.

"
10299,1 july 2016,aquarius,"Healing can occur in so many ways, from the physical, to recovering from grief, to letting go of stress. A magnificent angle today between beneficial Jupiter and magnetic Venus can bring you the healing you need. If you are faced with a physical ailment, ache or pain, sometimes you have to get into the right mindset before the doctor or physical therapist can do their job. Let go and let the curing and repair begin.

"
10300,2 july 2017,aquarius,"Not everyone deserves the inside scoop, Aquarius, so be careful with whom you entrust valuable information. A harsh Mars-Pluto aspect today warns you to keep things on the downlow. With a full moon coming next weekend in the confidentiality sector, this is going to be your MO for the next few weeks.

"
10301,2 july 2016,aquarius,"Planetary influences suggest that it’s time to get your priorities in order, and you may need to get some grunt work out of the way first. Let’s face it, we’d all love to spend time socializing and vacationing, but sometimes you just need to get the oil changed in your car and get your teeth cleaned at the dentist. Take care of the little stuff so that you can enjoy the big stuff.

"
10302,3 july 2017,aquarius,"It may be a holiday weekend in the US but your mind is firmly on big plans for the future. The moon is stirring up your passion to go after your heart’s desire, Neptune is providing inspiration and the Sun is in a practical, “let’s do this” kind of a mood. What are you waiting for?

"
10303,3 july 2016,aquarius,"Routines exist for a reason–they help us streamline our lives so that we can have more free time and less stress. A Sun-Neptune connection today encourages you to examine your habits and routines so that you can sail forward with ease.

"
10304,4 july 2017,aquarius,"Well, ain’t you somethin’. Today sexy Venus enters your house of fun, flirting and romance. Then on Wednesday vivacious Mercury zips into your commitment sector, the place where love and sex gets more serious. And on Saturday a full moon occurs in the house of seclusion….as in,”get a room”. Or seclusion as in “If you don’t want me, I’ll find someone else who will.” What can I say, Aquarius? It’s a win-win for you.

"
10305,4 july 2016,aquarius,"Ready to get your life in order? The new moon in Cancer today falls in your house of efficiency and productivity. The more you streamline, the more new projects you can handle, both at work and at home. Logical Saturn is in an excellent angle from the sector that governs your biggest hopes and dreams, which means that you’re going to be shown a practical way to make things happen.

"
10306,5 july 2017,aquarius,"Sometimes all that’s required to have more goodies fall into your lap is to be more open to receiving things. No, I’m not telling you to read The Secret.  There is a highly practical vibe going on that says if you want more, you need to open your mind to the possibility that it could actually happen. A fabulous Jupiter-Neptune aspect will help you start considering your options.

"
10307,5 july 2016,aquarius,"It’s a great day for money talks, as chatty Mercury forms a trine, the best angle possible, with inspirational Neptune. This isn’t necessarily just about finding a new job, but also about making progress where you are now.

10308,6 july 2017,aquarius,"Your friendliness and generosity are legendary, Aquarius, but sometimes you need to hold back. From your chart it appears that someone may be trying to take advantage of your abundant attitude. You don’t owe them anything, and they also need to learn how to figure things out for themselves.

"
10309,6 july 2016,aquarius,"Your ability to get things done, quickly and effectively, is highlighted with a marvelous Venus-Mars meet up. Monday’s new moon fell in your productivity sector, so the next six months are custom-made for pulling both your personal and business lives in order. Today you can make a terrific impression on the boss, a client, an investor, or anyone in a powerful position. Work those connections, but keep your strategies and discussions under wraps, as tomorrow’s energy is a bit funky.

"
10310,7 july 2017,aquarius,"If a relationship needs some lightening up, then it looks like you’re the one who’s going to have to do it!  With Venus in your fun-loving, frisky fifth house you’re not going to want to be around gloom and doom types. Try to pull them out of their funk and out the door to an interesting concert, movie or cafe. But if they insist on feeling sorry for themselves, then go out and have a good time without them!

"
10311,7 july 2016,aquarius,"Keep your wits about you at the office, as planets in your work sector are acting up. You may get the feeling that things are going on behind the scenes, and it’s possible that there is truth to this. Someone who is acting like a friend could have an agenda of their own. Be observant and reveal little.

"
10312,8 july 2017,aquarius,"If you feel that it’s time to close the door on parts of your life that are simply not worth the trouble any longer, now’s the time to take action. The full moon in your house of healing and moving on will help you assess what (and who) needs to stay or go. A positive Saturn-Uranus aspect suggests that you seek the advice of a mentor or close friend if you’re unsure about some of your decisions.

"
10313,8 july 2016,aquarius,"Time is money, and the more streamlined you become in your daily routine, the more you can earn and save. Over the next six months you’ll be rethinking your regimes, chores and schedules, both at home and at work. Saving money is just one benefit. The other is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your life is in order.

"
10314,9 july 2017,aquarius,"Forgive and forget, or get angry and let it out? That may be the case today as the Moon opposes Mars. If you can wait, Tuesday is a much better time to handle this issue as the Moon will be in your sign.

"
10316,10 july 2017,aquarius,"Just how much sacrificing do you have to do in order to keep other people happy? From your chart it appears that the people around you are expecting a lot. Whether they deserve it to not is another story. If you’re feeling annoyed or resentful, pay attention: it may be time to start letting people handle their own problems.

"
10317,10 july 2016,aquarius,"Sometimes the best thing we can do is to set aside our own personal agenda and cooperate with others, if just for a few days. In doing so, there’s a terrific side benefit–you make a good impression upon people whose opinions count. Planetary influences indicate that you can make a lot of swift progress by letting go of the feeling that you need to protect your own territory.

"
10318,11 july 2017,aquarius,"With the moon in your sign you’ll be more open to taking some chances–and from the looks of your chart, there could be some fun new experiences to be had. You’ve spent enough time lately dealing with other people’s needs (and nonsense)–now it’s your turn to chill out and enjoy life.

"
10319,11 july 2016,aquarius,"A colleague or family member could be a source of drama, as quirky Uranus is sparking them to act out. Whether it’s the silent treatment or a volcanic eruption, you’re not going to be happy.

"
10320,12 july 2017,aquarius,"Just as we have good personal hygiene habits, such as brushing our teeth or washing our hair, so we need smart mental hygiene habits. And with the Moon in the house of creating helpful routines, you should be thinking about ways to “clean up” your inner landscape.

"
10321,12 july 2016,aquarius,"Are you in the mood for love, Aquarius? Now that Venus is in your house of committed relationships, even the most confirmed bachelors and bachelorettes will be thinking of settling down. Mercury glides into this house tomorrow and the Sun on the 22nd. With this planetary trifecta in place, you don’t stand a chance of remaining single—or unhappy in romance! Start considering your options.

The next few weeks are superb for discussing issues with your mate, so get everything out on the table. If you’ve been considering entering into some kind of business alliance, reach out.

"
10328,16 july 2017,aquarius,"Sitting back and letting others run the show isn’t going to work for you today, especially if they have no freaking clue what they’re doing. Which is why you may need to speak up and voice your opinion–even if they haven’t asked for it!

Today these two aspects go up against each other. Wait until the Sun enters leo on Thursday before you make any decisions.

"
10331,17 july 2016,aquarius,"As the Moon enters your vibey twelfth house of intuition, meditation, yoga and closure, you may feel like retreating from the world just a bit.

You’re in a transition period in which old doors will shut and new ones will open. Refresh and energize yourself in anticipation of this.

"
10332,18 july 2017,aquarius,"Teamwork and diplomacy are key, especially if you want to enjoy long term success and happiness with an endeavor. This is true in both your personal and business lives. This is no time to fly solo or try to control others. Be willing to share and communicate!

A fabulous aspect today between romantic Venus and stable Saturn sets your focus on the Real Deal.

A good day to talk things over with a partner is next Wednesday.

"
10344,24 july 2017,aquarius,"Too many chefs spoil the sauce, as they say, and receiving input from everyone you know can be exhausting. By all means, seek the advice of others, but be discerning about where they’re coming from. Pull out the nuggets that work best for you.

10347,25 july 2016,aquarius,"Which can you trust–your emotions or logic? Both will be operating at full tilt, with your intuition throwing in a few statements here and there. The bottom line: don’t make any major decisions today. Consider all of your thoughts, feelings and ideas as valuable input…which you’ll use to figure things out later in the week.

"
10348,26 july 2017,aquarius,"Romance can heat up faster than a house on fire, thanks to a synergistic meeting of the Sun and Mars.

"
10349,26 july 2016,aquarius,"How you handle family matters is the question of the day, Aquarius! Pluto, the great change maker, asks you to take a more intuitive approach in dealing with parents, siblings, kids or roommates. The recent full moon was all about setting boundaries, but sometimes you need to take the back door approach rather than the front door.

"
10350,27 july 2017,aquarius,"You know what you want and you intend to get it! The only issue is that you need the help of others to make things happen. Don’t leave their needs and opinions out of the picture.Cooperate and make faster progress as a result.

"
10351,27 july 2016,aquarius,"The astrological picture suggests that the next few days are excellent for communicating your ideas to others, especially romantic partners or business alliances. If plans need to be made about which direction your partnership is heading in, it’s wise to firm them up before Friday when Uranus goes retrograde. You’ll be able to make progress after then, but there could be disagreements about details.

"
10352,28 july 2017,aquarius,"Your optimism should be rising thanks to a happy Moon-Jupiter meet-up—so why are you feeling reluctant or unsure? Maybe you’re convinced that God/The Universe doesn’t have any goodies in store for you, or that your karma sucks. Nothing could be further from the truth; it’s just your own fears. Chin up!

"
10353,28 july 2016,aquarius,"No doubt you’re feeling quite industrious these days, as get-things-done Mars is ratcheting up your ambition. But the Moon in Taurus opposes Mars today, suggesting that you slow down a bit and take stock. You can’t be on the go all the time. Nesting at home with your family, pets, garden and hobbies is a good way to recharge those batteries of yours, which I’d like to point out are a little drained!

"
10354,29 july 2017,aquarius,"Blurt alert! You could accidentally spill today, and your words could land you in a difficult spot. Avoid the temptation too to let someone have it, even if they have it coming. They might retaliate in a subtle yet powerful way.

"
10355,29 july 2016,aquarius,"Slow down! Uranus has just gone retro in your house of socializing and zipping around the neighborhood. Uranus loves technology, so maybe you’ve gotten used to texting instead of face to face talking, or ordering your groceries online rather than shopping at the store. Instead, why don’t you head to the farmer’s market on weekends and eyeball the delicious produce and homemade breads and jams. Call a pal and spend the afternoon just catching up. Give the electronics a rest and go Luddite. You might be pleasantly surprised–and less stressed.

"
10356,30 july 2017,aquarius,"Today’s a day when you might even surprise yourself, as spontaneous Uranus encourages you to say or do something out of character. But this is a good thing.

"
10361,1 august 2016,aquarius,"Partnering up with others is on the planets’ agenda for you these days, and two terrific trines can make it happen. A surprise offer could come your way from someone who’d like to enter into a business alliance, or ask you to join a team of like-minded people. On the romance front singles could find that a pal is instrumental in introducing them to a new love, and this is a serious contender, not a wannabe.

"
10362,2 august 2017,aquarius,"Who loves ya, baby? Consider the people around you who are of the “tried and true” variety rather than the on-again, off-again flakes. If a certain connection isn’t solid you may decide at the time of next week’s eclipse to cut the cord and move on.

10367,4 august 2016,aquarius,"As the passionate Moon swings past Venus and Mercury in the house of intimacy, you will be reflecting upon the state of your union. Is your current relationship providing you with the freedom to be who you really are, and to go after some of things you’re most passionate about? Singles need to consider this as well before they enter into a new relationship. A romantic alliance shouldn’t feel like a confined space.

"
10368,5 august 2017,aquarius,"Some relationships have too many “rules”; others could use a few more. Take an assessment of your close alliances to determine if any of them need to be altered. Truth be told, with Monday’s lunar eclipse coming in your sign, you’re not in the mood for anyone overstepping their bounds.

"
10369,5 august 2016,aquarius,"Venus, planet of ease and comfort, glides into your house of intimacy today, encouraging you to share your thoughts with the people closest to you. But a strained aspect with Mars suggests that you choose you confidantes wisely. Just because someone is a friend or lover doesn’t mean that they get a free access pass to your mind.

"
10370,6 august 2017,aquarius,"You may feel pulled between playing it safe and living on the edge, and the problem is that your intuition won’t be any help! No problem, however.

But who is going to travel forward with you on this journey? That’s the big question this weekend as a bevy of planets are stirring the pot. Are certain people going to be left behind as new ones come on board? Give it some thought, but don’t make decisions just yet. Wait for Saturn to start moving forward.

"
10375,8 august 2016,aquarius,"Some readjustments are in order when it comes to pursuing your goals, especially when it comes to financing them. With luxury-loving Venus now in your house of debt and financial obligations, you may be tempted to spend money on swag (not to mention sports cars, boats, dream houses), but the planets warn to save some cash for a rainy day. When saturn goes direct this Saturday you’ll be able to develop a logical and secure plan.

"
10376,9 august 2017,aquarius,"If something has been niggling away at you about a close relationship, it’s time to do some digging. You need to know where you stand and what others are thinking. If that means doing a little snooping so be it.

"
10381,11 august 2016,aquarius,"The energy of a group dynamic is the focus of the planets today, as Mars and Saturn in the friendship and teamwork sector stir the pot. Just how much should you say or reveal? No matter how much you might trust your tribe it would be wise to censor what you put out there, verbally or via social media and texts. While it doesn’t seem that there’s a frenemy lurking about, the danger is that your feelings may get hurt if you feel that your point of view isn’t being considered.

"
10382,12 august 2017,aquarius,"Lock up the credit cards, Aquarius! Mercury retrogrades in your debt sector til the 31st, making the next few weeks a bad time to splurge.

"
10383,12 august 2016,aquarius,"The planets are shining their focus on the people in your circle, Aquarius, and you might be entering into quite an active, social time. But “keeping up with the Joneses” is a possibility under today’s influences, as you hear about your friends’ raises, vacations and wedding plans. Your dreams may have seemed out of reach over the past few months, but that’s about to change. Quit comparing your life to other people in your circle–instead, pay attention to your  path ahead.

"
10384,13 august 2017,aquarius,"Collaborations with others can really heat up over the next six months, and your best experiences will be with others by your side. The next 48 hours could bring some new people your way, or suggestions for alliances that are certainly interesting. These  have some serious long term potential, by the way, so get ready to commit.

"

Well, that’s about to change, aquarius, as mighty Saturn moves direct in your eleventh house of teamwork. This house also governs technology, so if you’ve been stuck in techno hell trying to iron out apps, programs or a website launch, expect the computer gremlins to go bye-bye.

"
10386,14 august 2017,aquarius,"Time for some feng shui? Even if you don’t believe in that concept, the cosmos is telling you to declutter your space, both at work and at home. A cluttered desk leads to a cluttered mind. Who needs the stress?

"
10390,16 august 2016,aquarius,"Innovative Uranus is your best friend today, sparking your mind with creative (maybe even genius!) ideas. If so, don’t keep them to yourself. A positive Sun-Uranus trine encourages you to share your brainstorms with people who can help you turn them into something real. There’s a strong profit potential involved with this; make sure that although you’re willing to collaborate, that your interests are protected.

"
10391,17 august 2017,aquarius,"Nitpicking won’t get you far today; as a matter of fact, it may piss people off. It can also create paralysis by analysis with a project or goal of yours. Sometimes you just have to let go and trust that things will work out…which they will.

"
10392,17 august 2016,aquarius,"Ready to move ahead? Tomorrow’s full moon in Aquarius will set the stage for the next six months, so consider what you’d like to achieve between now and your birthday. Today you benefit from an auspicious meeting: Venus and Pluto are discussing what to toss and what to keep. Pluto may require that you start over completely in areas of your life that are over, done; and Venus’ goal is to make the changes ahead come easily for you.

"
10393,18 august 2017,aquarius,"Getting organized becomes a heck of a lot easier when take-it-easy Venus is on your side. The weekend is here, so start digging in to some tasks that you’ve been meaning to get to. Break them into bite-sized chunks so that you don’t become overwhelmed, a real possibility under the current cosmic picture.

"
10394,18 august 2016,aquarius,"“Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you….”  What? It’s August! But that doesn’t mean that the cosmos isn’t delivering goodies your way. Today it does, with a full moon in Aquarius. You may be wrapping up initiatives that started back around the time of your birthday, and now you’re ready for some new ones. Matters of the heart are especially focused on with a Sun-Uranus trine. It’s an excellent time to have a conversation with a lover about where you’re heading.

"
10395,19 august 2016,aquarius,"With Mars in your house of big plans in a tense angle to confusing Neptune in the income sector over the next week, it may be hard to get to grips with a budget or business plan. The key is to slow down and carefully consider your options. In the days ahead you’ll be able to come up with rational, concrete goals that you can afford.

"
10396,20 august 2016,aquarius,"The recent full moon in your sign is helping you make key decisions, Aquarius. Over the next few weeks and months you’ll be culling out what’s important and what needs to go. A Moon-Venus opposition today will shine its light on your closest relationships and just how secure you feel in them. While you’re being encouraged to speak your mind and let others know exactly how you feel, someone may not be as open or willing to talk right now. Don’t push it. The atmosphere improves next week.

"
10397,21 august 2016,aquarius,"Teaming up with others is a big theme in the days and weeks ahead, and today the Moon is in a good position to help you find the right connections. Someone that you may not have expected to be a good fit could actually be just the right person, so keep an open mind.

"
10398,22 august 2016,aquarius,"Money talks, and it certainly will be talking to you over the next few weeks. Today the Sun rolls into your eighth house of finances, joining profitable Jupiter, intelligent Mercury and charismatic Venus. This is one heck of a lineup for analyzing your portfolio and figuring out how to increase your net worth. There may be opportunities coming your way to team up with someone else–for work, a business partnership, or as an investor. Entertain offers but do your homework before you invest your precious time and money.

"
10399,23 august 2016,aquarius,"Joining forces with other people is the name of the game right now, Aquarius, and your friends could be the key to some exciting opportunities in the future. The chance to be part of a team in your industry is also on the table and networking could pay off handsomely in the weeks ahead. One caveat: be careful of investing your hard-earned money in a venture that may come your way, whether it’s a pal’s destination wedding or a relative’s new restaurant. You need to protect your financial portfolio and build it through things that are rock solid.

"
10400,24 august 2016,aquarius,"Be meticulous when choosing the people in your circle, Aquarius. A stern meeting today between Saturn and Mars is designed to help you pick and choose the players you want by your side, from friends to lovers to work colleagues. Your long term plans stand an excellent chance of succeeding, as Saturn is lending its wisdom and Mars its drive. But the wrong partners will not only slow your progress, they can derail it.

"
10401,25 august 2016,aquarius,"Whoever coined the term “FOMO” was on to something. Fear of missing out is an ugly little demon made worse by incessantly tuning in to social media and watching “everyone else” have fun. Watch that this little bugger doesn’t bite you on the butt today, quite possible under current planetary influences. Comparing yourself to others–and spending money you may not have to keep up with them–is only going to making you more unhappy. With an awesome solar eclipse next week in your financial zone, you’ll be looking at more love and cash flow over the next six months.

"
10402,26 august 2016,aquarius,"You may feel a bit like a fish out of water today, due to a Mars-Neptune square that could undermine your sense of self-worth. This may be especially true among friends or people you see on a regular basis, such as team members or people who are in the same volunteer or charity group as you. But it seems that your fears are unfounded, so go easy on yourself. There’s no need to be defensive.

"
10403,27 august 2016,aquarius,"An emotional bonding today between two of the most benevolent planets in our solar system will work wonders for soothing your soul. They meet in your house of spiritual clearing, sexual chemistry and deep emotions. It’s quite a healing vibe, so take the time to be good to yourself.

"
10404,28 august 2016,aquarius,"Lunar activity indicates that you might hit upon a bright idea for earning more, and it seems to come from having to struggle in the past. The old saying about learning from your mistakes is so true today. But with the Moon in a tough angle to blabbermouth Uranus, keep any brainstorms you may have to yourself for now. They could be quite profitable and you need to own that information.

"
10405,29 august 2016,aquarius,"Hold your horses there, pardner. You may be anxious to get ambitious plans off the ground–going back to school, starting a business, traveling to an exotic locale–but Mercury retrogrades in your finance sector tomorrow. Don’t make any major decisions or embark on a new venture without having the monetary details completely vetted, especially if you’re taking out loans or relying on an investor.

"
10406,30 august 2016,aquarius,"The planets are pushing you forward onto a larger stage with a bigger spotlight thanks to Venus entering the most adventurous part of your chart. You could be getting ready to apply to grad school, get engaged, travel around the world or patent an invention. But Mercury retrogrades in your house of finances, indicating that you need to make sure that the money is there before you move forward. A lover may also be on the defensive as you discuss your plans–are they afraid that you’ll fly away?

"
10407,31 august 2016,aquarius,"An independent streak is going to start blazing a path in your mind, and I pity the person who tries to hold you back. It’s not that you’re going to be selfish or thoughtless, but Venus is pushing you to take better care of yourself. And if that means setting boundaries or even cutting ties, so be it.

"
10408,1 september 2016,aquarius,"You’ve got mail! News could be coming your way soon about a joint venture that someone would like to enter into with you, and this could be romantic as well as business-related. Today’s solar eclipse in Virgo can boost your finances as opportunities open up for investing and earning passive income. And your love life could take a sexy, more intimate turn for the better as you become more confident about being vulnerable and strong at the same time.

"
10409,2 september 2016,aquarius,"Emotional much? The good news is that a happy meeting between Jupiter and Mercury will help you make progress when it comes to relating to a loved one or healing outworn, negative feelings. But Neptune may start whispering in your ear, “Don’t rock the boat! There’s nothing wrong with the crummy old past!” Uh, yes….there is. And it’s time to take it to the curb.

"
10410,3 september 2016,aquarius,"Ooh la la! The passionate Moon winks at generous Jupiter in your house of libido, then swings past love planet Venus in the place where we become (ahem) adventurous. 2 + 2=4. This one isn’t hard to figure out. Singles, you’re not left out of this conversation. You could spend some time this weekend with Mr. or Ms. Right Now, or wait for Mr./Ms. Right to show up around the time of the lunar eclipse on the 16th.

"
10411,4 september 2016,aquarius,"Open mouth, insert foot? You may want to keep your opinions to yourself today as the Moon may prompt you to blurt something out that you’ll regret saying. While your opinions and emotions are probably right on target, thanks to the Sun’s position, you could create a destabilizing situation for yourself by venting. Sometimes you just have to be more concerned about your security than rocking the boat, and this is one of these days.

"
10412,5 september 2016,aquarius,"Powerful planetary forces are at work trying to help you earn and save more money, but you seem to be dealing with some negative emotions that are getting in your way. Memories of past financial problems may be bubbling to the surface, or the feeling that you tried something before and it didn’t work. Or perhaps you lack the self-confidence to visualize a more prosperous future. That’s going to change on Friday, when Jupiter’s move into Libra starts filling you with more optimism.

"
10413,6 september 2016,aquarius,"The iron fist in the velvet glove. That describes you today, Aquarius, as the cosmos tells you to take command of a situation–without making a big stink about it! On the contrary, you should seize the reins with a smile on your face and honey dripping from every word. No one’s telling you to lie or be deceitful. It’s just that sometimes true power needs to be cloaked.

"
10414,7 september 2016,aquarius,"Get out the dream catchers, some incense and those beautiful crystals. A powerfully healing aspect between two major orbs, the Sun and Pluto, will help you put things in the right perspective. Catharsis can happen while you’re in the shower or standing on line at the bank, but you can speed things along by creating a little altar at home with objects that help center you. Daily devotion to your inner peace is time well spent.

"
10415,8 september 2016,aquarius,"Your mind will stop focusing on mundane things like getting the grocery shopping done and instead dwell on loftier aims: travel, going back to school, immersing yourself in other cultures and maybe even taking up philosophy. If you’ve never read the book 1000 Places to See before You Die, now’s a good time. No, you’re not dying. But the moon forms a superb angle with Mars and Saturn today, making you realize that there’s more to life than the little world you’ve gotten used to.

"
10416,9 september 2016,aquarius,"Feeling entrepreneurial? Got wanderlust so bad that you’re ready to pack a bag and head to the airport—now?! Ready to take on a course load at a college or skill development academy? Thank generous Jupiter for the sudden surge in ambition and the desire to expand your mind. Today the big planet heads into Libra, where it will stir you over the next year to live a much bigger, more adventurous life.

"
10417,10 september 2016,aquarius,"A tough Saturn-Neptune square urges caution when it comes to money matters, especially when it comes to financing big plans of yours. For example, don’t plan the wedding of the century, operating on the premise that you’ll receive enough money in the form as gifts to cover the cost of the affair. And don’t let friends (or your envy of them) seduce you into spending money just to keep up with their lifestyle. With murky Neptune in your income and security sector, you have to be pragmatic about finances.

"
10418,11 september 2016,aquarius,"Sometimes you just gotta tell it like it is, but beware of being too blunt. Venus in Libra may make you quite opinionated, and while there’s nothing wrong with “speaking your truth” as the saying goes, today’s tense angle with Pluto means that you could be up against some opposition. The problem is that the other person may mask their displeasure. Think before you speak.

"
10419,12 september 2016,aquarius,"Your brain will be buzzing with ideas about how to build a more solid financial foundation, Aquarius! With smart-as-a-whip Mercury linking to the illuminating Sun, you can make progress in paying down debt, going after monies owed to you or lining up some kind of passive income on the side. But remain patient. Mars is burning a path through your house of big dreams and wishes, possibly making you impatient to see more dinero. One step at a time.

"
10420,13 september 2016,aquarius,"With Mercury retrograde in your eighth house of finances, this is an excellent time to get a handle on your portfolio. Figure out ways to pay down debt, start putting away more money for retirement and consider starting a business that will pull in more cash, even if it’s a side gig for now. With Friday’s lunar eclipse in your income sector a “little business” could morph into something much bigger.

"
10421,14 september 2016,aquarius,"Your sign is known for its love of life and the desire to socialize, so today’s celestial aspects are going to be right down your alley. A happy Moon-Uranus-Mars connection is perfect for doing something spontaneous with your tribe. Take advantage of it now, because once the lunar eclipse occurs later this week, your thoughts will turn to more practical matters—like making mo’ money.

"
10422,15 september 2016,aquarius,"You’re entering a major crossroad at which you’ll need to make decisions about money, your occupation, and even your self-worth. Tomorrow’s eclipse in Pisces will bring long-simmering issues and concerns to a boil. But don’t make any major decisions today, as foggy Neptune is meeting up with the  emotional Moon. You run the risk of operating on feelings and not facts.

"
10423,16 september 2016,aquarius,"Your self-esteem is about to get big boost, along with your income! A powerful and productive lunar eclipse today will put an end to past dry spells when it comes to money. As eclipses work quickly, you could suddenly come up with an income-building strategy that will take off. Likewise, a new job offer could come your way in the months ahead. And as you earn more, save more.

"
10424,17 september 2016,aquarius,"Keep your schedule light today, as independent Uranus could spark an impromptu party, brunch, dinner out or a trip to the beach. Don’t be surprised if a pal calls you at the last minute to plan an adventure. You only live once—make sure that you fill your days with some fun here and there!

"
10425,18 september 2016,aquarius,"If there’s one sign of the zodiac that should be feeling like taking a risk and living a more adventurous life, it’s you, Aquarius! And today spontaneous Uranus could spur you into looking into new avenues, whatever that might mean to you. It may hit you all at once that you’re living just a little bit too safe. Get out of that box!

"
10426,19 september 2016,aquarius,"You’re in a good spot in which your knowledge, intuition, and wise input from others can all come together. Run your ideas past a mentor, friend or expert today as a helpful angle between Venus and Mars could ring you the answers or solution that you’re seeking.

"
10427,20 september 2016,aquarius,"If you feel as though you’re going through therapy (even if you’re not meeting with a counselor!) you can thank mental Mercury and cathartic Pluto for your intense thoughts and emotions. The good news is that they form a glorious trine today, enabling you to start tossing out old thoughts and feelings that need to be excised from your psyche. Once Thursday arrives you can move forward with more confidence and ease.

"
10428,22 september 2016,aquarius,"If there’s going to be one sign of the zodiac that is itching to pack a bag and get out of town it’s you, Aquarius! The Sun enters Libra today, your inspirational ninth house of travel and adventure. Considering that it’s joining optimistic Jupiter, you won’t let anything hold you back. And that includes all areas of your life, like love, education, and your career.

"
10429,23 september 2016,aquarius,"With lucky, optimistic Jupiter and the Sun now in the most adventurous part of your chart you should be brimming with big ideas and plans. A small voice, however, may be whispering in your ear, questioning whether you can pull them off. The key is to pay attention to the details. Take care of the small stuff and the big stuff will happen.

"
10430,24 september 2016,aquarius,"A tug of war might erupt in your mind today, a battle between your head and your heart. Romance may be beckoning as Mercury stirs up deep feelings and emotions in a nice way. The Moon, however, is fixated on practical matters. Find a way to balance both and your romance will flourish.

"
10431,25 september 2016,aquarius,"Relationships of all kinds get a boost over the next few days as the Moon shines its light on your closest connections. You have quite an exciting year ahead, courtesy of tomorrow’s Sun-Jupiter conjunction. The message from the stars is to find a nice balance between your personal life and business. Don’t take your job home with you.

"
10432,26 september 2016,aquarius,"One thing’s for certain: by this time next year you’re not going to be the same person you are today. That’s because the Sun and Jupiter are meeting in the most expansive part of your chart, one that affects our minds and personalities in a positive way. You’ll become more open to new experiences, different opinions, philosophy, and foreign cultures. You may travel extensively, broaden your mind through study or become known in the news media and publishing industries. Take a leap of faith.

"
10433,27 september 2016,aquarius,"You’re in a glorious spot for some deep healing, whether it’s for physical maladies or issues that affect your serenity and happiness. Pluto has been retrograde in the house of the subconscious mind, dredging up old traumas and difficult emotions. But now it’s in direct motion, and what’s better still is that ambitious Mars enters this sector today for the first time in two years. Use this positive energy to kick bad habits, cut toxic ties, pamper yourself, relax and rejuvenate.

"
10434,28 september 2016,aquarius,"It’s a perfect day to share your deepest thoughts and emotions with someone close as the emotional Moon and intelligent Mercury trine Pluto. Just make sure, however, that you’re not kidding yourself about which direction a relationship is heading in. You may be looking for security and specific answers whereas someone else isn’t ready to provide them. Talk it over and get to the bottom of the issues.

"
10435,29 september 2016,aquarius,"Ready to vent? The cosmos thinks so! A productive Moon-Uranus aspect may find you letting loose with your words, but this is all for the good. You could blurt out that you love someone, or that you need to have more space. You might finally release some emotions that have been building up for some time now. For future reference, don’t hold it all in!

"
10436,30 september 2016,aquarius,"Thinking about building your brand, growing your presence, or expanding your sales territory? Then today’s the day to work on that as the passionate Moon forms a lucky link with prosperous Jupiter in your house of expansion. Venus and Neptune are working together in the days ahead to show you the money as well as the kudos for hard work you’ve done in the past.

"
10437,1 october 2016,aquarius,"A luscious new moon in your adventurous ninth house occurs, encouraging you to start coloring outside the lines! Problem is, Mars and Pluto in the moody, mysterious twelfth house of the subconscious mind may make you a bit reluctant to put yourself out there and take a risk. Since Pluto governs our “shadow side” you may want to reflect upon the ways that your fears have held you back in the past. That being said, a super Venus-Neptune trine the same day is perfect for going after a higher salary and/or a new gig. Your creativity will be off the charts thanks to Neptune, so use that to your advantage on interviews.

"
10438,2 october 2016,aquarius,"Your eyes may be bigger than your wallet these days, so carefully consider where and how you’ve been spending your money. The good news is that intelligent Mercury is in your house of financial security for another week, so this is a good time to talk to someone, such as an investment advisor, about what to do next. Likewise, you might be considering a job change to bring in more dinero, which is highly favored on Tuesday.

"
10439,3 october 2016,aquarius,"Your intuition is off the charts these days, Aquarius, and it would be a shame not to use this gift from the cosmos to your advantage. A powerful aspect today between Venus and Pluto will help you uncover what may be going on behind the scenes at work. Likewise it could help you sniff out a new position somewhere else–with higher pay and a better chance for upward movement.

"
10440,4 october 2016,aquarius,"You’re known as being one of the friendliest signs of the zodiac, and today a happy Sun-Saturn aspect can bring even more new faces into your life. Saturn is the planet that talks long-term, so new connections could be in your life for years to come. This is also an auspicious aspect for any kind of tech project, such as launching a website, meeting someone through an online dating service or coding an app.

"
10441,5 october 2016,aquarius,"You appear to be working on things that will be in your life for a long time to come, whether you’re planning your wedding, saving money for a house or building your career.

It’s the “perfect storm”…but in a good way!

"
10442,6 october 2016,aquarius,"With ever optimistic Jupiter in your expansive ninth house, you may feel like a kid in a candy shop as you eye all sorts of delicious projects to go after. This is better than remaining in a rut, mind you, but not if you over extend yourself, which is a possibility over the next few days. Don’t let your eyes be bigger than your schedule will allow.

"
10443,7 october 2016,aquarius,"Tie up loose ends. That’s the message from the cosmos as transformative Pluto is active in your house of closure. Whether it’s cleaning out the garage, breaking a bad habit, cutting a toxic tie or finishing your thesis, wrap up the past and present so that you can embrace the future. That’s because Mercury joins the Sun and Jupiter today in your free-spirited ninth house of trying new things. You may end up in complete overwhelm if you don’t finish things you’ve already started.

"
10444,8 october 2016,aquarius,"Somebody sure is psychic this weekend, Aquarius! With the vibey Moon connecting with Mars and Pluto in your intuitive twelfth house, no one around you will be safe with their secrets. You’ll be able to sniff out the truth better than a bloodhound. A little side benefit to this is that Neptune is in a good angle from your earnings sector, making this weekend a great time to sniff out more ways of making money.

"
10445,9 october 2016,aquarius,"How much do you enjoy what you do for a living? If the answer in “not much”, then pay attention to today’s planetary aspects. Sweet Venus is cruising through your career zone, telling you to follow your bliss. And the Moon, Mars and Pluto, all in your house of closure, are recommending that you put an end to any  situation that doesn’t help you grow. Just be careful to not verbalize your discontent–or your more exciting new plans–to the wrong person.

"
10446,10 october 2016,aquarius,"With the Moon in your house, it’s all about you today! Consider what passion projects you’d like to dive into. Tomorrow’s special Mercury-Jupiter conjunction is all about trying new things, expanding past boundaries and taking some educated risks.

"
10447,11 october 2016,aquarius,"It’a a corny old saying, but here goes: “Minds are like parachutes. They function best when they’re open.” Truer words were never spoken for you, Aquarius, as a megawatt conjunction between perceptive Mercury and blessed Jupiter helps blow the cobwebs out of your brain. Old ideas, values and opinions could wither up and fade away like the fall leaves under this auspicious aspect, to be replaced by new growth. You’re embarking on a mind-expanding journey. Get ready to embrace the future.

"
10448,12 october 2016,aquarius,"Money matters could be on your mind as the Moon inches closer to Neptune in your earnings sector. It’s imperative that you remain realistic about your finances, especially when it comes to funding big long-term goals, such as buying a house or setting aside college tuition for the kids. Disciplined Saturn demands it!

"
10449,13 october 2016,aquarius,"When we have good news or exciting plans it’s only natural to want to share. However, a tense Mercury-Mars square warns against too much disclosure. Mars and Pluto are in your twelfth house, which governs the shadow side of people. Someone in your circle may not be as straight forward and upright as you think. Think twice before you reveal too much.

"
10450,14 october 2016,aquarius,"Too many times people create grandiose plans that have a snowball’s chance in hell of succeeding. Not enough money, too little time, poorly laid plans–all of these can derail even the most promising project. But a terrific Mercury-Saturn connection today allows you to think big and come up with a plan that’s actually based on logic. Don’t be afraid to shoot for the stars; Saturn will make sure that you keep it real.

"
10451,15 october 2016,aquarius,"Keep a close eye on your thoughts and words as four planets are snarling at each other in the sectors that govern your mind and how you communicate. Negative thoughts or statements can erupt seemingly out of nowhere, and you don’t want to indulge in them today. Likewise someone else could be the source of harsh words, and they may try to get in your face. Lay low and avoid the trolls.

"
10452,16 october 2016,aquarius,"Got something to say? Then today’s full moon in your communication sector may push you to get the word out. Wrap up anything you’ve been working on, such as a thesis, contract, Powerpoint demonstration, piece of art, a music video or CD, anything that acts as a form of self-expression. But keep it positive, as maverick Uranus is in a tight position to the Moon. Don’t troll, rant or vent. And make sure that the projects you’re working on are polished so they shine.

"
10453,17 october 2016,aquarius,"Yesterday’s full moon in your candid house of conversation will still be felt in the week ahead, so get ready to sit down and talk with people who need to hear your opinion. Whether they’re ready for it or not is another issue. But today brings a helpful Moon-Pluto trine which ought to help you get to the bottom of things, especially family matters. Your peace of mind and contentment are too important to neglect.

"
10454,18 october 2016,aquarius,"This is no time to be a hermit, Aquarius! With the recent full moon in your very social third house you’re being encouraged to meet as many new people as possible, especially right in your own back yard. Today magnetic Venus glides into your eleventh house of camaraderie, pulling new contacts into your life from all areas: your industry, charitable organizations you might be interested in joining, even online connections on the other side of the globe. Reach out and connect.

"
10455,19 october 2016,aquarius,"Prophetic dreams, hunches, gut feelings—you may be getting bombarded with them lately as Mars has been inching closer to Pluto in your twelfth house of intuition and the psyche. Likewise, old fears, sorrows and hurts could be rising to the surface from your subconscious mind. Today these two orbs meet, providing you with the fire power to release old baggage for good. While your emotions may be running high and this may not be an easy task, this strong planetary aspect has the ability to take to you to a much higher, enlightened place.

"
10456,20 october 2016,aquarius,"Sunday’s full moon warned against opening your mouth: trolling, ranting, being too opinionated, and revealing too much. Today the cosmos is determined to make sure that you’ve gotten that message. Another thing to watch out for is that plans and projects you’re working on need to be refined and perfected before they can be presented to the world. So stay calm and focused, grasshopper, and keep your eye on the details.

"
10457,21 october 2016,aquarius,"Wednesday’s powerful Mars-Pluto conjunction may have brought strong emotions and thoughts to the forefront of your mind to be dealt with, and today you may be considering your work environment. If you head off every day to a soul sucking job that doesn’t fulfill you, or work with difficult people, you might feel more annoyed than usual. That’s OK though— the Sun’s entry into your success and ambition sector on Saturday bodes well for making positive changes.

"
10458,22 october 2016,aquarius,"You won’t need Tony Robbins to motivate you, Aquarius! The Sun will do the job, thank you very much, now that it’s in Scorpio, your tenth house of ambition and success. With clever Mercury about to hop into the same house on Monday, it’s time to get your priorities straight. Create goals, plan strategies, brainstorm, and reach out to mentors or decision makers who can help you progress. A terrific new moon here on the 30th is the perfect time to kick off fresh initiatives.

"
10459,23 october 2016,aquarius,"With the holidays coming you may have some serious spending on your mind, but the planets are warning you to keep a lid on expenses. A helpful Jupiter-Neptune angle today suggests that you sit down and create a solid budget, rather than flying by the seat of your pants when it comes to money. With Jupiter in your house of big plans and deceptive Neptune in the savings sector, you may be far too optimistic about cash flow.

"
10460,24 october 2016,aquarius,"Your mind will be more focused than a laser beam, Aquarius, now that quick witted Mercury has just joined the fiery Sun in your house of ambition. While the Sun helps point you in the right direction, it’s little Mercury that pushes you to draw up plans, prioritize, reach out to others who can help you and express your ideas. Thursday is a super day for progress.

"
10461,25 october 2016,aquarius,"Usually our friends provide us with winning advice as they know us better than anyone—and they want the best for us. But a tense Venus-Neptune angle today indicates that a pal or colleague could make a remark that will leave you feeling unsettled. You could also feel that a romantic relationship is off somehow. Let this pass, as tomorrow brings an upbeat vibe that will make this a distant memory.

"
10462,26 october 2016,aquarius,"Friends and colleagues could suggest some kind of venture, and you may want to consider it. Whether it’s a bachelorette party in Vegas, joining forces to kick off a charity, or starting an online company it could be one heck of a good time. Media attention, travel and even successful fund-raising and profits can be a part of this happy arrangement.

"
10463,27 october 2016,aquarius,"Ready to dazzle? Have your 15-second elevator pitch ready as the Sun forms a glorious aspect with communicator Mercury. The same holds true for your resume, a Powerpoint demonstration, your art portfolio and whatever other tools you need to impress. These two orbs are holding a power lunch in your career and ambition house, so this is serious stuff! This is  not a day to be shy.

"
10464,28 october 2016,aquarius,"Finish what you’ve already started before leaping into new activities. A zesty Moon-Jupiter aspect may get you fired up to take on new challenges, but trying to move forward before you have closed the door on other ones could create havoc. For your own peace of mind, slow down and do things the right way.

"
10465,29 october 2016,aquarius,"Just because a thought pops into your head doesn’t mean that you should express it out loud! As a matter of fact you’d be better off holding your tongue as erratic Uranus could prompt you to blurt out something that you shouldn’t. This is especially true when it comes to a matter involving a friend or a group that you’re involved with. Likewise, if you’re taking action toward some cherished goals, keep the details to yourself for the time being.

"
10466,30 october 2016,aquarius,"Yeah, baby! Gotta love today’s new moon in your career sector. Every year each sign of the zodiac receives a new moon in this part of their chart, but this one is more helpful than those of years past, Aquarius. That’s because profits planet Venus is a mere two degrees away from the moon, blessing it with bounty. Better yet is that intelligent Mercury, also in this ambitious house, forms a harmonious trine with Neptune in your earnings sector. Want to see more green? Then show people your innovative side.

"
10467,31 october 2016,aquarius,"Brand new opportunities are coming your way, things that can fulfill some lofty ambitions. The recent new moon will open doors. The question is–should you walk through all of them? Take your time as impatient Mars in your house of closure could make you way too anxious to move on to greener pastures. And erratic Uranus could find you babbling about situations that should be kept confidential for now. Say little and observe a lot.
 

"
10468,1 november 2016,aquarius,"With so much recent planetary activity in your career house no one could blame you for being confused about which direction to head in. The fog should begin to clear today thanks to the Sun’s influence. It appears that you need to get real about spending and budgeting for starters. Don’t kid yourself that you can stretch a dollar further. If you need to have more money coming in, you need to take action to make it happen.

"
10469,2 november 2016,aquarius,"You may have been teetering back and forth as to what to do regarding a career matter, but things are looking up. A recent Sun-Neptune trine is opening your eyes to a number of possibilities that you will be able to pursue in the weeks and months ahead. Neptune is retrograde, so if your concern is “show me the money”, you may need to wait for it to resume direct motion before you see more dinero. Fortunately the watery planet resumes forward motion on the 19th.

"
10470,3 november 2016,aquarius,"Superman, Zorro, the Green Hornet, Batman—all of these are archetypes of the strong silent type, the hero who doesn’t want or need recognition. As the Wizard of Oz said, “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.” And that’s the kind of vibe you have going on today, as powerful Pluto, in the most hidden part of your chart, meets up with the authoritative Sun. You’re stepping into your own power without a lot of fanfare, but who cares? Sometimes it’s more advantageous to be working quietly behind the scenes.

"
10471,4 november 2016,aquarius,"We all have faults and blind spots that plague us; no one is immune. But a strong moon-Pluto aspect allows you to identify your own flaws and inconsistencies. Strangely, this process may go much smoother than expected. You won’t need years of therapy! With the Sun in authoritative Scorpio you’ll be able to move forward with a greater sense of contentment and purpose.

"
10472,5 november 2016,aquarius,"Sometimes it seems that our plans and dreams are taking forever to manifest, and you start to wonder if they ever will. But today a happy Uranus-Venus trine may show you a glimmer of hope that changes are on the horizon. Make no mistake about it, you will need to take action in order to make things happen. But clinging to comfort and security may be holding you back. The full moon on the 14th will help you realize that.

"
10473,6 november 2016,aquarius,"If you have a goal or dream that you’d like to see happen, today and the early part of the week are perfect for talking about it with others. Seek out a mentor or someone who has already accomplished what you would like to manifest. Ask a trusted friend or family member for their advice. Attend a seminar that applies to your dream, or pick up a book on the topic. Uranus encourages you to open your mind and let new information flow in.

"
10474,7 november 2016,aquarius,"Got talent? Then don’t hide your light under a bushel. But it is perfectly OK to dazzle someone behind closed doors, like going on a job interview or holding a confidential meeting. People in positions of power may be holding back, but don’t let this frustrate you. Things will gain momentum by the end of the week.

"
10475,8 november 2016,aquarius,"Watch out world! Mars is just about ready to enter the sign of Aquarius on Wednesday, its first visit here in two years. Wrap up projects that you’ve been working on, create a short list of ambitions you’d like to achieve in the year ahead, and think about the things you need to snip out of your life for good. You have 24 hours to do s0—then it’s showtime!

"
10476,9 november 2016,aquarius,"Somebody has to be the center of attention, and it might as well be you! It’s birthday season in November as energetic Mars enters Aquarius today for the first time since 2014. Use the red planet’s abundance of energy to kickstart new projects and ambition that you’ve had in mind for some time now, whether it’s a fitness plan, a business launch or looking for a new house. While you’re at it, wrap up unfinished projects once Venus goes into Capricorn on Friday. The process should go smoother than you think and the peace of mind you gain will be terrific.

"
10477,10 november 2016,aquarius,"Can’t see the forest for the trees? You may have been so fixated as of late with going after some big projects or ambitions that you may have neglected some of the smaller stuff. You know–habits, routines, protocols, the fine details that actually add up to something big. Start focusing on how to just get through this day and week before you worry about achieving world domination.

"
10478,11 november 2016,aquarius,"Now that ambitious Mars is gracing your sign, it’s time to overcome inertia and get moving on pet projects. But keep your thoughts and plans to the confines of your trusted inner circle, as Venus just glided into your confidentiality sector. Her presence in this part of your chart could also make creative juices flow like wine, so get ready to get inspired.

"
10479,12 november 2016,aquarius,"Now that Mars is finally visiting your sign for the first time since 2014, you can start focusing on some big changes you’d like to make. And why not start with your social life? After all, there’s no such thing as having too many friends! Chatty, convivial Mercury zips into your house of camaraderie today, pushing you out the door to meet pals at a brunch spot–or for a shopping spree–or to plan a rager of a party. Don’t hold back!

"
10480,13 november 2016,aquarius,"Talks can heat up in the weeks ahead when it comes to joining forces with other people who share a common goal. Whether it’s a humanitarian cause that you’re interested in or creating an industry think tank, the connections you make can create waves–positive ones–well into the future. This is a time when the power of the masses can do so much more than an individual effort.

"
10481,14 november 2016,aquarius,"Major changes are afoot in a domestic or family situation as a full moon occurs in this part of your chart. Something may be reaching an end point, such as your willingness to deal with nosy parents, roommate or a kid’s attitude. Perhaps you’ve grown tired of the house you’re living in, or the neighborhood. The good news is that this lunation closes out an old chapter and opens up a better one, so get ready for positive changes. With Mars now in Aquarius you may need to be the one who takes charge, but so be it. You will  prevail.

"
10482,15 november 2016,aquarius,"A group activity may be picking up steam, such as your girlfriend’s bachelorette party, a charity event that you’re involved in, or a focus group at the office. And with assertive Mars in your sign, you could end up in the spotlight. But make sure that everyone knows their roles and that the budget for this project is well researched. Otherwise this could go off the rails in the near future. When the Sun enters Sagittarius on the 21st, clarity returns.

"
10483,16 november 2016,aquarius,"An assignment, whether it’s for school or work, may need more of a creative touch to make it shine. The good news is that with maverick Uranus in your house of self-expression, you can easily dazzle others with innovative ideas. You don’t always have to beat other people over the head to notice your worth. Sometimes it’s better to let your skills speak for themselves.

"
10484,17 november 2016,aquarius,"In order for new plans to gain momentum, you may need the advice of a mentor or friend who can help steer you in the right direction. You’re not lacking in ambition, not with the Sun in the success part of your chart. But you do need to tweak your methods to make sure that you’re working smart, not hard.

"
10485,18 november 2016,aquarius,"You’re sign is friendly by nature, and with the Sun about to enter your house of camaraderie you should enjoy a social month ahead. But the planets warn that you need to vet the people around you, especially when it comes to sharing your finances. This goes for close pals wanting to borrow money, being part of a (potentially very expensive) wedding party, going in on a beach house or even team projects, such as a charitable venture. Make sure that you know what you’re getting in to.

"
10486,19 november 2016,aquarius,"Looking for a raise? Trying to boost your company’s revenues? Then get ready for action as Neptune finally bolts forward after a five-month nap in your earnings sector. Indecisive clients may now sign deals, bosses could approve promotions or you could launch a business idea that will bring home some serious bacon. But keep your ideas and negotiations under wraps, as profitable and helpful Venus is sequestered in your hush-hush house of confidentiality.

"
10487,20 november 2016,aquarius,"Now that Mars is in your sign for the first time in two years, you’re a person on a mission. And today’s goal is to cut loose with people you adore and have some fun. Spontaneous Uranus urges you to pick up the phone and call someone, even if you haven’t spoken in awhile or they live on the other side of the planet. With the Sun entering the friendliest part of your chart tomorrow, it’s people–not material things –that will mean the most to you.

"
10488,21 november 2016,aquarius,"It’s time to expand your list of contacts, which should be easy to do now that the Sun is in Sagittarius, your house of networking. The people you meet in the weeks and year ahead will open your mind to new possibilities, as if a fresh breeze is blowing through your brain. Optimistic viewpoints, radically different philosophies, and a happy way of savoring life to the fullest is what they can teach you.

"
10489,22 november 2016,aquarius,"Brilliant ideas are a dime a dozen; it’s execution of them that counts. You have no shortage of smart concepts, ambition or optimistic thinking, so get moving! Today’s planetary aspects are positively visionary. Working on your behalf is sober, rational Saturn, the planet that will enable you to move forward without rose colored glasses-type thinking.

"
10490,23 november 2016,aquarius,"Our lives become richer, in part, by meeting new people and going after passion projects that add to our personal growth. The cosmos delivers a gift to you today in the form of a Mercury-Saturn conjunction, a meeting of two intelligent and forward-thinking planets. The new few weeks will rock for socializing with existing pals, sharing ideas with industry colleagues, and meeting new faces (some of them sexy indeed). It’s also an auspicious time to plan your long range future, as the rose colored glasses will be off and logical thinking will prevail.

"
10491,24 november 2016,aquarius,"No guts, no glory! Remaining hidden in a little protective shell isn’t the best way to go through life. The cosmos is encouraging you to think more optimistically and toss out old, self-limiting beliefs. While you’re at it, stop feeling sorry for yourself and wallowing in drama. Happy-go-lucky Jupiter is now in your corner for the first time in 13 years, so it’s time to blossom.

"
10492,25 november 2016,aquarius,"New people may start showing up in your life, both the business and the personal side. Your natural gregariousness may encourage you to warm up to them quickly, but is that wise? Hold back a bit, especially when it comes to your most private thoughts and big plans. Learn whom to trust before you share.

"
10493,26 november 2016,aquarius,"The people in your orbit can be surprisingly lucky for you in the days ahead, so make every effort to get out there and spend time with them. A pal could introduce you to your future spouse, tip you off about a job opening or be a sounding board for some fresh ideas that you’d like some input on. Working with others on a team basis could also get you much further than flying solo, so consider partnering up.

"
10494,27 november 2016,aquarius,"Ouch! Don’t step on anyone’s toes today, Aquarius. A tense Moon-Mars angle nay make you feel way  too big for your britches. Unless you want people calling you Mr. or Ms. Bossy Pants behind your back, keep the attitude dialed down a notch. You’re going to need people in your corner, especially with this week’s new moon falling in your house of networking and team efforts.

"
10495,28 november 2016,aquarius,"You won’t be suffering from a shortage of energy, ambition and bright ideas, but your cash flow is another story altogether. Perform due diligence before you leap into anything with a price tag attached–college, having another baby, starting a business, that big vacation–as Neptune is clouding your vision. Make sure that you have plenty in the bank first and don’t run up your credit cards.

"
10496,29 november 2016,aquarius,"Come out of your shell! The new moon in Sagittarius is all about meeting new people. Toss out preconceived notions about the “right type” of friend, lover or teammate. Now’s the time to start expanding your circle to folks who are different. Maybe they’re more creative, from a different ethnic group, or they espouse a contrasting philosophy to yours. They say that people make the world go round, and in your case, new pals can add a lot to your world.

"
10497,30 november 2016,aquarius,"Slacker alert! Make sure that you don’t get the wrong end of the stick today as deceptive Neptune is playing games with all the signs of the zodiac. People around you may wimp out on their responsibilities, expecting you to soldier on bravely and pick up their slack. Sorry, it doesn’t work that way. Let them know that guilt, passive-aggressive antics and flattery aren’t going to work with you.

"
10498,1 december 2016,aquarius,"Well, someone has to be the center of attention, dazzling everyone in a 50 foot radius, and it might as well be you Aquarius! With va-va-va-voom  Mars now in your sign forming a spectacular angle with lucky Jupiter, don’t hide your light from the world today. Your optimism should rise, with the feeling that you can achieve just about anything you set your mind to. But keep any major brainstorms under wraps for a few weeks as Mercury enters your house of confidentiality tomorrow.

"
10499,2 december 2016,aquarius,"Watch out, Long Island Medium. Mercury has just entered Aquarius’s twelfth house of intuition, making them the vibiest people on the planet right now. It joins Pluto, the planet known for its ability to plumb the subterranean depths of the human psyche, as well as easy-going Venus. Don’t try to fool an Aquarian. They’re like bloodhounds, and with assertive Mars in their sign they’ll let you know what they’re thinking.

"
10500,3 december 2016,aquarius,"A sparkling Mars-Saturn aspect is asking you to think long and hard about your aspirations for 2017. A week from now, you’ll have to make some serious decisions, so consider your options today. Saturn doesn’t play around, demanding hard work and sticking to good solid habits and routines. But if you do that, the ringed planet promises that you’ll see results.

"
10501,4 december 2016,aquarius,"Let your freak flag fly! It’s time for you to let the world know who you really are, so don’t hold back. A terrific Mars-Moon-Jupiter aspect today encourages you to express your opinions and let your personality shine. If other people cant handle it that’s their problem. However, it looks like the right kind of people will embrace who you’re becoming, so go for it.

"
10502,5 december 2016,aquarius,"With the Moon and Mars both in your sign, don’t think that you’re selfish for thinking about you! Just wait until Wednesday when Venus joins them; then you’ll really be on a roll. Yup, your needs, desires and dreams are front and center these days, and the passionate Moon is really stimulating you to take your ideas and run with them. Over the next 48 hours some ground breaking ideas may pop into your head.

"
10503,6 december 2016,aquarius,"With lovely Venus getting ready to enter your sign tomorrow, you’re looking like the cat’s pajamas. And as any cool cat can tell you, they draw admirers—kind of like catnip! Therefore, don’t be surprised if someone—a potential lover, boss or existing friend—calls you out of the blue with the aim of talking bidness, romance or just having fun. With spontaneous Uranus acting up, anything can happen.

"
10504,7 december 2016,aquarius,"Oh yeah! Ain’t you the hottest thing on two legs. Sex bomb Venus just entered Aquarius, making you the person to watch! Since Venus governs beauty, the next three weeks are the perfect time to doll yourself up. Maybe a new hair style, some chic new outfits and some cosmetic procedures should be on the agenda. And while you’re at it, don’t forget a massage—and a glass of champagne is most definitely a prerequisite.

"
10505,8 december 2016,aquarius,"“Adventure” is your middle name these days, Aquarius! With four celestial orbs pushing you to take risks as you focus on your most closely held desires, you may feel unstoppable. Fortunately you have a few other planets in the more cautious part of your chart, urging you to consider the moves you make. There’s nothing wrong with developing momentum as long as you take time outs now and then to assess your progress, as well as the practicality of your goals.

"
10506,9 december 2016,aquarius,"It’s nothing but green lights ahead with a super Sun/Jupiter aspect. Big dreams can take flight as your efforts have been noticed by people who are decision makers. But even though the cosmos is encouraging you to team up with others, with Mars in Aquarius you can make a heck of a lot of headway on your own.

"
10507,10 december 2016,aquarius,"Put a fork in it—it’s over.  Done, cooked, finished. A megawatt meeting between the Sun and Saturn helps you to finally put an end to anything or anyone in your life that is not adding to your journey, but instead is taking away. As a result today may feel heavy, because being honest with ourselves is not always an easy task. Sometimes we  are the problem and change must begin within. Consider this as a gift, however. The more toxic stuff you take to the trash now will free you up for a fabulous birthday season ahead.

"
10508,11 december 2016,aquarius,"What do mac and cheese, hot chocolate and Grandma’s cookies all have in common? They’re comfort foods, along with homemade stews and soups. The cosmos tells you to get in touch with your warm and fuzzy side, that part of all of us that craves old fashioned comforts. Whether that means good food, good company or a beautifully decorated abode, nurturing yourself this way will provide some very happy psychological benefits.

"
10509,12 december 2016,aquarius,"If you want to move ahead with certain passions and projects, the best way to go about it is to network. Talk to industry insiders, find a mentor or coach, ask a trusted friend for advice, let everyone know you’re looking for a mate. This is no time to sit at home on the couch waiting for the cavalry to ride in and rescue you. Serendipity rules today, so you never know who might be able to help you.

"
10510,13 december 2016,aquarius,"Love is in the air with today’s full moon in your house of romance, but so is drama! Something may be coming to a close, such as moving from the dating stage to living together. If you want to keep your sanity in the weeks ahead it would be wise not to plunge into anything without calmly determining if the two of you are right for each other. With dynamic Mars just about ready to move into your house of security and guarantees, you’ll need to know for sure which way the wind is blowing.

"
10511,14 december 2016,aquarius,"Too many chefs spoil the sauce! That’s the dilemma as you seem to be surrounded by people who all want their way, or at the very least for their voice to be heard. The noise may get louder in the days ahead, so if you need some quiet time to chill and consider what’s going on, take a break. The best time to do so is after the 19th when Mercury goes retrograde in your house of silence, reflection and closure. Use this valuable time period to see beneath the surface of things.

"
10512,15 december 2016,aquarius,"Despite your desire to get things done, there could be interruptions today that stall your progress. With the Moon in the most efficient part of your chart you may get easily annoyed with the people or situations that are slowing you down. Take a deep breath and count to ten. When energetic Mars moves into your house of routines and protocols next week, you’ll be able to steamroll over things that are in your way.

"
10513,17 december 2016,aquarius,"Put a ring on it? With the Moon in your commitment sector you may be interested—very interested—in the direction a certain relationship is going in. Maybe you want a baby, or another date, or more quality time with an amour. Now’s the time to talk about the future, and you may be surprised that even a commitment-phobic partner will open up.

"
10514,18 december 2016,aquarius,"This is the last day in awhile that you’ll be hosting assertive Mars in your sign, so give some thought as to what you’d like to achieve in 2017. Your goals and dreams are paramount, but today a tense Moon-Mars angle indicates that you may be worried that others won’t go along with your plans. The reality may be that you  are the cause of your fears and concerns more so than others. When Mars enters Pisces tomorrow your sense of self-worth will increase.

"
10515,19 december 2016,aquarius,"The planet Mars can act like a double edged sword and today it rolls into your house of money: making it, spending it and saving it. Play it safe and avoid the urge to spend, a strong possibility with the aggressive red planet here. Mercury retrogrades also in your house of confidentiality, making the next few weeks a good time to quietly seek a new job or research a business launch.

"
10516,20 december 2016,aquarius,"With aggressive Mars now in your income sector you’re probably raring to go when it comes to earning more. But don’t move so quickly that you overlook all of the beneficial opportunities that are out there. Don’t assume that you have to grab the first deal that is offered to you, as over the next seven weeks there could be a number of them. Some of them may require some digging as they won’t be obvious, but the hunt could be worth it.

"
10517,21 december 2016,aquarius,"If any sign of the zodiac needs some R&R these days it’s you, Aquarius! Not only do you need some peace and serenity, but according to the planets you could also benefit from some practical changes to your life. Which means examining your habits and routines to see if they’re making your life more discombobulated or more relaxed. Streamlined, well thought out habits make it easier to go through life on automatic pilot. Use the slow pace of next week to get your act together.

"
10518,22 december 2016,aquarius,"Think before you speak as an emotional Moon-Jupiter connection could stir up deep seated feelings…and powerful words. Likewise, you could be on the receiving end of someone else’s strong opinions, which may not sit well with you. With a new moon arriving on the 29th in your house of healing and closure, you’d be wise to wait til then to sort out your thoughts.

"
10519,23 december 2016,aquarius,"New Year’s Day is over a week away, but your mind may turn to increasing your cash flow in 2017. Maybe it’s the holiday spending, maybe it’s just the desire to feel more secure, but either way your motivation to save more will grow. Next week is perfect for setting aside some quiet time for strategizing.

"
10520,24 december 2016,aquarius,"Speaking your mind and letting the world know what you’re all about should become easier in the weeks ahead. A sparkling and rare Saturn-Uranus aspect today helps kick off a period in which you can become more visible and respected. Tomorrow is even better for expressing yourself to friends, lovers and family.

"
10521,25 december 2016,aquarius,"The cosmos has a sweet gift for you on Christmas Day, and it’s called renewed self esteem. Lovely and gentle Venus is in your sign, forming a number of positive aspects with other planets. It’s time for a new look, a different way of thinking and maybe even some new friends or business contacts. The 29th is a good day to start initiating conversations.

"
10522,26 december 2016,aquarius,"It’s a super day to entertain discussions about a new job or a promotion that has more money attached, but you have to tread warily. Verbal Mercury is in the house of confidentiality, so keep a lid on your plans and negotiations. Furthermore, a tense standoff between Jupiter and Uranus warns that you shouldn’t come off as being too opinionated. And if you have some excellent ideas to propose, don’t put them on the table too soon. Get paid for your brilliance!

"
10523,27 december 2016,aquarius,"Your intuition is on overdrive, and chances are it’s highly accurate too. This isn’t a temporary situation either, but something that you will be experiencing for the next three weeks. As a result pay close attention to gut hunches you receive. Today you might get a hunch about a financial situation that could pay off in spades.

"
10524,28 december 2016,aquarius,"Life is too short to settle, Aquarius, and you may be getting tired of watching others have all the fun. If you find that you’ve been daydreaming quite a bit, imagining a happier future, it’s not surprising–tomorrow’s new moon is in the house of the subconscious mind. However, with ambitious Mars charging through your house of routines and planning, you may find it possible to take those dreams and make them a workable reality.

"
10525,29 december 2016,aquarius,"If you’d like to start off 2017 without carrying a lot of emotional baggage with you, then today’s new moon in Capricorn is just the ticket for finding some peace of mind. Over the next two weeks you can dig deep and toss old, outdated ideas that have been weighing you down. With Mars and Neptune active in Pisces, an increased sense of self-esteem will emerge.

"
10526,30 december 2016,aquarius,"Why are you holding back? Uranus just went direct in your house of self-expression, encouraging you to put yourself out there–your opinions, ideas, written pieces, artwork, proposals–but you don’t seem anxious to do so. It could be due to yesterday’s new moon in the house of the subconscious mind, stirring up doubts and insecurities. That’s OK. By New Year’s Day your confidence will return.

"
10527,31 december 2016,aquarius,"To thine own self be true! It’s time to get back to the essence of who you really are, Aquarius. Quit worrying about what other people think about you and the roles they might want you to play. The recent new moon encouraged you to toss out old ways of thinking that no longer serve you, and this is one area that needs to be addressed.

"
10528,1 january 2017,pisces,"Everyone had better get out of your way! With megawatt Mars meeting up with Neptune today in your sign, absolutely nothing is going to stop a Pisces this year from going after their ambitions. 2017 is all about your  needs and aspirations for once, so don’t feel selfish about pursuing your own dreams. And if having a juicier love life is part of your plan, magnetic Venus enters your house of amore on the 3rd for a one-month stay.

"
10529,2 january 2017,pisces,"With the Moon forming a perfect angle today with Mars and Neptune, your spirits should be lifting. Maybe you’ve sold yourself short in the past, not really believing that you can pull off certain aspirations. But confidence should be creeping in to replace fear and doubt. When Venus enters your sign tomorrow you’ll feel even stronger.

"
10530,3 january 2017,pisces,"Hey there, you sexy thang. It’s not enough that glamorous Neptune is in your house of self-image along with charismatic Mars. Hell no, now you Pisces folks have latched on to alluring Venus too! The planet of beauty and luxury has just entered your sign for four weeks. Remember that commercial for hair products, the one that said, “Don’t hate me because I’m beautiful”? Work it, Pisces. Let the haters hate!

"
10531,4 january 2017,pisces,"With so much planetary firepower in your sign, you may be raring to go with your 2017 plans. Aggressive Mars in Pisces is saying, “Go, go, go!” but….Mercury retrogrades today in your house of ambition and success. This is a short window of time, just until the 12th, so spend a few days reconsidering your plans before you charge ahead

"
10532,5 january 2017,pisces,"Show me the money! You may be ready to shout that from the rooftops as the Moon connects with rebellious Uranus in your income sector. But with Mercury currently in retrograde motion in your career house, being forceful about seeing more green could backfire. When the messenger planet goes direct on Sunday you’ll be in a much better spot to speak up. By the way, if you want to earn more.expand your contact list. There is definitely a “it’s not what you know, but who you know” vibe going on for Pisces right now.

"
10533,6 january 2017,pisces,"Wrap up any major negotiations you have going on with a client or prospective employer. Put the finishing touches on a product, service, website or marketing plan you’ve been working on too. Mercury is retrograde in this part of your chart, a helpful aspect as it gives you time to review your activities. It resumes direct motion on Sunday, so get ready for forward movement.

"
10534,7 january 2017,pisces,"Your sign is known for its ability to work well in solitude but the cosmos has another plan for you, Pisces. The Sun and Pluto meet up today in your eleventh house of teamwork, a highly auspicious aspect that can bring movers and shakers into all areas of your life. Consider joining an industry think tank or taking a seminar that will be full of like minded people. Join a charity or volunteer group with folks who share your passion for improving the world. Rally people in your neighborhood to create a community vegetable garden. But this is also the house of technology, so any kind of digital venture (such as an online store, blog, website or coding an app) can take off like a shot. With Pluto and the Sun involved, strategy is key.

"
10535,8 january 2017,pisces,"Mmmm, the sweet smell of success. You might start catching a whiff of it now that Mercury is direct in your highly ambitious tenth house. Not all of the road blocks will be out of your way, but keep your eye on the big picture and keep pushing on. With mighty Mars in your sign you’re a force to be reckoned with–don’t forget that.

"
10536,9 january 2017,pisces,"You’re the envy of the zodiac, Pisces, as you’re kicking off 2017 with dynamic Mars in your sign. If anyone ought to be off and running with audacious goals and plans it’s you! But the moody blues could strike as the Moon enters an emotional spot today, perhaps making you doubt yourself, or creating concern that you’re trying to take on too much. The good news is that power broker Pluto has your back and will help point out the flaws as well as the benefits in your actions. Sally forth.

"
10537,10 january 2017,pisces,"You’re absolutely visionary these days Pisces, thanks to the Sun and Pluto both in your house of big ideas. The problem is that not everyone shares your vision, ambition or strategy as to how to get things done. As a result don’t expect everyone to sign on right away, but don’t give up hope either. When Mercury changes signs on Thursday you’ll be in a better position to make progress.

"
10538,11 january 2017,pisces,"With aggressive Mars in your sign, you are definitely in the mood for getting things done. And with tomorrow’s full moon in your house of romance and enjoying life, you’ll be motivated to treat yourself to some good times with the people you love! However, friends and colleagues may not be on the same page, putting up resistance to your ideas. A group effort especially may start going off the rails, whether it’s planning a family reunion or a task force at the office. Not to worry. When Mercury enters Capricorn tomorrow you’ll be able to get it back on track.

"
10539,12 january 2017,pisces,"Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou? Art thou on the same page as me? That may be the question in your mind as today’s full moon stars up drama in close relationships. A romance could be quite passionate, but where is it headed? Do you both want the same things? Singles need to watch the tendency to compare themselves to friends, or to rush into a romance out of loneliness. That being said, this lunation could bring out the passion and amour in all Pisces, so enjoy it!

"
10540,13 january 2017,pisces,"Well ain’t you somethin’! The two most amorous planets in the solar system, Venus and Neptune, meet up today in Pisces, making you a sight for sore eyes. You should be feeling pretty frisky today as yesterday’s full moon fell in your house of romance. This is an excellent time for a makeover, as the lunation occurred in one of the most creative parts of your chart. Who would you like to be?

"
10541,14 january 2017,pisces,"Sweet seduction! With the two most romantic planets, Venus and Neptune, meeting up in Pisces you’re more than ready to start living a more sizzling life. But it takes two to tango, and if your lover isn’t making your heart sing, you may need to make a big decision. When the Sun enters Aquarius next week you will enter into a deeply reflective stage, not only about love but life in general. If anything or anyone is making you unhappy you may quietly determine to move on. Take your time and think things over, as this vibe will continue into late February.

"
10542,15 january 2017,pisces,"Love planet Venus is active today, prompting you to consider a makeover: a chic new hair style, a different look with makeup, perhaps a big wardrobe change. But do it for yourself, not someone else. You’re in quite an independent mood these days, and your self-image should be a manifestation of your authentic self, not what other people expect of you.

"
10543,16 january 2017,pisces,"What about me? That thought may be on your mind as you realize that your own desires need to be met. Planets in your relationship and friends sectors are pushing you to be a team player, but at some point you just gotta look out for #1. Otherwise your resentment may bubble out of you like a volcano that’s releasing pent up steam. Once the Sun enters Aquarius on Thursday you’ll have four weeks of “me” time.

"
10544,17 january 2017,pisces,"Megawatt Mars in your house of self-image is just the ticket for a makeover, so if you’re changing up your looks you know why. But the red planet also asks you to consider your image on a more emotional level. How intimate are you with a lover; how much do you share? Do you tend to dwell in unhappy thoughts? It’s time for some inner work, Pisces, something that will become more apparent after the Sun enters aquarius.

"
10545,18 january 2017,pisces,"It’s time for an emotional tuneup! With healing Jupiter in the part of your chart that deals with cleansing your psyche, you can make headway today when it comes to improving your state of mind. This is just the beginning, however. This vibe continues well into February, right up to your birthday season. The new moon on the 27th can bring about a breakthrough.

"
10546,19 january 2017,pisces,"Isaac Newton correctly stated that a body in motion will remain in motion unless a force stops it. That’s Newton’s First Law, and you’re going to get a taste of it today. The problem is that aggressive Mars is in your sign, wanting to put rocket boosters on your plans. But sober Saturn is the force that’s going to act against this, creating drag and friction. Red tape, indecisive or uncooperative people and circumstances that aren’t gelling could create frustration. Get used to it—this will be in play for at least another week. Relief arrives when Mars enters Aries on the 28th

"
10547,20 january 2017,pisces,"Tone it down a notch, Pisces. Yes, Mars and Venus are in your sign, adding swagger to your step. But the Sun just entered your hush-hush twelfth house yesterday for a four-week stay. Bragging, showing off, getting in someone’s face, or even being open about your plans and goals have no place right now. Hide your light while you quietly work behind the scenes.

"
10548,21 january 2017,pisces,"Nothing big in life is achieved by thinking small. Just ask any inventor, self-made millionaire, humanitarian or Nobel winning scientist, they’ll tell you—they had to firmly believe in the “beauty of their dreams”, to quote Eleanor Roosevelt. How expansive and visionary are your dreams? A happy Moon-Chiron aspect today helps you think bigger.

"
10549,22 january 2017,pisces,"The planets are stirring up the depths of your subconscious mind, perhaps making you aware that changes need to be made with your thoughts and emotions. A helpful Moon-Sun aspect today helps you recognize that if you want to achieve certain ambitions, that you need a little help. Seek out the advice of an expert, whether it’s a self help author, a therapist or a wise mentor.

"
10550,23 january 2017,pisces,"Your head and your heart may be pulling you in two different directions when it comes to a big goal or aspiration. Planetary influences recommend that you use your head more, as foggy Neptune could cloud your judgment. This is no time for rose colored glasses or pie in the sky thinking. Keep it real.

"
10551,24 january 2017,pisces,"You’re in an excellent position to win people over to your side today, Pisces. Diplomacy and open conversations are the name of the game, so don’t be afraid to express your view point. Better yet is that you can come up with some creative solutions to problems that may have been plaguing you, a partnership or a group effort. Be sure to share them with others.

"
10552,25 january 2017,pisces,"The upcoming new moon on Friday falls in the most reflective part of your chart, the twelfth house. This is where we make decisions to cut things from our lives that are no longer working or aren’t helping us on our journey. One of the biggest questions you need to ask yourself right now is about the company you keep. Who’s true blue, and who isn’t? Are there commitments that are taking up too much time, such as clubs or industry meetings? Are you hanging out with people who share your values? Take an inventory as the new moon will be a turning point.

"
10553,26 january 2017,pisces,"Manage your emotions! Gentle Venus is in your house of self, encouraging you to get a better handle on your feelings. Jealousy, fear, obsession, anger, resentment, boredom, anxiety—whatever negative emotions and thoughts that you’re experiencing, it’s time for them to go. Fortunately Venus is linked today to optimistic Jupiter and with their help you can easily heal and release toxic patterns.

"
10554,27 january 2017,pisces,"Healing, cleansing and nurturing—your tired body and mind need these desperately, and today’s new moon in Aquarius is your signal to slow down. Nobody can take better care of you than you, Pisces, and with disciplined Saturn by your side you can take charge of your progress. Set appointments with your doctor or masseuse. Confide in a good friend or a therapist. Take long walks in nature or spend a few hours immersed in a good book. Between now and August you’ll be able to see results as you become more serene and centered.

"
10555,28 january 2017,pisces,"Your finances can take a turn for the better as dynamic Mars charges into your house of earnings today. Truth be told, you can spend too much when Mars is here, but as long as you keep a pragmatic eye on your wallet you should be OK. Chances are that you won’f find financial success by working alone. The planets recommend expanding your contact list via networking, especially reaching out to mentors and power brokers.

"
10556,29 january 2017,pisces,"Some of your closest relationships can come under a microscope today as Mercury and Pluto meet up in your networking sector. Truth be told, under current planetary aspects you’re looking for only the true bluest of friends and colleagues. If you suspect that someone doesn’t have your best interests at heart, or that of the group, it may be time to make some changes. Between Mercury’s intelligence and Pluto’s ability to sniff out problems, you’ll be able to pull this off without a problem.

"
10557,30 january 2017,pisces,"You could be in a dreamy state of mind as the Moon and Neptune combine their mystic energies. Which is fine….as long as you pay attention to the demands of your real life. Pour this misty energy into your sensuality while you keep your rational mind firmly focused on dollars and cents.

"
10558,31 january 2017,pisces,"Does everyone in your circle know what their responsibilities are? Do they appreciate the need to stay on task and on budget? If you sense confusion or slacking off, it’s time to grab control before your plans go off the rails. You have too much invested in this to let that happen. Use your sixth sense to guide you as it’s right on target.

"
10559,1 february 2017,pisces,"“Show me the money!”  Famous line from a movie, along with “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore!”. And that could be your mindset today, especially where your income is concerned. Hey, this can work in your favor if you channel your frustration about not having enough money into making more. The good news is that Venus, one of the planets that governs profits, is scheduled to move into your income house on Friday for an unusually long stay.

"
10560,2 february 2017,pisces,"Speak now or forever hold your peace! Mouthy Mars is in your house of self-expression, so don’t hold back if something needs to be said. There’s no need to beat people over the head with your message, however. There’s a difference between speaking with aggression and speaking with passion. Choose passion and let your words shine.

"
10561,3 february 2017,pisces,"Money talks and it should be talking to you—loudly—over the next few months. Today Venus enters your income sector, a boon for those of you looking for a higher paying gig or more robust revenues. While this could definitely help you pull in more cash, you’re advised to save and invest it carefully with Jupiter about to retrograde in your house of financial security next week. It’s an excellent time to get a side business going or a passive income stream.

"
10562,4 february 2017,pisces,"If you and someone close need to get on the same page, this weekend is a good time to start. Jupiter will be heading retrograde in your intimacy sector on Monday were it will remain for four months. Your best bet is to clear the air between now and March 4th, after which time it will be tougher to reach an agreement.

"
10563,5 february 2017,pisces,"It appears from your chart that you need a break, Pisces, and the cosmos is getting ready to give you one. Today a tense Moon-Neptune aspect may make you all too aware of the demands that your family or lover are placing on you. Fortunately Mercury enters your restorative twelfth house on Tuesday, letting you retreat into your own world for several weeks for some extreme self care.

"
10564,6 february 2017,pisces,"The ancients in their wisdom placed “sharing” in the same astrological house—sharing bodies, emotions and financial assets. They understood that as people become more connected to each other, that their lives become intertwined in so many ways. Abundant Jupiter has been in this part of the sky since September but now retrogrades for four months, indicating that you need to take a second look at intimacy and net worth along with your romantic partner. Even if you’re single, it’s crucial to examine what you expect from a lover and to build a strong financial base. Slow down, cut back on spending, research investments, talk things over, examine emotions like jealousy and resentment and heal your soul. By early June you’ll be in a much different place.

"
10565,7 february 2017,pisces,"If there was ever a time to flush negative emotions and thought patterns down the toilet, it’s now, Pisces. Mercury just entered your twelfth house of cleansing and closure where it will remain for the next three weeks. Truth be told, this could be an intense time, but getting to the root of unease is never effortless. The good news is that this Friday’s eclipse will help you develop solid habits that will enable you to move forward.

"
10566,8 february 2017,pisces,"Sometimes it seems as though our plans and dreams are never going to work out, which certainly can lead to frustration and sadness. Today a tense Moon-Pluto aspect could make you feel that way, but know that this soon shall pass. Friday’s lunar eclipse in Leo will give you a swift kick in the pants, motivating you to take greater control as you come up with a logical plan of action.

"
10567,9 february 2017,pisces,"Inspiration strikes, and it has dollar signs attached. Pay attention to any ideas that seem to come from the ether as they could be be worth their weight in gold. This vibe continues into the weekend, and Friday’s lunar eclipse is an added benefit. It falls in your highly efficient house of getting things done. Get inspired, then create a plan and work it.

"
10568,10 february 2017,pisces,"It’s time to get your act together, Pisces—big time. Unbalanced checkbooks, cluttered closets, work piling up on your desk, a flabby tummy, e-mails that need to be deleted, employees that need to be excessed—all of this has to go, pronto. Tonight’s lunar eclipse in Leo will kick you square in the pants and make you get moving, whether you want to or not! But this is a happy lunation, so chances are that you’ll be motivated to dive in. It’s an excellent aspect for improving your health too, and you may discover that new habits are easier to establish than expected.

"
10569,11 february 2017,pisces,"Tremendous emotional healing can take place in the days ahead if you’re open to the idea. Jupiter’s retrograde spin is designed to help you release old pent-up feelings, including anger and resentment. Developing strong friendships is also in the stars, so reach out to people who are simpatico.

"
10570,12 february 2017,pisces,"As Valentine’s Day approaches, many people have love on their minds. But you may be taking a rather hard headed approach toward romance as it appears that you want more control over what goes on in your love life. The Moon might be making you feel testy today, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Who wants to feel as though they have no say-so in their relationship? The 14th helps you get everything out on the table.

"
10571,13 february 2017,pisces,"Some adjustments need to be made to a romantic alliance. You have needs and desires that must be met, Pisces, so if you’re selling yourself short it’s time for a wakeup call. The same goes for singles who have been more worried about pleasing a lover than themselves. Tomorrow is a good day to call the shots in love, but you won’t have to be forceful about it.

"
10572,14 february 2017,pisces,"What can I say? Pull down the shades, Pisces, because the Moon and Jupiter are both in your sexy eighth house for Valentine’s Day. But with other planets in your house of tradition and luxury, you’ll also want to go the champagne and candlelight route for dinner. Singles, a serious contender is on the horizon but it may take some “digging” to find them. Is it possible there’s someone you’ve been overlooking?

"
10573,15 february 2017,pisces,"First, the good news: Mars is in your income sector for the first time in two years. This can help you land a raise or increase revenues. Now for the bad news: Mars in this part of the sky can run up spending. Today, a dicey Jupiter opposition could make you overly optimistic about your financial picture, to the point where you might spend money you shouldn’t. Keep the credit cards hidden and avoid borrowing money if you possibly can. You have excellent aspects for earning more, but you need to sock some cash away first.

"
10574,16 february 2017,pisces,"Your intuition will be spot on about a career or money matter, so go with your gut. With the Sun about to enter your sign your self-esteem should be on the rise. Be more willing to take chances as they could pay off handsomely.

"
10576,18 february 2017,pisces,"Woo-hoo! Your official birthday season is here, Pisces. Get ready for an exciting month ahead, especially with the last solar eclipse in your sign on the 26th. Chances are that you’re not the same old guy or gal you were back in 2015 when this series of eclipse began. It’s time to strut your stuff and take ownership of your power. You’re going to surprise a lot of people, but hey, they could use some shaking up.

"
10577,19 february 2017,pisces,"Now that the Sun is in your sign you can start taking action on things that mean a lot to you. However, with chatty Mercury in your house of secrecy (an oxymoron to be sure), you shouldn’t be blabbing your ideas to everyone, at least for the next few days. Keep your cards close to your vest, especially on Wednesday.

"
10578,20 february 2017,pisces,"Confusion about money matters or the direction your career is heading in could clear up, and quickly at that. Intelligent Mercury will be in your house of intuition just for one more week, so use it to your advantage. Today genius Uranus sends sparkling beams to Mercury, so get ready to get inspired. A smart income boosting idea could come your way.

"
10579,21 february 2017,pisces,"Some quiet reflection could go a long way as you make the decision to start treating yourself better. Meditation, yoga, mindfulness, reiki, prayer–all of these can work wonders. Go within; your soul is waiting for you.

"
10580,22 february 2017,pisces,"All that glitters is not gold, Pisces. Be discerning about the people you spend time with and your plans for the future. Often times we stick with certain people and goals out of habit, when in actuality we have outgrown them. If something or someone no longer holds a dazzling allure for you, acknowledge it–then adjust and move on.

"
10581,23 february 2017,pisces,"With stern Saturn in your house of authority you’re in no mood for dealing with nonsense and game playing. However, a diplomatic Mercury-Saturn meet up will enable you to get your point across without offending the sensitive egos of others. They’d better get used to hearing your opinion in the weeks ahead.

"
10582,24 february 2017,pisces,"Get a good idea as to where you want to head with your finances over the next six months. Sunday’s solar eclipse occurs in your sign, the last one in a series that began in 2015. A hush-hush meeting of the Moon and profits planet Venus today bodes well for some quiet strategizing.

"
10583,25 february 2017,pisces,"Your birthday season is going to take off like a house on fire over the next few days, Pisces. First, sociable Mercury enters your sign today, helping you focus on your personal goals and desires. Then a solar eclipse tomorrow will wipe the slate clean, enabling you to move away from past dramas. It’s time to move on.

"
10584,26 february 2017,pisces,"You’re not the same person you used to be, Pisces. A series of eclipses in your sign over the past two years has pushed you into new places that are destined to bring about immense personal growth. It may not have been easy, and you may not understand yet why certain things have happened, but today the last eclipse in this series takes place. Between now and August you could manifest important new connections and circumstances.

"
10585,27 february 2017,pisces,"Yesterday’s solar eclipse in your sign lit a fire under you to get moving with your plans, but take it slow today. Aggressive Mars is in one hellacious mood, meeting up with his unpredictable brother-in-arms, Uranus. It’s the perfect storm for doing something stupid, like quitting the day job to open a tiki bar on an island somewhere. Or yelling at the boss that you deserve a raise, and dammit, when are you going to see it? Chill, grasshopper.

"
10586,28 february 2017,pisces,"Slow and steady wins the race, Pisces. Don’t let others rush you into getting things done, as mistakes will be made—and you’ll get stuck cleaning them up. The recent solar eclipse in your sign has no doubt inspired you to get moving on a lot of personal plans, so focus on your own goals rather than getting sucked in to the agendas of other people.

"
10587,1 march 2017,pisces,"What a week you’ve been having, Pisces! Last Sunday there was a solar eclipse in your sign, and today the Sun and Neptune meet up there. It’s all good—amazing, actually. Considering that Neptune is the planet of inspiration, your desire to try new things and stretch past old limits should be increasing. Saturday is a good time to talk to mentors, friends or industry experts about some of the interesting plans you’re coming up with.

"
10588,2 march 2017,pisces,"Rage against the machine? You could be in one heck of a rebellious mood, courtesy of an epic Jupiter-Uranus smackdown. If you perceive that anything or anyone is holding you back—your job, a lover, society, your parents, the system—chances are you’ll be ready to bolt. However, don’t make any quick decisions under this aspect. Venus retrogrades this weekend in your sign, giving you four weeks to ponder your next move.

"
10589,3 march 2017,pisces,"Is it time to add to the tribe? A happy Moon-Pluto aspect encourages you to reach out to some new folks and make their acquaintance. Over the next week a number of fresh contacts can be made in all areas of your life. You never know where these connections might take you. Getting introduced to your future spouse, hearing about a job opening or enjoying the company of close confidantes are all possible.

"
10590,4 march 2017,pisces,"Keep a close eye on expenses over the next four weeks as Venus retrogrades today in your income sector. If a major expense can wait, then hold off, as your money situation could not be as robust as you’d like. Naturally this includes luxury items as our gal Venus is fond of swag. Do you share your finances with someone else? All the more reason to be careful as disagreements may arise about spending and saving. That said, Monday is a good day to interview or ask for a raise.

10591,5 march 2017,pisces,"Benjamin Franklin wants to be your new BFF, Pisces. He wants to get real close to you–like in your wallet. Gotta love it when the cosmos is trying to dump more money in your lap, and that’s what’s happening today with a highly motivating Mars-Saturn trine. Want to see more green? Then do what’s necessary: update your resume, ask for a raise, start the business.

"
10592,6 march 2017,pisces,"Venus may have gone retrograde in your house of feeling safe and secure, but that doesn’t mean that you should suffer in silence. Heck no! As a matter of fact today is the perfect time to speak up and let others know how you feel. If you need to bounce some ideas off a friend, do so on Wednesday or Thursday, optimal days for receiving sound advice.

10593,7 march 2017,pisces,"Group activities can pick up steam this week, such as planning a family reunion or wedding, a girls-only trip to Vegas or a departmental project at the office.

It’s a great time to get involved in a charity or volunteer effort, as Pluto is active in your humanitarian eleventh house. Find an exercise buddy, start a book club, hook up with an accountability partner, become a soccer coach. The more you give of yourself the more you’ll get back. It’s a universal law.

10595,9 march 2017,pisces,"Go loud and proud or go home, Pisces. Megawatt (and megamouth) Mars moves into your talkative house of expression today, its first visit here in two years. This is one of your best times all year to socialize (for fun as well as for making profitable new connections), self promote, blog, take classes, teach, write or get involved in the graphic arts. With so much planetary action bubbling away in your income sector, you might want to think about how to bring home more cash. It’s not going to land on your doorstep, so use this Martian influence to go out there and earn it.

"
10596,10 march 2017,pisces,"Switch up the way you communicate with bosses, clients and colleagues, Pisces. Aim for a more congenial tone. No one is accusing you of being difficult or arrogant, however. Just play the diplomat, as this role will help you out more in the months ahead than playing the lone wolf card. With the Sun about to enter your income sector you need to work well with other people.

"
10597,11 march 2017,pisces,"The smart Pisces makes an attempt to work out financial or personality issues with a partner today (and that includes business alliances). Don’t let wishful thinking blind you to the realities of your budget, expenses or emotional state. Otherwise the full moon in Virgo tomorrows bring them to a rolling boil. From your chart it appears that you’re the one who’s going to have to play the heavy.

"
10598,12 march 2017,pisces,"Moving closer, or further apart? Today’s full moon in your commitment sector can be a game-changer. If a romance has been less than fulfilling you may decide to move on. On the other hand, this lunation could increase your resolve to find common ground and become even more secure. One thing that you’re NOT going to want is someone else calling the shots. Advocate for yourself.

Something could happen today that will make this clear! You also need to create a cushion for larger projects that may require more cash than you had planned. Today’s aspects tell you to create a nice cushion.

"
10601,15 march 2017,pisces,"It’s a good day to clear the air with a loved one, and to put an end to a drama or discussion that has been going on for far too long. There won’t be any tears or screaming necessary, just a calm but authoritative manner on your part. Try to maintain this aura as the week continues, as it looks like colleagues and even bosses may need to be set straight.

"
10602,16 march 2017,pisces,"Thinking about chucking it all and moving into a beach shack somewhere? Or maybe you’re day dreaming about getting out of the rat race and following an entrepreneurial dream. Or finding Mr. Right and sailing off into the sunset. No problem, folks! Just be aware that a tough aspect tomorrow could bring resistance to your ideas. That, however, doesn’t mean that they won’t work.

"
10603,17 march 2017,pisces,"Just how skilled are you, Pisces? As a mother, or a student, or as an employee? Regardless of the role you play, there is room for improvement in all areas of our lives. Take an honest assessment. With disciplined Saturn in your most ambitious sector, you can definitely make headway, provided you buckle down and develop the necessary skills.

"
10604,18 march 2017,pisces,"Ahh, the sweet smell of newly minted greenbacks. The crisp sound they make as you stack them and place a few Benjamins in your wallet. Get ready to see more green, Pisces, and it ain’t because spring is coming. The Sun is just about to enter your income sector on Monday, but the fun really begins today. Profitable Venus holds a conversation with shrewd Mercury about how to increase your bottom line. Start coming up with a plan.

"
10605,19 march 2017,pisces,"You can start making some serious coin once the Sun enters Aries tomorrow, but first you need to figure out a game plan. Strict Saturn is active today, telling you to put aside emotions and just go with the facts. Forget what other people around you say and what they want. In the weeks ahead others will try to pull you off course. Are they worth it?

"
10606,20 march 2017,pisces,"Hopefully you used the energy of your birthday season to figure out your next moves. Now that the Sun is in Aries, it’s time to press forward with them, which will require some smart new habits and routines. Aries is your second house of practicality and stability, which includes financial strength. This is your best time all year to land a new job, raise or revenue stream for your business. But hustle now before the April retrogrades (four of them!) begin.

"
10607,22 march 2017,pisces,"“It’s not my job!” Get ready for that attitude over the next few days as others slack or refuse to conform. Likewise, people may not agree on the direction a project should be heading in. You’ll bee able to get them on track by next Tuesday.

"
10608,23 march 2017,pisces,"You have a vision as to where you’re going. More than that, you have a plan. Unfortunately, you may face resistance to your dreams today and tomorrow as intelligent Mercury squares stubborn Pluto. Someone may try to pull rank or try to convince you that your ideas aren’t worth pursuing. Please! You know better than that. As a matter of fact, the new moon next Tuesday is perfect for gaining more traction. Onward and upward.

"
10609,24 march 2017,pisces,"Your mind should be on money, thanks to intelligent Mercury in your income and savings sector. This is one of your best years in over a decade to build a strong financial portfolio, but the planets warn that you need to get real about debt, retirement accounts and benefits packages. There’s no point in earning more if you don’t have a solid plan for creating wealth. Fortunately next week’s new moon will help you develop some solid, practical habits and solutions.

"
10610,25 march 2017,pisces,"No one likes feeling insecure when it comes to love, their job status or their financial situation. Nor do they enjoy feelings of low self-worth. Well, if you’re feeling that way change can start right now, thanks to a fortuitous meeting of Venus and the Sun. New opportunities to expand your income and to feel better about romance will come your way over the next six months, right after Tuesday’s new moon in Aries.

"
10611,26 march 2017,pisces,"Leave an hour or so free today, Pisces, as the universe is getting ready to inspire you. Brilliant money-making ideas could come your way: an invention, an idea for a new company, a place to send your resume, a different field to enter. Your previous ideas of what you are capable of are changing. It’s time to take a bigger bite out of life! Start thinking and strategizing.

"
10612,27 march 2017,pisces,"“If you don’t ask, you don’t get.” Ever hear that saying? It applies to you this week, Pisces, so repeat it until it sinks in! Assertive Mars in your chatty third house is encouraging you to speak up for yourself. No need to be angry or dictatorial, though, with dreamy Neptune in your house of self-image. You can make your point with ease and politeness.

"
10613,28 march 2017,pisces,"The cosmos blesses each sign with one new moon a year in the income sector, and today is your lucky day, Pisces. Over the next few months you could land a promotion, raise or new job. Self-employed Pisceans could dream up a new revenue stream or sign on some profitable clients. Helping matters is the nearby presence of Venus, smoothing over bumps on the journey ahead and greasing the wheels of making connections with influential people.

"
10614,29 march 2017,pisces,"Long range goals and dreams get a cosmic boost from the meeting of intelligent Mercury and stable Saturn. This is an excellent week to shop for a new job, make presentations to big shots, ask the boss for a raise or develop a new income stream for your business. The deals you negotiate have long term ramifications, so take your time and make the right decisions.

"
10615,30 march 2017,pisces,"An energetic Moon-Mars connection could turn you into a motor mouth, which is not a good idea under current planetary conditions. You run the risk of revealing too much. This includes online conversations and social media posts, so think before you hit “send”. People may be pushing your buttons, so it could be tempting to respond or vent to someone else. Don’t go there.

"
10616,31 march 2017,pisces,"Boosting your income is the goal of the cosmos, thanks to Mars, the Sun, a recent new moon, and Uranus all packed into your second house of earnings and saving cash. And today strategic Mercury zips into your communications sector, a super placement for negotiating, holding meetings and self-promotion. Hustle now, before the messenger planet goes retrograde on April 9th.

"
10617,1 april 2017,pisces,"Got something to say or express? Then make haste, Pisces. Verbal Mercury enters your communication sector today but goes retrograde on the 9th. As a result, negotiate with clients, try to settle that argument with your brother, e-mail your resume to a decision maker, and finish your thesis. The retro period runs from the 9th til the 18th–not a long time, but long enough to slow things down.

"
10618,2 april 2017,pisces,"Time for a personal rewrite or makeover? If you’re itching to start afresh–with a new attitude, look or occupation–then today’s retrograde movement of Venus into your sign is just the ticket. You can really have a lot of fun with this, especially considering that next week’s full moon falls in your house of passion and libido. It may be time for a sexier, more confident you to be strutting down the street!

"
10619,3 april 2017,pisces,"If you’ve been feeling like you want to cut loose from responsibility so that you can enjoy the lighter side of life, then by all means do so. A frisky Moon-Neptune trine will make you amorous, adventurous and maybe even a tad dangerous! (In a good way, that is.) Enjoy this energy, as by Thursday you’ll have to deal with more pragmatic matters.

"
10620,4 april 2017,pisces,"Something might happen that will make you feel unsettled about love. If you’re looking for guarantees or a steady calm pace, that may be elusive over the next week. The full moon in Libra next week will bring things to a head, so get ready to hold some serious conversations.

"
10621,5 april 2017,pisces,"Don’t become too influenced by the opinions of other people. Some of them may mean well, but they don’t know you as much as you know yourself. There is deep wisdom within–seek it, nurture it and work with it. Mentors have their place but in the long run it all comes down to you.

"
10622,6 april 2017,pisces,"Do you really want what you’re going after? Sometimes we become so fixated on a plan or goal that we don’t realize that we’ve outgrown it. Now that Saturn is retrograde in your tenth house of ambition it’s time to take a second look at your plans. You may need to conduct research, talk to mentors or become more skilled . Slowing down and taking a review could end up being one of the smartest things you can do in 2017.

"
10623,7 april 2017,pisces,"With the mighty Sun in your income sector you’re probably anxious to earn more. Maybe too  anxious! A problematic Sun-Jupiter aspect could find you creating unrealistic plans for the future when it comes to your career, company or savings plan. A bank may not come through with a loan, people could back out of a project or revenues could take longer to appear than you might expect. Take all of this into consideration as you make future plans.

"
10624,8 april 2017,pisces,"You may need to seize the reins when it comes to any kind of group activity or team effort—unless, of course, you want to get run over by its members. Power struggles may erupt—within a family, a volunteer organization, a committee at work or even your friends. You may not want to be the group leader, but it’s also not wise to stand along the sidelines hoping that everything will just work out. It won’t, so exert some of your influence without getting in too deep.

"
10625,9 april 2017,pisces,"Zip your lips! Chatty Mercury retrogrades in your communication sector, so the opportunity for screw-ups is high: sending a snarky e-mail about your boss to  your boss by mistake. Revealing a confidence (yours or someone else’s) when it should have remained quiet. Launching a sales campaign before all the kinks have been worked out. But the good thing is that you can use this energy to polish up your skills, such as public speaking, blogging or Photoshop. This period ends on the 20th, so plan accordingly.

"
10626,10 april 2017,pisces,"Try to kiss and make up with people you’ve been at odds with recently, even if they have wronged you. Part of the problem is that Venus has been retrograde in your self-image sector, perhaps making you feel insecure. That’s about to change when the golden planet moves direct this coming Saturday. You’ll be feeling better in no time.

"
10627,11 april 2017,pisces,"Tonight’s full moon is superb for kicking off a prosperous new chapter with your finances and career, so by all means start hustling. But choose your friends, colleagues and clients carefully as Pluto is in a tough spot. You will need the assistance of others as you forge ahead, but you can still be choosy. Make sure you know who you’re dealing with.

"
10628,12 april 2017,pisces,"You could use a new challenge, Pisces, something that shows off your talent and makes you feel good about yourself again. Something might present itself over the next few days that fits this bill. Not only that, some fresh opportunities for making more money could suddenly appear, so keep your eyes and ears open.

"
10629,13 april 2017,pisces,"Finding a solution or compromise should be easier than usual with a helpful Moon-Pluto aspect. From your chart it appears that you need to lay down some rules with the people in your world, otherwise they’ll run you ragged. Progress can be made without a lot of drama and screaming–today, anyhow! Tomorrow is another story.

"
10630,14 april 2017,pisces,"You may becoming increasingly fed up with a boss, client or co-workers, but blasting them back to the Stone Age may not be your smartest move right now. With maverick Uranus acting up today, someone may pull a stunt that will throw you off your game. Keep calm and carry on. When Venus resumes direct motion in you sign tomorrow, it will be your show, not their’s.

"
10631,15 april 2017,pisces,"Damn, you look good. And you should feel good too. Glamorous Venus has just gone direct in your first house of image and self-esteem, wrapping up a six-week retro period that may have made you feel less than sexy and attractive. Your thinking should become clearer and as a result, the path ahead is a straight one. March on, Pisces!

"
10632,16 april 2017,pisces,"Super day to talk things over with your honey–or shop for a new one if you’re in the market! A sweet Mars-Venus aspect is just the ticket for romance. Plan a three day weekend sometime soon with your amour. Flirt outrageously with that potential new mate. It’s all about living in the moment, so get out there and enjoy life.

"
10633,17 april 2017,pisces,"If there was ever a day to make a smoking hot impression on others, it’s today, Pisces! The two most stable and influential orbs in the solar system form a harmonious trine: the Sun and Saturn. It’s a smart time to ask for the job, the raise, the order or the contract. Research new opportunities and figure out how you can develop more influence within  your industry.

"
10634,18 april 2017,pisces,"Don’t let a friend or colleague strong arm you into doing something that meets their agenda. They may not be above preying on your emotions to get what they want, so stand firm. With the Sun entering your communications sector tomorrow you’ll be in a great position to let people know what’s on your mind, and the expectations you have of them.

"
10635,19 april 2017,pisces,"Your life is about to become a heck of a lot more social now that the Sun is in your house of buzzing around the neighborhood, hanging out with friends and talking up a storm. Just be careful what you post online as Pluto is about to retrograde in your technology sector. Likewise, if you’re not sure that a friend can keep a confidence then zip your lips. Otherwise you can enjoy a sparkling time ahead, especially with family and loved ones.

"
10636,20 april 2017,pisces,"You’ll be seeking security over the next few weeks now that Mercury is retrograde, and one of the places you’ll be seeking it is in your personal relationships. This includes friends and business contacts as well as a lover. Are you all on the same page? Is anyone on a power trip, trying to gain control over a relationship or group activity? If they are, you’re not going to be quiet about it. Nor should you. Wait till the new moon on the 26th to let them know what you think.

"
10637,21 april 2017,pisces,"Feeling emo? It’s a strong possibility in the weeks ahead as red hot Mars is now in your sector of comfort and security, stirring things up. Family dramas may come to the fore along with relationship issues, so you might want to start a mindfulness meditation practice! Mercury just went retro in another sector that deals with security so between now and May 3rd you may feel out of sorts, maybe even fearful of where things are heading. Just remember that fears are not always the same as reality, and that Mercury will resume direct motion on May 3rd.

"
10638,22 april 2017,pisces,"Feeling lazy and languorous? Can’t think of anything better to do than to kick back and relax? You know, breakfast in bed, binge watching Netflix, or a nice long juicy gossip session with a friend? Sorry! Get-real Saturn warns that you better get some work done around the house or at the office. Oh, and he’s doing the same next week, so get ready to be productive.

"
10639,23 april 2017,pisces,"They say that loving yourself is the greatest love of all. While some folks may think that this sounds egotistical, it’ s really not. This is about self-esteem and being proud of the person you’ve become, and a happy Moon-Venus aspect will start putting a smile on your face. Things get even better next Friday when Venus glides into your house of dignity.

"
10640,24 april 2017,pisces,"Back to the drawing board! Both Mercury and Saturn are retrograde in sectors that deal with your career and making more money, but today they form a terrific aspect. Revise your resume, analyze past revenues and cash flow, make follow up phone calls to prospects, finish up old projects and strategize for the near future. Once Wednesday’s new moon comes around you should be in heavy self-promotion mode.

"
10641,25 april 2017,pisces,"There are good surprises when it comes to money and bad surprises. We never have to prepare ourselves for the good ones though, do we? But that’s what the cosmos has on offer for you today, some kind of happy event which can improve your cash flow. Maybe you hear about a job opening at another company. Perhaps you hit upon an idea for a product you could patent, or a company to start. This energy lasts for several weeks so don’t waste it.

"
10642,26 april 2017,pisces,"Your career can take flight as a number of positive aspects over the next few days puts your ambitions in focus. First, an energetic Uranus-Saturn trine could bring about a sudden (but profitable) change: a job offer, promotion or landing a new client. Then a new moon occurs today in your house of strategizing and negotiating, helping you connect with others to pursue a common goal. Then on Friday Venus glides into your income sector. Gotta love it! But nothing will happen unless you hustle, so get moving.

"
10643,27 april 2017,pisces,"People in high places might be willing to help you but you’re going to have to make the first move. A sparkling Moon-Pluto trine helps you make the right connections, say the best words and think of the savviest strategy. This isn’t a one-day deal, however; keep at it over the next three weeks as this is one of your best times all year to make progress.

"
10644,28 april 2017,pisces,"Romantic relationships can now become more grounded, thanks to Venus entering the stable second house. Try to establish more of a “date night” routine with your lover. Singles, this aspect encourages you to find a serious partner, not some fly-by-night fling. All Pisces are going to be looking fro more financial stability with this aspect, whether it’s on your own or with joint assets.

"
10645,29 april 2017,pisces,"With so much planetary activity pushing you to achieve your ambitions, you may be neglecting some of the people around you—or even yourself. Find a balance this weekend between your personal life and your goals. Venus just entered your income sector, so the opportunity to earn more is high. But you need to keep others happy and recharge your batteries as well.

"
10646,30 april 2017,pisces,"Get in touch with your inner Warhol! Or Bon Jovi, Jagger, Kahlo, Pollock, Da Vinci……. That’s because the passionate Moon is in the most creative part of your chart this weekend, telling you to schedule more hobby time. And if that means signing up for a class you should do that too. Life’s too short to always be using the left side of your brain.

"
10647,1 may 2017,pisces,"Swag alert! Keep your wallet locked up tight as you could be tempted to splurge on luxury items or things that simply aren’t necessary right now. Logical Mercury is retrograde in your spending and savings sector, pointing out your weaknesses when it comes to fiscal planning. Stick to purchasing the essentials.

"
10648,2 may 2017,pisces,"With aggressive Mars tearing through your domestic sector, you may be hell bent on turning your home into a castle, or your yard into a green paradise. Today the Moon is in the most efficient part of your chart, so don’t be surprised if a sudden burst of inspiration hits you to get organized. Mercury has been retrograde in your habits sector for the past few weeks, asking you to streamline and develop better routines.

"
10649,3 may 2017,pisces,"Gotta love it—Mercury resumes direct motion in your income sector, loosening up logjams that may have been preventing you from earning more. The Sun and inspirational Neptune also form a terrific aspect in your houses of self-promotion, branding and image. Don’t waste this opportunity—let the world know that you’ve got the goods.

"
10650,4 may 2017,pisces,"You’re in a take-charge mood these days, which is a good thing. But it would still be smart to get advice from other people. Don’t worry, you won’t have to do everything they suggest. Pick and choose from the pieces of information you receive and put the most practical ones in place.

"
10651,5 may 2017,pisces,"Need to revisit an issue with someone close? Then get on it. Now that the Sun is in the most verbal part of your chart you can finally say what’s been on your mind, even if you were reluctant to say your piece before this. Jupiter is retrograding through one of the most emotional parts of your chart, helping you come to grips with deep seated feelings. Let them out.

"
10652,6 may 2017,pisces,"What you want and what others want from you seem to be two separate things this weekend, Pisces. You’re feeling rather domineering with strict Saturn in your authoritative tenth house, but that’s not the same thing as being dictatorial. Don’t back down. People around you may resort to guilt or other manipulative techniques, but it’s not your karma to kowtow to everyone.

"
10653,7 may 2017,pisces,"Feeling good about yourself is a heck of lot easier when the Moon and abundant Jupiter are embracing, and that’s what they’re doing today Pisces! Not only that glamorous Neptune turns up the heat in your self-image sector, advising a bit of a makeover. What are you waiting for? This week’s full moon falls in your house of taking risks!

"
10654,8 may 2017,pisces,"Intelligent, logical Mercury is transiting through one of the most practical parts of your chart, demanding that you establish and stick to good habits. The problem is that your more emotional side just wants to play. Find a balance and figure out how to do both! The full moon on Wednesday can take you to some exciting new places in life, but you’ll need to work to get there.

"
10655,9 may 2017,pisces,"Need a favor? Want to be rubbing elbows with the right kind of people? Then get out there and start mingling, as a terrific Sun-Pluto trine can help you make some scintillating new connections. Tomorrow’s full moon adds rocket boosters to this scene, so keep up the momentum over the next few weeks.

"
10656,10 may 2017,pisces,"Feel like packing your bags and heading off on an adventure? Blame it on the full moon in Scorpio, which is stirring up wanderlust and the desire to learn more about the world—and to experience more too. Hiding in the shadows is not where you’re coming from these days. Better yet is that your social life is about to pick up steam as Pluto in your networking sector is trying to bring new faces into your life. This could be in love, business, volunteer work, the neighborhood or friendship. You might even hear some good news about a raise or an offer of employment, so get ready for some big changes.

"
10657,11 may 2017,pisces,"Don’t kid yourself about an emotional issue, Pisces. A difficult Mars-Neptune aspect could find you putting on the rose colored glasses. Placing someone on a pedestal, pretending that a problem doesn’t exist, or allowing someone to use guilt as part of their agenda is all a possibility today. But you have other planets in some “get real” sectors trying to bring not only logic your way, but a sense of authority—and dignity.

"
10658,12 may 2017,pisces,"There’s an old Etta James song that goes like this: “I want a Sunday kind of love..a love to last past Saturday night. And I’d like to know it’s more than love at first sight. I want a Sunday  kind of love.” This song popped into my mind as I started to write your daily scope. With desirous Mars in your sector of nesting, and abundant Jupiter in your house of intimacy and bonding, you want a lover to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon with, someone who will always be there.

"
10659,13 may 2017,pisces,"Fear can actually be helpful at times, as it keeps us from going where angels fear to tread. But when it paralyzes us unnecessarily you have to be aware what it’s doing to you. Fortunately subterranean Pluto is in a good spot, helping you recognize your blind spots and the places where worry and fear sneak in and take over. If there has been something that you’ve wanted to do for some time now, release the brakes.

"
10660,14 may 2017,pisces,"Just how far do you want to go when it comes to sharing your deepest thoughts with someone close? Considering that Mercury is just about to enter the chattiest part of your chart you could become quite verbal. But words may stick in your throat when you try to communicate with a lover or good friend. Fortunately subterranean Pluto is on the job, helping you pinpoint the right way to go about it.

"
10661,15 may 2017,pisces,"A lot has been said about manifesting, and today’s cosmic activity recommends that you “send it out to the universe”, “it” being the dreams you hold dear. But this isn’t some metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. By all means talk to people, let them know what you’re trying to attain and search for mentors who can help you along the way. But creating a vision board is a terrific visual reminder of what you’re aiming for.

"
10662,16 may 2017,pisces,"Witty banter, story telling, chatting people up, cocktails and brunches—who wants in on this scene? Yeah, I thought so. And this is what you can enjoy, Pisces, now that convivial Mercury is in your social third house through June 6th. Of course, you can use this energy for talking to (and impressing) potential bosses and clients. This is one of your best times all year for strategizing and schmoozing. Use it wisely.

"
10663,17 may 2017,pisces,"If you’re seeking an answer to a problem the best place to look is within. Your own wisdom can provide you with the guidance you need, assuming that you can still your mind long enough to tap into the source. Meditate, take a walk in nature, or keep a dream journal. You’re craving more comfort and guarantees these days: this is an excellent way to find it.

"
10664,18 may 2017,pisces,"Due diligence! Dig deep, Pisces, especially if you’re on the verge of signing some important financial documents— for a mortgage, car loan, line of credit, or entering into a business partnership. The same holds true for getting involved in passive income streams, network marketing or any kind of commission-based earnings. There’s some airy-fairy thinking going on courtesy of the two profits planets, Venus and Jupiter, not being grounded today. Don’t go with your gut; operate with logic.

"
10665,19 may 2017,pisces,"A big boost in earnings could come your way thanks to a rare Uranus-Saturn trine, an event that will repeat in November. Uranus is the genius planet, the orb of spontaneity, so you could experience a “Eureka!” moment in which you stumble upon a hot new income stream or job opening. There’s a saying: “do things the same way you’ve always done them and you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.” It’s time to think out of the box.

"
10666,20 may 2017,pisces,"Feeling like nesting at home? Ready to redecorate, relax and work in the garden? That could be the case now that the Sun is in your domestic fourth house. Family issues can get cleared up over the next four weeks. A pregnancy might occur, couples could move in together and engagements are quite possible! But don’t get too pushy about making all of this happen, a possibility with assertive Mars in the same part of the sky. Fortunately chatty Mercury is in your house of communication, making it far easier to talk things over intelligently and come to a drama-free agreement.

"
10667,21 may 2017,pisces,"Now that the Sun is in your domestic sector you should be focused on having a clean, organized and relaxing place to come home to at the end of each day. And if that means setting certain people straight about their responsibilities, like getting the chores done, so be it. They also need to know that you want to live in a drama-free environment, so they’ll need to change their attitude along with their habits.

"
10668,22 may 2017,pisces,"You want guarantees and you want them now, and today is a good day to demand them. Nicely, that is. Venus is in your house of security, and as she sidles up to the Moon your emotions could rise. Whether you’re looking for an answer in love, money or a family matter, don’t get carried away with drama and ultimatums. You can get the answers you’re looking for with honey on your tongue rather than vinegar.

"
10669,23 may 2017,pisces,"Who’s the boss in your private life? If your kids are running you into the ground, a spouse is on a power trip or family members are butting in too much, you’ll be ready to mutiny by the 29th. That’s when stern Saturn opposes Mars in the heavens, one heck of a tough aspect. A word to the wise Pisces: lay down the law now before then, or things will get ugly.

"
10670,24 may 2017,pisces,"You certainly can enjoy some good times ahead with friends or business colleagues. But you have to make sure that everyone knows their roles within a team effort, not to mention due dates, scheduling and so on. If there are any malcontents within your circle it may be time to let them go. Tomorrow’s new moon in Gemini is all about you feeling comfortable, and that includes your relationships with others.

"
10671,25 may 2017,pisces,"There are only 24 hours in a day, something that you would be wise to remember, Pisces! And that means that you can’t do it all. Today’s new moon recommends spending more quality time at home with your family, a lover or simply yourself. If that means cutting back on your work day so be it. Maybe some big goals need to be scaled back or given a different completion date, one that’s further out in the future.

If working out and becoming more fit will make you feel better about yourself, then this is a good time to start a diet and exercise plan. It’s not your destiny to live with an achey, flabby body!

"
10673,27 may 2017,pisces,"A sudden burst of inspiration might hit you to get your home environment pulled together. And the good thing about getting one area of your life cleaned up is that it often leads to momentum in other areas. Get things rolling this weekend and get ready to savor the results.

"
10674,28 may 2017,pisces,"What did Dorothy learn in The Wizard of Oz?  Plenty, but one of the biggest messages was that you don’t have to travel far to learn about life. Sometimes the greatest lessons are those that take place right in your back yard, and that’s what the cosmos is telling you, Pisces.

"
10675,29 may 2017,pisces,"Take a deep breath and count to ten! A Saturn-Mars faceoff could bring out the worst in family members and  work colleagues over the next few days. People will be wearing their bossy pants and you will be in no mood for it, especially if you feel that your security is threatened in any way. The good news is that you’re like the little piggy with the brick house, telling the big bad wolf that he can huff and puff all he wants….but you won’t be backing down. Let ’em turn tail and run away.

"
10676,30 may 2017,pisces,"Getting a handle on household expenses becomes easier with a helpful Mars-Uranus aspect. You may end up making a quick decision to cut out some expenses that are simply not necessary. Likewise, an idea for a new income stream could pop into your head. Tomorrow’s a great day to run some of these ideas past others who can give you feedback.

"
10677,31 may 2017,pisces,"You may be in the spotlight over the next few days, so make sure that you’re polished and have your act together. That won’t be too hard with so many planets making you look like a winner. If you need the advice of someone older or wiser, reach out and make that contact.

"
10678,1 june 2017,pisces,"Need to make a big ask? Then go for it! Charismatic Venus will put the right words in your mouth. Decision makers may actually be more amenable to your requests than you’d might expect, so don’t hold back. Mature Saturn is by your side, helping you make new arrangements that will stand the test of time.

"
10679,1 june 2016,pisces,"Who’s pulling the strings at home? That question may be on your mind as the Sun squares Neptune, creating confusion and perhaps even drama. You may be drawing a line in the sand with a family member, whether it’s a spouse, parent, in-law or child. If you feel that others have been taking you for granted, chances are you’re going to be vocal about it.

"
10680,2 june 2017,pisces,"You’re entering into a brave new phase in which you won’t be hesitant to speak your mind. This isn’t just about sharing your opinions: it’s about showing the world the passion that’s driving you forward. Once Mars rolls into Cancer on Sunday, you’ll be be unstoppable as your skill level increases daily.

"
10681,2 june 2016,pisces,"Reach out and touch someone! It’s a wonderful day to express your thoughts and emotions to someone you care about, whether it’s a child, family member or loved one. This is especially true if you’ve been harboring resentment, guilt or anger. The North Node of the Moon is active, which means that old feelings of worthlessness simply don’t belong in your psyche any more. You deserve to be happy, Pisces, we all do. But sometimes to you have to ask for it.

"
10682,3 june 2017,pisces,"“I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more!” is a famous line from the 1976 movie Network, and it really applies to you today Pisces. Not the mad part though. The part about not wanting to settle for life’s table scraps. You’re worth more and you know it, and a rockin’ conjunction between Venus and Uranus will drive that point home.

"
10683,4 june 2017,pisces,"Your relationships with loved ones becomes the focus over the next two months as Mars glides into your house of romance and children today. Schedule date nights with your spouse. Clear out time on your calendar just for your kids or grandkids. This also happens to be the sector of enjoying life, creativity and sports, so you  need the time to indulge in hobbies and interests that stir your soul.

"
10684,5 june 2017,pisces,"Touchy! That’s how you may feel today as the Sun squares Neptune. Your emotions will be operating at full throttle, not a good situation if you have any major decisions to make. Wait until Friday’s full moon in Sagittarius before you make up your mind. This lunation occurs in your rational house of authority, so you’ll be in a much better place.

"
10685,6 june 2017,pisces,"This is not time to hide your light under a bushel. Venus enters your communication sector today, recommending that you promote yourself!

Fortunately smooth talking and logical Mercury moves into your domestic sector today, a blessing for holding calm discussions with loved ones.

"
10687,8 june 2017,pisces,"Trying to put aside more cash in investments and build a more comfortable nest egg? A helpful Jupiter-Neptune aspect provides the inspiration you need to get moving. Fortunately for you, tomorrow’s full moon falls in your house of ambition— the planets are lining up nicely. Your skills may be far worth than you’re settling for, which means that you shouldn’t sell yourself short. If you want to earn more you may need to learn more, so keep that in mind.

"
10688,9 june 2017,pisces,"Ready for more responsibility? The planets seem to think so! The full moon takes place in your career sector, which also governs other big goals of yours. You could be making a big decision over the next few weeks, something with long lasting implications.

"

If you’ve been unsure as to which direction to head in, clarity will return. Over the next few months you’re going to start to feel as though you have more control over your life, a positive feeling. Waiting for other people to make up their minds won’t be a part of your repertoire.

"
10690,11 june 2017,pisces,"Why are you letting others define who you are? If this continues your self-esteem will take a hit. Start living by your own rules, Pisces. When Neptune retrogrades this Friday you’ll have plenty of time for self analysis and making changes. You deserve dignity.

"
10691,12 june 2017,pisces,"Cut through any dramas that have been going on around you. With insightful Mercury in a good angle, you can get people back on track, behaving politely instead of being at war. You may need to lay down the law but so be it. Your peace of mind is worth it.

"
10692,13 june 2017,pisces,"No one knows how to push your buttons like family, as they say, and today that adage is true. You’re feeling a bit thin skinned these days, Pisces, and actually just about anyone could be working your nerves. Pull away for an hour or two and do some thinking. Is the reason you feel so tense due to all of the obligations you have? If so, it’s time to make some changes.

"
10693,14 june 2017,pisces,"Get quiet today and dig into your work or the projects that are important to you. Sometimes we just need to shut the world out for a few hours in order for true inspiration to hit us, and that’s the message in the stars for you today. Your family or other loved ones may be tugging at your sleeve, but patiently let them know that you need some space.

"
10694,15 june 2017,pisces,"Duty calls, but you’re not too interested in responding. A harsh Sun-Saturn aspect pits your personal need for downtime against a demanding boss, client, or tasks that are clamoring for attention. Is it burnout? Too many long hours spent at the office or on other responsibilities? This energy repeats again on Sunday, so set some boundaries if need be.

"
10695,16 june 2017,pisces,"Neptune, your ruler, begins its usual retrograde in Pisces from now through late November. As a result you may become more reflective, especially about important plans or dreams for the future. But what’s wrong with that? Sometimes we need a quiet time for adjustments to be made. Just make sure that you don’t start questioning your talent or personality. You have what it takes, so be proud!


"
10696,17 june 2017,pisces,"The cosmos is sending mixed messages, Pisces! On the one hand, Neptune in retrograde is telling you to go within and be reflective. But the friendly Sun and chatty Mercury are getting ready to enter your fifth house of fun, frolic and flirting. What to do? Hmmmm….book some alone time while you’re planning the next escapade, perhaps!

"
10697,18 june 2017,pisces,"Making changes on the home front could happen more quickly than you realize, Pisces. You may need to put people on notice that you have certain expectations, or set boundaries to keep people from annoying the living daylights out of you. But so be it. Your peace of mind is worth it.

"
10698,19 june 2017,pisces,"Are your heart and your head working at cross purposes, Pisces? It sure seems that way from your chart. It’s emotions versus logic as Mercury and Saturn stare each other down across the heavens. Fortunately this cosmic storm passes quickly and by midweek the atmosphere has changed. (Just so you know….it looks like the heart wins!)

"
10699,20 june 2017,pisces,"Creating more structure in your home environment becomes easier with a productive Mercury-Uranus aspect. There’s something to be said for a smooth-running household, even if you live by yourself. Take care of as many things as you can today, or create some new routines that you’ll initiate soon. Tomorrow the Sun enters the most fun-loving part of your chart, and honestly you may not be too motivated!

"
10700,21 june 2017,pisces,"Lucky you! The Sun and convivial Mercury enter your fifth house of fun and flirting, to be followed by a new moon in this sector on the weekend. It’s time to stop and smell the flowers—and the lattes, prosecco and veal marsala. It’s time to take in a movie with a big tub of buttered popcorn, not to mention heading to the beach and soaking up the rays. While you’re at it, schedule brunches with the girls and special date nights with your sweetie. Single? This is one of your best times all year to meet someone new.

"
10701,22 june 2017,pisces,"The ancients considered everything when they created the 12 house system in astrology, including our hobbies, the sports we play and the kind of entertainment venues we enjoy. These fall under the fifth house, which for you is now lit up like a Christmas tree. So pick up your paint brushes, golf clubs or go to a museum. Life’s too short to be working all the time.


"
10702,23 june 2017,pisces,"The stereotype of the airhead artist is just that–a stereotype. So is the one about the corporate people who are all facts and figures. The reality is that we all have a creative side and a more structured one. Your job today is to align the two.

"
10703,24 june 2017,pisces,"The people in your world are about to become a lot more important to you, thanks to the new moon in one of the most social and fun-loving parts of your chart. Networking is the order of the day, whether you do so to find new love, a job, or just to create new bonds with like-minded people. It’s also a great time to become more civic minded and get involved in your local happenings.

"
10704,25 june 2017,pisces,"Feel like taking a risk in love? Or maybe you’re simply ready to live a more authentic life. That’s because your ruler, Neptune, is active in your chart, encouraging you to live a far more colorful existence. The question is this–do you have the guts to pursue it?

10705,26 june 2017,pisces,"It’s time to take a chance, Pisces–on yourself! A magnificent Mars-Neptune trine tells you to stop putting yourself down and instead, to focus on latent talents that may be buried within you. Why the hell are you holding back? Please! By the way, this energy isn’t going away anytime soon, so step out of the shadows and into the limelight.

"
10706,27 june 2017,pisces,"Your head and your heart will work together today in perfect sync, so have faith that you’re heading in the right direction.

"
10707,27 june 2016,pisces,"The planets are lining up in your romance houses, smoothing the way ahead for a serious commitment. Neptune will help you see the big picture in romance as you release petty concerns; communicative Mercury enters your house of love, enabling you to speak with ease, and Mars finally goes direct in your blue-skies-ahead house of expansion. Single? The cosmos hasn’t forgotten you. Mars suggests that you think outside the box when it comes to new love.

"
10708,28 june 2017,pisces,"Let your freak flag fly, Pisces! There’s no holding back as a Mars-Mercury aspect encourages you to be as bold and dramatic as you please. Dye your hair red, learn to speak French, toss out those old grandma underpants and buy some sexy lingerie, or basically dare to be different. The world is your oyster, so seize the moment.

"
10709,28 june 2016,pisces,"Something may happen today that will find you questioning the practicality of a major goal or plan. It’s possible that you may have to scale back your plans a bit, primarily due to financial reasons. It’s also crucial to examine the protocols, routines or flow of events that need to take place in order for this plan to work. Do that, and you stand an excellent chance of success.

"
10710,29 june 2017,pisces,"Despite your best efforts to play nice with others, they may not be willing to play nice back. Or maybe they’re moody, withdrawn or uncooperative. This is more about them than you, so let it slide. You have so much planetary activity in your frisky house of having fun that all you should be worrying about is your next adventure.

"
10711,29 june 2016,pisces,"That proverbial light bulb will be going off above your head today, Pisces, as the cosmos illuminates your mind with a bright idea. It may seem to come out of nowhere, but that’s not the case. The planets are conspiring to bring you more security, both emotional and financial. Today’s “Eureka!” moment triggers activity in your eleventh house, the place of your deepest hopes and wishes. Don’t pooh-pooh what may be a super idea.

"
10712,30 june 2017,pisces,"Kids, friends, family, your lover–they may all be in a wonky mood thanks to a Mars-Pluto smackdown that’s coming our way. Heck, they can even be stubborn and hot-headed, but you’re in a good spot. Healing Jupiter is chilling out your emotions and thoughts, so just roll with it.

"
10713,30 june 2016,pisces,"Feel like the Love Boat is sailing without you? Venus is happily ensconced in your house of romance, setting your mind alight with thoughts of long-lasting love. But Pluto is on the opposite side of the heavens, slamming on the brakes. There may be a good reason for this, however–Pluto points out the shadow side of people and situations. Make sure that you’re not over-romanticizing a partner or a relationship; see it clearly for what it is.

"
10714,1 july 2017,pisces,"Your ability to speak your mind increases dramatically as a constructive Moon-Neptune aspect opens up the lines of communication. This vibe continues all week, and it includes family members, friends and romantic partners. Whether they’ll respond favorably or not is another issue, but at least you’ll be at peace!

"
10715,1 july 2016,pisces,"Yum! What a day for romance, Pisces. Planet of love Venus winks at lucky Jupiter in the house of long-term commitment. Are those wedding bells I’m hearing? The sound of you giving your phone number to a new hottie–who could become your spouse? No matter what your status–happily involved, disgruntled or looking–you stand a good chance of experiencing a turnaround in matters of the heart.

"
10716,2 july 2017,pisces,"The grass may appear greener on the other side, Pisces, but is it really? A difficult Mars-Pluto smackdown could be stirring up the “green” in you or people around you, and I’m referring to jealousy. Don’t go down this path, as the upcoming full moon on the 8th is all about your  deepest desires.

"
10717,2 july 2016,pisces,"If you don’t love what you do for a living, you need to ask yourself why. Sure, not every day at work is going to be a fun-filled extravaganza. But if you have more crummy days than good ones, you should be reconsidering how to bring more joy into your work. You may not need a new job; a change in attitude may do the trick.

"
10718,3 july 2017,pisces,"A fun day awaits as planets in some of the most playful houses are active. Maybe you’ll decide to take the kids to the beach or the science museum. Perhaps a romantic dinner alone with your amour will do the trick. If you’re single (or in need of some “me” time), plot some kind of adventure, an activity that you’ve never tried before. Seize the day!

"
10719,3 july 2016,pisces,"Tomorrow’s new moon occurs in your house of romance, but you get a head start today with a fabulous trine between the Sun and Neptune. The watery planet is dousing you with charisma and the desire to experience only the best in love. The new moon will open up a six-month period in which you can open your heart and receive the kind of love you deserve.

"
10720,4 july 2017,pisces,"Your home environment will be the focus through the 31st as glam Venus, planet of comfort, eases her way into your domestic sector. Not only is this a smart time to beautify your house and garden, it’s also stellar for working out issues with the family unit. But you’ll be in a practical and budget conscious mood when Mercury enters Leo on Wednesday.

"
10721,4 july 2016,pisces,"Lights, camera, action! The new moon shines its light on your talent, image and ambitions. You’re in an extraordinarily inspirational time, as illuminating Neptune is quite active. And with disciplined Saturn backing you up in the career zone, you can take your ideas and run with them.

"
10722,5 july 2017,pisces,"Trying to get your groove back? Searching for more fun and less stress in your life? Then you’ll enjoy today’s Sun-Neptune trine, a perfect aspect for getting in touch with your more frivolous, light-hearted side. But you won’t get there if you’re too busy focusing on all the things that you perceive are going wrong. Let them be for a day.

"
10723,5 july 2016,pisces,"Time for a makeover! A glamorous trine between Neptune and Mercury tells you to take a look in the mirror and figure out what can be dolled up a bit. Yesterday’s new moon fell in your romance sector, opening up a new chapter. You can look good for yourself, of course…but there’s nothing wrong with looking hot for the masses!

"
10724,6 july 2017,pisces,"It’s time to stop being your own worst enemy, Pisces. The emotional junk in your mind needs to go so that you can start enjoying life more. Besides, with a full moon coming this weekend in your house of camaraderie, you don’t have time to waste on your woes. Interesting people are out there doing interesting things, and they want you to joint them.

"
10725,6 july 2016,pisces,"Lucky you! The two lovers of our solar system, Mars and Venus, are forming the most glorious angle possible in the heavens. What’s more is that they’re telling you to take chances in love. Nothing stupid, mind you, like dating bad boys or divas, or taking on lovers with more issues than the people on Dr. Phil. Nope, this is about bringing more pizazz into your looks, your life, your attitude and the kind of love you want to enjoy.

"
10726,7 july 2017,pisces,"Venus in your comfort-driven fourth house may be encouraging you to plop down on the sofa with a good book or Netflix, but tomorrow’s full moon falls in the house of your most cherished dreams and wishes! What’s a Pisces to do? Use that sofa time for daydreaming about things that could become a reality. Write them down while you’re at it.

"
10727,7 july 2016,pisces,"Friend or frenemy? You’ll be questioning the allegiance of some of the people around you as shadowy Pluto acts up in your house of groups and acquaintances. Perhaps a pal doesn’t approve of your lifestyle or choice of lover. Maybe there’s some jealousy at play. A romantic partner may want more commitment right now than you’re willing to give. But things improve on Saturday, so don’t get blue over what is a temporary hiccup.

"
10728,8 july 2017,pisces,"Despite some recent wonky cosmic energy surrounding friends and colleagues, tonight’s full moon could bring you together with people for some kind of victory. Perhaps your team at work will be finishing a major project, or a charity you’re involved with scores a big donation. Maybe it’s simply a matter of hanging out with your friends and making plans for a party or group vacation. With your ruler Neptune in a good spot, you can end up being the glue that holds the group together.

"
10729,8 july 2016,pisces,"Need to have a talk with a loved one? Your aspects for having a constructive conversation are excellent. Mercury will help put the right words in your mouth and Jupiter aims to bring you closer together. This energy continues over the weekend, a great time to resolve issues that need to be put to rest.

"
10730,9 july 2017,pisces,"Some people just seem to love drama, no matter how unpleasant it may be, but you don’t have to be a part of their theatrics. Avoid those who seem hell bent on making life more complicated than it needs to be.

"
10731,9 july 2016,pisces,"Your closest ties can take a quantum leap forward, as planetary influences are determined to bring you only the best in relationships. Today’s action will cement an existing alliance or perhaps bring in a new one that will be around for quite some time!

"
10732,10 july 2017,pisces,"You may want to head to the nearest cave and hide, as people around you could be acting out in a dramatic fashion. This energy will reoccur on the 17th and 20th, so if you don’t experience it today you could over the next two weeks. The question is: do you want to engage in someone else’s theatrical meltdowns? If not, keep your distance.

"
10733,10 july 2016,pisces,"Looking for love? If so, today’s a winner, and you should take advantage of the beneficial energy the cosmos is delivering. The key is to keep an open mind and consider someone who’s not your usual type. Attached Pisces are advised to be more philosophical about their relationship in order to make it work. This may mean reframing your ideas or taking on a new point of view, but the results will be worth it.

"
10734,11 july 2017,pisces,"If you need to take some quiet time alone to sort out your emotions and thoughts, then today is a good time to do so. There has been too much tension and drama coming from other people around you; recharge your batteries and do a little pampering.

"
10735,11 july 2016,pisces,"Tired of being the household maid? If you’re the one performing all the grunt work while your kids and SO track in dirt, don’t do the dishes and lounge in front of the TV, things may reach critical mass. Lay down the law by implementing new routines and chores–and screw giving out allowances. With Venus and Mercury just about ready to enter your house of efficiency, you’re going to want your home to be a smooth-running machine.

"
10736,12 july 2017,pisces,"People around you may have been acting out lately, but fortunately the emotional Moon enters your sign today, calming the waters of your mind. You don’t need to run and hide from others; just be yourself. Live in the eye of the hurricane and nothing will be able to ruffle your feathers.

"
10737,12 july 2016,pisces,"Attention all Pisces who fell off the fitness wagon around January 15th! The cosmos is giving you another chance to go for your personal best. Sexy Venus enters your sixth house of wellness and physique, ushering in a new period in which you can make amazing headway. Chances are with Venus active, your interest in getting in shape is more about vanity than following doctor’s orders, but who cares. Mercury joins her tomorrow and the Sun follows on the 22nd. With these three urging you to shape up, you could be looking smokin’ hot in no time.

"
10738,13 july 2017,pisces,"Your self esteem rises as Neptune, your ruler, meets up with the passionate Moon. And why not? You’re worthy of happiness. If you need to step away, though, from the dramas that other people are creating in order to feel better about yourself, then do so.

"
10739,13 july 2016,pisces,"Mental fog, begone. Quick-thinking, nimble Mercury is now in your efficiency zone, urging you to clear off the top of your desk, empty out your e-mail account and create new protocols. They say that an organized desk is the sign of an organized mind, and there’s something to that. Going the feng shui route at home and the office will lead to peace of min.

"
10740,14 july 2017,pisces,"Simplify, simplify. This is the perfect day to get down to basics in all areas of your life: health, fitness, your home environment and work flow at the office, just to name a few. Why make things so complicated? The upside is that as simplification grows, so does your serenity.

"
10741,14 july 2016,pisces,"Attitude adjustment! People make the world go round, as the saying goes, and different folks have quite contrasting and diverse view points. Today you may meet up with someone whose ideas are fundamentally different than your own, but this shouldn’t be a problem. On the contrary–it should help you expand your own awareness, even if it challenges you.

"
10742,15 july 2017,pisces,"Go ahead, flirt your little heart out! With the Moon in your sign winking at Mars in your house of frisky fun and romance, this is no time to be a wallflower. By the way, this also happens to be the sector that governs the luxe life–so is a shopping spree in order? I think so!

"
10743,15 july 2016,pisces,"No more indecision, waffling or feeling wimpy! A strong Saturn-Moon meetup in the heavens is designed to put you in control of your life. Not just for today, not just for the week, but for perpetuity. This isn’t about being bossy or bitchy, but rather about you being the captain of your own ship. You can’t control the winds, but you can trim the sails.

"
10744,16 july 2017,pisces,"You might come to a quick decision about a money or career matter, a change that needs to be made. Perhaps it’s to switch jobs or even fields. Maybe it’s to severely curtail your spending. Whatever it is, others may not support you 100%. Change makes them uneasy. But having more money in the bank is essential right now, so go for it.

"
10745,16 july 2016,pisces,"Your idea of excitement and fun may be quite different than your lover’s, Pisces! A Sun-Uranus square indicates that your SO may be stuck in a rut, whereas you’re ready to experiment. So if you’re getting tired of watching TV on Saturday nights and eating pizza, or your boudoir activity is a real snooze, you’re going to be fired up to toss out boring old routines. Singles: stop looking for a new partner in the usual haunts. Planetary influences tell you to switch things up.

"
10746,17 july 2017,pisces,"Just how much drama and intrigue do you want in love–and how much contentment and security? Today’s a time when you can’t have both, so choose wisely. Chances are you’ll opt for more structure and stability once the Sun enters Leo on Thursday.

"

But in order to move forward, an internal inventory is required. Assertive Mars forms a helpful trine today with Chiron, the wounded healer. What do you need to release or heal in order to progress? Slow down, and get in touch with the deepest part of your psyche.

"
10748,18 july 2017,pisces,"Optimism increases and fears of failure start to dissipate with a happy Venus-Jupiter trine. Sometimes the only thing holding us back from true happiness is ourselves, something that may become clear today. Get ready to take that important next step!

10750,19 july 2017,pisces,"It’s time to examine your habits and routines and come up with better ones that will stand the test of time. Flying by the seat of your pants is no longer an option, and if it takes you a few weeks (or longer!) to create smarter systems, so be it.

"
10751,19 july 2016,pisces,"Your best bet these days for achieving your ambitions is to join a group or work with a team. Today’s full moon in the networking part of your chart suggests that some kind of team effort will soon be coming to fruition, quite successfully at that. Whether you want to lose weight, meet a new hottie or get ahead in your career, consider what associations, clubs or industry events will get you there the fastest.

"
10752,20 july 2017,pisces,"Look out! People of the Pisces persuasion are going to be on a roll, so get out of their way. That’s because energetic Mars barrels into their house of organization and productivity today, a place it hasn’t been in two years. Martha Stewart is their new patron saint.

"
10753,20 july 2016,pisces,"Your ability to impress the boss, a prospective employer or a client is off the charts today, thanks to a sweet Venus-Saturn trine. Saturn has been pushing you into taking more command of your career, telling you to think longer term and show the world what you’ve got. It falls into place with Venus by your side. Go after the gig, the assignment, the promotion, the deal.

"
10754,21 july 2017,pisces,"Something unexpected could happen today that may throw you off your game a bit, and the worst thing you can do is to get emotional about it. Logical thinking needs to win out, so step away from an obstacle or drama and consider it through a rational, objective lens.

"
10755,21 july 2016,pisces,"Let your intuition be your guide. The Moon in Aquarius heightens your sixth sense, helping you see the truth behind facades. A positive Jupiter connection assists you in understanding a romantic relationship with deeper insight.

"
10756,22 july 2017,pisces,"More powerful than a steaming locomotive! No, it’s not Superman–it’s Pisces. The Sun has just joined Mars in your house of productivity, turning you into a whirling dervish of efficient activity. Between now and August 21st you can create new habits and systems that will not only clear up the clutter, but bring serenity as well.

"
10757,22 july 2016,pisces,"No one is going to be able to stop a Pisces from getting the job done, thanks to the Sun entering the most efficient part of your chart! At home or the office, you’ll be a force to be reckoned with over the next four weeks. Try to line up job interviews or salary talks before Saturday, when unpredictable Uranus goes retro in your income sector.

"
10758,23 july 2017,pisces,"Start paying closer attention to your budget, Pisces. The new moon in Leo today is a godsend in that it can help you pull your life together both at home and in your business, but the planets suggest focusing on your finances first. Do this and everything else will fall into place.

"
10759,23 july 2016,pisces,"It’s all about me! The Moon enters Pisces for the weekend, making it all about you indeed–but not in a selfish way. Inspirational Neptune is in fine form, encouraging you to glam up your looks, your home and your lifestyle. If you feel that life has become dull, then get off your duff and get going with an overhaul. Now that the Sun is in Leo, getting fit and toned should be at the top of your list.

"
10760,24 july 2017,pisces,"You have your own life to live, so don’t let someone guilt you into thinking that you owe them a lot of your time and sympathy. If you don’t set some boundaries now you’ll end up a frazzled mess. Time for some new rules!

"
10761,24 july 2016,pisces,"The next few weeks could bring quite a few positive changes at the office. Planets in Leo are trying to get you in a happier place, with better assignments, clients, colleagues and working conditions. Today a strong Moon-Sun connection finds you ruminating about the money you earn, and you might become quite motivated to go after more. Try to plant as many seeds as possible before Friday.

"
10762,25 july 2017,pisces,"Partnering up with people who share your ideas and values becomes easier over the next few weeks. With so much planetary activity in your ultra-efficient sixth house you may be thinking that if you want something done you’ve got to do it yourself, but that isn’t the best MO.

"
10763,25 july 2016,pisces,"A team venture may go off the rails today as issues over budgets and responsibilities arise. Whether it’s your wedding or a tech startup, you need to get clear on who’s supposed to be doing what and how much it’s all going to cost. Do so before Uranus goes retrograde in this part of your chart on Friday.

"
10764,26 july 2017,pisces,"This is absolutely one of the best days in 2017 to make a commitment to better health and fitness. Energetic Mars meets up with the Sun, the orb that governs vitality and personal power. Just don’t try to run a marathon this weekend if you can’t run around the block, as Mars might make you too  motivated.

"
10765,26 july 2016,pisces,"Give a “voice” to your dreams by taking some time to write them down. Grab a pad of paper and a pen and spell out just what you’d like to see happen in your life over the next year or so. The full moon on the 19th encouraged you to set your sights higher. Why not create a vision board or notebook that will make your ideas come alive?

"
10766,27 july 2017,pisces,"According to your chart your finances could use a boost, and the next three days are a good time to examine them. Do you have enough tucked away for a rainy day? With so much planetary activity in your uber-efficient sixth house, start creating a practical savings plan.

"
10767,27 july 2016,pisces,"With three planets in Leo, all pushing you to get things done, clear off your desk and empty out your email account (not to mention getting organized at home), you may feel like you don’t have time to chat. But take the time to do so, especially with co-workers or people in your industry today. Your friendliness may open up doors down the line that you may not expect.

"
10768,28 july 2017,pisces,"Today is perfect for following your heart’s desire, so don’t get strong armed into doing something that you don’t feel like, even if it’s just going to a movie or a particular cafe. In the days ahead you need to take care of #1 a little bit more, but that doesn’t mean that you’ll be alone!

"
10769,28 july 2016,pisces,"While Mars is pushing you into thinking big and only wanting to take meetings with movers and shakers, you might want to consider what the “little people” have to say. In your rush to make headway you might miss some key points and ideas that are floating around out there. Be present enough to pay attention to them.

"
10770,29 july 2017,pisces,"Something might happen today that could make you think that the security of a particular situation is threatened, but this is a temporary cosmic blip. Unpredictable Uranus is acting up like a crotchety old man who’s complaining about minutiae. By tomorrow he’s back on track with a smile on his face, so chill.

"
10771,29 july 2016,pisces,"Famed sports psychologist Jim Loehr has said that if you show him an athlete’s weekly schedule, he can tell if they’re going to go pro or not. In other words, the routine makes the man or the woman. Now that Uranus is retro in your house of routines, it’s time to analyze yours for weaknesses and strong points. And since time is money, the more efficient you become, the more you can earn–and save. The next five months can add a lot to your bottom line if you’re willing to put in the discipline.

"
10772,30 july 2017,pisces,"Sometimes we create “rules” or routines for ourselves that just aren’t as helpful as we may think, and today is a good time to toss them. Create some new rules that demand more enjoyment while you’re at it, because charismatic Venus enters your house of romance and fun tomorrow.

"
10773,30 july 2016,pisces,"Start thinking about how teaming up with a collaborator could improve your career or home life, Pisces. Now that talkative Mercury is in the partnership sector it’s a good time to reach out to others who share the same goals and have the same needs. For example, you could agree to watch another woman’s kids while she goes grocery shopping, and she does the same for you. Exercise buddies, writing partners, think tank members–the power of the group can exceed the power of one right now.

"
10774,31 july 2017,pisces,"Been lookin’ for love in all the wrong places? Or maybe you’ve been waiting to spend some quality time with your amour, but things have gotten in the way. Good news–romantic Venus is now in your romance sector, smoothing the path ahead.

"
10775,31 july 2016,pisces,"Balance is needed when it comes to sharing your precious free hours with loved ones, and that may become apparent this weekend. Too much time spent with one group versus another may get someone bent out of shape. If you’re neglecting your lover to hang out with the guys, or your kids aren’t getting any face time, chances are you’ll hear about it.

"
10776,1 august 2017,pisces,"Sometimes ya just gotta strut your stuff and let people know what you’re all about. Do it politely, of course, without bragging. With look-at-me Venus in your house of talent and charisma, people will  notice.

"
10777,1 august 2016,pisces,"You’ve been working hard, Pisces, but you may be questioning why you’re hustling so much to keep other people happy. The planets are trying to push you into more of a leadership role, whether you’re employed by others or want to go the entrepreneurial route. Over the next few weeks you’ll be giving more thought to what you’re capable of, and how to go about achieving it.

"
10778,2 august 2017,pisces,"It’s a smart day to plan your next career coup as mature, long range Saturn is in a solid position. You may want to consider a side hustle or developing a stronger income base while you’re at it, as Uranus retrogrades tomorrow in your earnings sector.

"
10779,3 august 2017,pisces,"Keep a close eye on your expenses, savings and income streams as erratic Uranus goes retrograde in the sector that governs them. This situation will take you all the way into the first week of January, so the best advice is to be thrifty and conservative. If you need to do a side hustle, know that Uranus deals with brilliant ideas, so you could hit upon a few genius methods for earning more.

"
10780,3 august 2016,pisces,"Yesterday’s new moon kicked off an intense period ahead in which you’ll be cutting through red tape, dismantling idiotic protocols and shattering glass ceilings. But in order to do so, you’ll need a reliable and logical routine and some effective new habits. Innovative Mars sparks your brain with some smart, productive habits. Implement them right away.

"
10781,4 august 2017,pisces,"The company you keep needs to be true blue, Pisces. A Jupiter-Pluto square could bring out the truth about a person who may not have your best interests at heart. Or they may be jealous, resentful that you’re leading what they perceive to be the good life. A little space may be necessary for awhile until they get their priorities straight.

"
10782,4 august 2016,pisces,"Clearing up confusion is necessary if you want to move on in a relationship, and you need to start with yourself! Neptune in Pisces is acting up this week, causing you to question alliances with others, both in business and romance. The problem is that the folks around you may be coming on rather strong, and you’re wondering whether you need to push back or not. The answer is yes. Set boundaries, define limits.

"
10783,5 august 2017,pisces,"It’s shape-up time! A sparkling Sun-Neptune aspect tells you to work that body, and it you’re already involved with a particular diet and exercise regimen, to switch it up a little. Major advances in other health issues can take place thanks to Monday’s lunar eclipse, so get ready for some healing to begin.

"
10784,5 august 2016,pisces,"Sweet! Love planet Venus graciously slips into your house of committed relationships today. While singles may get off the fence and look for love, and attached Aquarians will want more amour, planetary influences indicate that there’s a new Pisces in town. You’re done  with putting up with nonsense, games and partners who can’t commit. It’s time to create unwavering standards as to what you’ll accept in a romance.

"
10785,6 august 2017,pisces,"Someone close may say or do something that rattles your cage, and as a result you may end up questioning the relationship. It could be that they’re just having an off day, so don’t read too much into it. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in the most intuitive part of your chart should shed some light on all of your key connections.

"
10786,6 august 2016,pisces,"Venus may now be in your commitment sector, stirring up thoughts of passionate romance, but this weekend’s aspects are all about Reality (with a capital R). Let’s face it, relationships have a certain dynamic. People can become bossy, play the martyr, act as enablers and all the many other roles that exist in love. What’s going on in your romance? One thing’s for sure–if you’ve been treated like a doormat or are being taken for granted, that’s going to come to a crashing halt once Saturn turns direct on the 13th.

"
10787,7 august 2017,pisces,"A highly cathartic lunar eclipse in the most healing part of your chart opens up a door to greater serenity and vitality, as both your physical and mental well-being are affected. This is a super time to put some new habits in place that will enable you to feel better, whether it’s meditation or working out. With motivator Mars in such a good angle you’ll be hell bent on seeing progress.

"
10788,7 august 2016,pisces,"Neptune, your ruler, is making you question your deepest relationships. With love planet Venus now in your house of romance, things should  be getting steamier, but you may be having doubts. Your needs and desires are pitted against those of your partner. But this isn’t a deal breaker. You’ll have the chance to talk things over in a constructive manner on Wednesday, and when Saturn goes direct on Saturday  you’ll be stepping into your power.

"
10789,8 august 2017,pisces,"If you feel like hiding away in your garret while you plan world domination, blame it on the recent eclipse in your hush-hush twelfth house. And if that includes starting your own business or climbing the ladder in your industry, you’re in luck. Brilliant Uranus is inspiring you to come up with some new ideas for success. Pay attention to your dreams as well as your daytime intuition.

"
10790,8 august 2016,pisces,"It may be tempting to listen to the advice of others, but the planets warn that your own inner voice is the best guide right now. Even if the people around you have your best interests at heart you need to make your own decisions. Saturn is now retrograde in your house of authority, so it’s not surprising that you may be second-guessing yourself. But it goes direct this Saturday, leading to greater clarity.

"
10791,9 august 2017,pisces,"Working as part of a team, group or family unit always presents challenges, but today they can be smoothed over. Chances are you’re the one who’s going to have to take charge, at least initially, but if you don’t things will become even more convoluted. Get the ball rolling then step aside.

"
10792,9 august 2016,pisces,"The Moon in Scorpio is pushing you to think beyond “the usual” today–you know, the usual hairstyle, the same old vacation, the old familiar restaurant, the same career path. Venus also encourages you  to take a risk, even if it’s just a small change that will make you feel that you’re getting out of a rut. Life’s too short not to sample everything that’s on offer.

"
10793,10 august 2017,pisces,"Your financial security is directly tied in with solid habits, so take a good look at your spending and savings habits to see if there’s an area that could stand some improvement. If a lover–or your kids–are running up bills, a smooth talking Mercury-Venus aspect will enable you to talk things over with them.

"
10794,10 august 2016,pisces,"The Moon in Scorpio is advising you to schedule a play date, Pisces, and I’m not talking about your kids. Heck no, it’s time for you to book an adventure with some friends or a lover–or both! Your romance does  look like it could use a little “refreshing”, and the cosmos suggests that some private time with your amour could lead to discussions about future plans.

"
10795,11 august 2017,pisces,"If you need to vent to someone close, today’s a good time to do so. With the Sun in your practical sixth house, you should be able to speak your piece without a lot of drama. Tomorrow Mercury retrogrades in your partnership sector, so get issues out on the table right now.

"
10796,11 august 2016,pisces,"Support for an important idea of yours may come from a surprising place, a nice thing to happen. With Saturn getting ready to move forward in your ambitious tenth house on Saturday, you might already be getting the feeling that positive changes are on the horizon. When the Moon swings past assertive Mars and disciplined Saturn today, you’ll be charging up your batteries as you ready for the next chapter.

"
10797,12 august 2017,pisces,"Touchy much? Mercury retrogrades in your moody twelfth house til the 31st, making you vulnerable to reading too much into things and feeling hurt. This is especially true in your closest relationships as murky Neptune creates confusion. But by the time of the solar eclipse on the 21st, clarity should start to return.

"
10798,12 august 2016,pisces,"Someone needs to take charge of a situation, Pisces, and you’re looking like the person for the job–like it or not! It doesn’t matter if this has to do with a family issue, a romance, or something at work. It seems that roles have to be reassigned and new routines established. Someone in your circle might object, but things have to get done.

"
10799,13 august 2017,pisces,"The next six months are awesome for gaining control of your life and feeling like everything is in its place. A powerful Sun-Saturn trine helps set things in motion. Good habits are the secret sauce, so examine yours and make sure that they’re up to par.

"
10800,13 august 2016,pisces,"Flying solo or going the group route? Serious Saturn has been retrograde in your house of ambition for five months, forcing you to analyze your biggest plans . It was a necessary phase that allowed you to tweak things up and make them more coherent. In doing so, you may have questioned staying on the same path in love and career, or leaving those folks altogether for a new path: either traveling on your journey by yourself for awhile, or finding new partners. The choice is up to you.

"
10801,14 august 2017,pisces,"Super day to speak your mind with a lover or kids, thanks to a helpful Moon-Venus connection. Venus’s gentle presence means that screaming and ultimatums won’t be necessary. Tell it like it is, with love and authority.

"
10802,14 august 2016,pisces,"You are ruled by watery Neptune, and as such your emotions run deep. But today there may be some ruffled waves on the surface as Neptune opposes Venus in your partnership sector. What you need, want and value may be quite different than someone else. Your best bet is to talk things over with a trusted confidante, as the Moon is forming a helpful angle from your house of friends.

"
10803,15 august 2017,pisces,"Not everyone around you shares your opinions, values and dreams, something that can become apparent with today’s Venus-Pluto opposition. The question is whether you want to fight with them about it or not. Sometimes the wisest choice is to step aside and let things work out organically, over time.

"
10804,15 august 2016,pisces,"It seems lately that your friends are making a lot more sense than the other people in your world, so if you need to get something off your chest, reach out to a trusted pal. Their input could help you immensely. With Pluto and the Moon so active in your house of friendship, there are also people hovering in the periphery of your life whom could end up being mentors. Keep your mind open about expanding your social circle.

"
10805,16 august 2017,pisces,"It’s time to get your emotions out of the way when it comes to dealing with family matters, which is no easy task! The cosmos is telling you to take a practical approach, rather than falling back on old ingrained family patterns and feelings. Sometimes you just have to see things for what they truly are.

"
10806,16 august 2016,pisces,"Shake things up! Rebellious Uranus in your income sector is on a roll today, urging you to think in a completely different manner about how to make more money. It forms a magnificent angle with the Sun in your productivity sector. It seems that there’s a way to increase your earnings that is faster and more streamlined than what you’re doing now. Pay attention to your process.

"
10807,17 august 2017,pisces,"Pisces, this is no  time for irresponsible flings, torrid affairs or stirring up unnecessary drama in an existing relationship. With luxury-loving Venus in your house of romance, you may feel like you have the freedom to take some risks—but the cosmos says otherwise.

"
10808,17 august 2016,pisces,"Groovy, baby! Sexual and romantic chemistry are in the air, thanks to a yummy Venus-Pluto trine. And this isn’t about a Tinder hookup. No sirree, we’re talking the real deal: commitment. Singles could find a new love online or through a friend. Couples can find more satisfaction by taking up activities together or with a group. The couple that plays together stays together.

"
10809,18 august 2017,pisces,"You definitely need to devote this weekend to spending time with a lover, your kids, or your own pursuits, such as a sport or hobby. A Moon-Venus connection urges you to have fun…especially considering that Monday’s solar eclipse will be all about getting grunt work done over the next six months!

"
10810,18 august 2016,pisces,"It’s time to get real about a partnership, Pisces. Today’s full moon in the most confidential part of your chart will find you ruminating over the state of your union. With Jupiter opposing Chiron, you need to ask if you’re deluding yourself about a commitment, be it romantic or business. Rebellious Uranus is acting up from your security sector, demanding answers. But with optimistic Jupiter by your side, your future looks promising.

"
10811,19 august 2016,pisces,"With the emotional Moon gliding past watery Neptune in your house of goals and self-image, you may be waffling about which direction to go in with a plan. And to make matters more complicated, someone close to you may be putting in their two cents worth. They may mean well but it won’t help bring about clarity! What will  help, however, is the union of Mars and Saturn next Wednesday in your house of authority.

"
10812,20 august 2016,pisces,"Three planets in Virgo are working hard to fill up your social calendar and to find you a mate, if you’re in the market for one. The Sun is getting ready to join them on Monday, so get ready for a busy month ahead. However, you may feel like just chilling chez vous today. Peopled out? Maybe! That’s OK. Charge your batteries over the weekend and rejoin the human race on next week.

"
10813,21 august 2016,pisces,"Don’t feel rushed into making a major decision that deals with your career or goals, Pisces. While it’s nice to have a handle on things and feel secure about the future, taking your time has its advantages. Your ability to make sound, rational decisions is growing; insecurities may rattle you a bit, but in the end logic and confidence will win.

"
10814,22 august 2016,pisces,"People are going to start paying attention to you, Pisces. As the Sun rolls into Virgo, your house of relating to others, you may find that folks are interested in what you have to say and what you have to offer. Better yet is that assertive Mars and wise Saturn are developing your sense of authority and persuasiveness. It’s time to kiss insecurities goodbye.

"
10815,23 august 2016,pisces,"The secretive Moon encourages you to spend some time alone today with your thoughts, especially when it comes to achieving a goal or ambition. Tomorrow Mars and Saturn meet up in your house of success, fame and kudos. It’s an amazing aspect that can take you far. But a little foresight behind closed doors will help you make key decisions.

"
10816,24 august 2016,pisces,"A highly auspicious aspect in the heavens can take your ambitions to new heights, Pisces! Energetic Mars and disciplined Saturn meet in you house of fame, kudos and career. This is about as good as it gets, but watch the tendency to get pushy, thanks to assertive Mars by your side. It’s also possible that someone may try to corral you into making a decision, but if you need more time, take it. Partnerships are favored with a strong and profitable Moon-Jupiter trine. Take this energy and run with it!

"
10817,25 august 2016,pisces,"Despite some really positive action taking place in your success and career zone, you seem a little frazzled. Insecurities from way back in the day (like childhood) could be rising to the surface. Old patterns die hard, and the dynamics found in families can follow you around for decades, even if people have crossed over. Give yourself permission to be content, successful and happy.

"
10818,26 august 2016,pisces,"If someone comes on strong with you today it could make you lose your self-confidence rather quickly. But stop questioning yourself–and don’t give up your power to others. You have what it takes to win and be happy, but sometimes you just need to remind yourself that!

"
10819,27 august 2016,pisces,"A romance can take an amazing turn as the two most beneficial planets in the sky, Venus and Jupiter, meet up in the heavens in a tight embrace. They will be less than 1 degree apart, something that won’t happen again for another 50 years. Singles are in a prime position to meet a new partner, and a serious one at that. Already committed? It’s an excellent day to make progress by talking things through. It’s an emotional day where you can really open up in a way you may not have before.

"
10820,28 august 2016,pisces,"Chiron, the wounded healer, has taken up residence in your house of self-esteem for quite some time now. Its goal is to help you transcend the limits and problems of the past. Today it forms a luscious angle with the Moon in your house of romance and enjoying life. Let go of any crazy ideas that you’re not good enough or don’t deserve love and some time off.

"
10821,29 august 2016,pisces,"Hmmm. Some interesting stuff is going on in the heavens, Pisces. Sexy Venus enters your house of libido today where she’ll remain for the next three weeks, stirring up your lust. But Mercury retrogrades tomorrow in your partnership zone which could bring up past resentment, grudges and fears. I suppose if you like fighting and making up with soul searing sex, these aspects are fine for you. But if you prefer less drama then tread warily.

"
10822,30 august 2016,pisces,"With so much planetary energy focused on partnering up these days, you may have reached a point in which you say “enough!” Sometimes we just need some “me” time and that may become apparent as Mercury retrogrades today in your house of alliances. If there have been problems in a romantic or business relationship they may be dragged out into the light for reexamination–and discussion.

"
10823,31 august 2016,pisces,"“Are you ready for the thing called love–don’t come from me and you it comes from up above. I ain’t no porcupine, take off your kid gloves. Are you ready for the thing called love?” Well, that just about says it all for you, Pisces. Songwriter John Hiatt penned these words years back and boy are they applicable to you! With tomorrow’s eclipse in the partnership zone and sexy Venus in the house of libido, you should definitely  be ready for that thang.

"
10824,1 september 2016,pisces,"Cold feet? An amazing solar eclipse occurs today in your commitment sector, indicating that a serious keeper is on the way for singles. Already attached Pisces can find new passion and excitement in their romance. So why aren’t you jumping for joy? Blame Neptune, that murky planet of confusion. It’s stirring up doubts in your house of independence and taking care of #1. This too shall pass, however, and the next six months can be a game changer when it comes to amour.

"
10825,2 september 2016,pisces,"Building relationships with partners, be they business or romantic, will be a breeze with a happy conjunction between chatty Mercury and generous Jupiter. Business deals could be quite profitable and past issues in love can be resolved. However, you have to ensure that your needs and priorities aren’t overlooked in the rush to shake hands or share a kiss.

"
10826,3 september 2016,pisces,"It’s a wonderful weekend for having deep conversations with the people who mean the most to you. A happy Jupiter-Moon angle is designed to bring you closer together and let down the walls that may have prevented you from forming a stronger bond. A healing vibe between the Moon and Venus will let the most intense emotions flow with ease.

"
10827,4 september 2016,pisces,"No good deed goes unpunished, and that’s the way you may feel today courtesy of some thankless planetary aspects! Seems like you have the best interests of others at heart, but no matter how much you try to help them, your advice and good deeds go unheeded and unappreciated. Let it go. When Jupiter enters Libra later this week you’ll be entering into quite a soulful, even metaphysical place in which you’ll be able to find meaning to others’ behavior.

"
10828,5 september 2016,pisces,"Your ruler, Neptune, has been at odds with structured Saturn lately, forcing you to separate fact from fantasy. And as this energy builds as we head into the weekend, you may feel more and more frustrated about the practicality of some of your big dreams. The good news is that abundant Jupiter rolls into your house of fiscal strength on Friday, helping you locate the funding for your plans. It won’t happen overnight…you’ll have to hustle…but the opportunity is there.

"
10829,6 september 2016,pisces,"Help could come form a surprising place as the cosmos is lining up supporters who believe in you. The interesting thing is that you may not even be aware that positive conversations are going on behind your back, and it may take some time for you to appreciate it. Just keep doing what you’re doing, as you’re doing a heck of a job impressing others.

"
10830,7 september 2016,pisces,"Collaborations of all kinds are in the cards, with four celestial orbs winking at each other across the heavens. Whether it’s for business or pleasure, forming some kind of partnership with others can further your desires: finding love, making new friends, scoring a career coup, or lightening your load so that you can enjoy more free quality time.

"
10831,8 september 2016,pisces,"Planetary influences are pushing you to build a more solid nest egg, and in order to do so you may need to take a second look at your career. Sure, clipping coupons helps, as well as making smart decisions when it comes to investing. However with the Moon, Mars and Saturn all piled in your tenth house of ambition and success, you could earn more of the green stuff by making yourself more valuable in the marketplace. This may mean starting a business on the side or changing jobs, but whatever you decide to do, the potential for more income is there.

"
10832,9 september 2016,pisces,"Mailbox money. Earning dinero while you sleep. Passive income. Getting paid back for loans you made or court awards you’ve been waiting for. That’s what’s on tap this year as lucky Jupiter is now in your eighth house of savvy investing and financial security.  Oh, and here’s another benefit: your sex life should be fabulous. Do I hear anyone complaining? No? Thought so.

"
10833,10 september 2016,pisces,"Today you might feel as though you’re stuck between a rock and a hard place as Saturn squares Neptune. Saturn is in your house of tradition, structure and following the rules. The question is: are you trying to bend or break them? Or are you suffocating yourself with the need to rigidly follow the rules? Find a happy place in between these two extremes.

"
10834,11 september 2016,pisces,"Your own inner compass will guide you well, so think twice before taking the advice of others in your circle. They may think they know the best things for you to be doing and saying, but you need to make your own decisions under the current planetary influences.

"
10835,12 september 2016,pisces,"Ready to take charge of your life? This week’s lunar eclipse in Pisces will push you to make some major decisions about the direction you’re headed in. And today you may be questioning your career options, as well as your romantic ones. If anything or anyone is holding you back you may cut those ties and blast forward.

"
10836,13 september 2016,pisces,"People who have been taking you for granted, thinking they know all there is about you, your skills and personality are in for a big surprise in the months ahead! Shattering the illusions of others is what this week’s eclipse in Pisces is all about. Get ready to make some waves.

"
10837,14 september 2016,pisces,"Your intuition and common sense are equally powerful today, thanks to a productive Moon-Uranus-Mars aspect. Pay close attention to emotions, thoughts and feelings that bubble up to the surface of your psyche. The upside? You clear out some of the mental trash that’s been building up, setting the stage for more clarity.

"
10838,15 september 2016,pisces,"This could be quite an emotional day for you as the touchy-feely Moon connects with watery Neptune in your sign, Pisces. Feelings that have been buried for months, years even, could be rising to the surface. The best advice is to let them flow, and to not make any major decisions just yet. Tomorrow’s eclipse in your sign will shine its light on what you need to do next.

"
10839,16 september 2016,pisces,"It’s all about you, Pisces! A sparkling lunar eclipse today in your sign is destined to push you into a more exciting lifestyle. Your days of hiding in the shadows are over, Cinderella, so toss that broom and those tired outfits. Change them for a new look and a brand new attitude. This might mean cutting the cord with people and circumstances that have been holding you back, but it’s either that or staying in the cellar, taking care of the evil step-sisters.

"
10840,17 september 2016,pisces,"Yesterday’s eclipse was in your sign, Pisces, and it was designed for you to put an end to things that aren’t working for you and to start afresh. Today a magnificent Mars-Uranus trine is encouraging you to take a look at you biggest goals and ambitions, and get working on them. You may discover that things that were important to you even a few months ago no longer matter, thanks to Uranus wiping the slate clean.

"
10841,18 september 2016,pisces,"You’re hell bent on making things happen. No ambition is too big for you too handle. All of this is good–unless you become too anxious to see results, especially the financial kind. Have no fear: when the Sun enters Libra later this week, you’ll have four weeks in which you can make progress.

"
10842,19 september 2016,pisces,"An opportunity to increase your net worth is on the horizon, and you might catch wind of it today. A positive Mars-Venus aspect could encourage you to reach out to decision makers, investors, or financial advisors. Tuesday is good for holding talks, and when the Sun rolls into Libra on Thursday things can gain momentum.

"
10843,20 september 2016,pisces,"Pluto is the planet of transformation. It acts like a building inspector, pointing out the weaknesses in a situation, and right now it’s focusing on your biggest dreams and wishes. Have you outgrown any previous goals? Maybe you’ve lost interest in a person or a situation and you’re ready to make some changes. If so, you’re in a good spot, as Pluto is in a fine angle all week to perceptive Mercury.

"
10844,22 september 2016,pisces,"Yum. The Sun enters Libra, your eighth house of intimacy, bonding, and closeness—which includes sex! Let’s just say this, Pisces—you’re going to be one lusty creature. The Sun joins happy-go-lucky Jupiter, so between these two, your sex appeal (and appetite) could be off the charts.

"
10845,23 september 2016,pisces,"Your emotions might be all over the place today, especially when it comes to matters of the heart: your kids, your lover or your family.  This is a temporary blip on the radar, so don’t sweat it. Next Monday is the best day in 2016 to resolve any problems or questions you might have.

"
10846,24 september 2016,pisces,"Looks like someone’s been working too hard and could use some down time, and that someone is you! This is a great weekend to kick back with your friends and loved ones, but a tiny voice in your head may be telling you that you don’t have time for fun. Crush that tiny voice and get thee to the nearest watering hole for a cocktail with your tribe.

"
10847,25 september 2016,pisces,"An opportunity could come your way in the weeks and months ahead to get ahead financially. However, there are some strings attached: you may need to go back to school, polish up your skills or learn to work more closely with others in a team environment. If you’re thinking about launching your own business, the timing is perfect. Just make sure that all your talents are up to snuff.

"
10848,26 september 2016,pisces,"Satisfaction comes in many forms, but for most people it is derived from closeness with a loved one and being financially secure. Well, you’re in luck, Pisces, because the annual Sun-Jupiter meeting occurs in your house of intimacy, bonding and wealth. Yes, both love and money are found in the eighth house, and these two luminaries meet today in one of the most fortuitous angles possible. This is soulmate territory, along with building a large nest egg through savvy investing, joint ventures or even your own entrepreneurial launch.

"
10849,27 september 2016,pisces,"Hope you’re well rested! Guns ablazin’ Mars rolls into your house of friendship and camaraderie, kicking open a seven week period in which you should be trying to meet as many new people as possible. While you’re at it, connect with your existing tribe too. In the past few months you may have been reflecting about the quality of your connections, courtesy of Pluto in retrograde here. If certain ties need to be cut, do so with the knowledge that as one door closes, another one opens.

"
10850,28 september 2016,pisces,"You can make headway with close personal relationships today as long as you’re realistic about your expectations. Whether it’s a friend, business alliance or a lover, keep it real. Focus on what comes next in your partnership rather than what you’d like to see happening five years from now. Take care of the present first.

"
10851,29 september 2016,pisces,"Seems like your self-esteem could use a little boost, and the cosmos may deliver that today! You may have a sudden understanding that you’re worth more as a human being than you had previously thought. This isn’t a conceited attitude but a healthy realization that you have a lot to offer–especially in romantic relationships.

"
10852,30 september 2016,pisces,"There could be friction between you and a boss or client, and the key is to not kid yourself about what’s going down. You may initially feel as though they’re calling all the shots but you have more power than you might realize. Abundant Jupiter is in your house of financial security, protecting your interests. Focus instead on building net worth rather than on the dramas caused by other people.

"
10853,1 october 2016,pisces,"Ready for better sex and more intimacy? Who isn’t! And how about more cash coming your way, and I’m not talking about chump change? Ditto. Pisces, you’re in a sweet spot as today’s new moon occurs in your eighth house of deep bonding and financial security. An amorous trine between the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, also takes place making this a good weekend to talk about future plans with your lover. Venus is encouraging you to think bigger and bolder in all areas of your life, so if you don’t have a bucket list, create one now.

"
10854,2 october 2016,pisces,"Getting real about your feelings should be an easier task as the Sun inches ever closer to stable Saturn. No matter what your age, a greater maturity is coming your way in the near future as you’ll be able to get to the bottom of things that may have been troubling you. Today is excellent for some self-healing via meditation or a nice quiet walk in nature.

"
10855,3 october 2016,pisces,"The early part of this week is well aspected for making major decisions about your finances, Pisces. Whether you need to go after an ex for child support, talk to an investment adviser about a retirement fund or start a business on the side, your actions will have long term (and positive!) ramifications.

"
10856,4 october 2016,pisces,"Giving up your own personal power to others is never a good idea, and fortunately for you, a strong Sun-Saturn meet up is enabling you to take more control of your life. The Sun is in the house of your deepest emotions, shining its light on what thought patterns are stymying you and which are helpful. With disciplined Saturn in your house of authority, you can develop positive new mental habits that will stick around for a long time.

"
10857,5 october 2016,pisces,"It’s time to get practical about your finances, and with intelligent Mercury heading into this part of your chart on Friday, you’ll be in good shape to make solid plans. A helpful Sun-Saturn aspect today gets the ball rolling, especially if you feel the need to take more control of your fiscal future. Talk to the boss about a raise, shop your resume or research ways to pull in more revenues for your company.

"
10858,6 october 2016,pisces,"Now that Mars and Pluto are both in your house of networking, the company you keep is all important. And over the next few days you’ll need to keep a sharp eye on the people in your circle, as one of them might be creating a problem in a group dynamic. Slacking, jealousy, infighting, quiet resistance—all of these can erupt, and with optimistic Jupiter in your house of emotions you may be tempted to overlook bad behavior. Don’t—this energy goes on for another ten days or so. Better to squash it now.

"
10859,7 october 2016,pisces,"With quick witted Mercury entering your house of financial savvy, you’re in good shape to make progress in building solid revenues or a bigger bank account. But you’ve gotta keep an eye on the people around you, as there could be some bad apples in the lot. Perform due diligence before hiring an attorney to file a suit. Get references from an investment advisor before you invest. If you work on a team (or head one), sniff out trolls, blabber mouths, divas or those who seem just a tad too competitive. This vibe will continue into the middle of the month, so forewarned is forearmed.

"
10860,8 october 2016,pisces,"It’s now what you know, it’s who you know, and those words ring true this weekend. With the Moon joining both Mars and Pluto in your house of camaraderie, you must  get out there and expand your contact list! The terrific thing is that the people you surround yourself with over the next few days could be highly inspirational to you, opening your mind to new possibilities.

"
10861,9 october 2016,pisces,"Keep a close eye on friends and team members as erratic Uranus is active. One of them may be determined to upset the apple cart by slacking or somehow undermining a productive venture. The good news is that wise Pluto in your networking sector will point out the bad apple(s). And Venus in your expansive ninth house will keep your plans on track.

"
10862,10 october 2016,pisces,"Do what you can to expand your contact list, especially when it comes to your career. A friend or someone you know from an industry you’re interested in could put in a good word for you in the weeks ahead, but you have to let them know that you’re looking. If you’re considering starting a business or entering into a joint venture, tomorrow is one of the best days all year to perform research and talk to others.

"
10863,11 october 2016,pisces,"Sex, intimacy and cold hard cash—the ancients placed these in the same astrological house! Even back then these drove human behavior. Well, you’re in luck today when it comes to matters of the heart and wallet as a generous meeting occurs between abundant Jupiter and sage Mercury. Your libido and net worth can both increase under this audacious aspect.

"
10864,12 october 2016,pisces,"Feeling emo? You might be, considering that the Moon is swinging past vibey Neptune in your sign. These two orbs are squaring Saturn, a rather tense angle. Someone may be putting pressure on you—to perform at work, do things their way within the family, or just bust chops (like you need that). Keep calm and carry on, as the remainder of the week looks like an emotional one all around. The full moon on Sunday helps put you in control.

"
10865,13 october 2016,pisces,"It’s wonderful to have friends, but in our Facebook/Instagram world it’s so easy to get carried away as we compare our lives to other’s. Jealousy and resentment could rear their ugly little heads today as FOMO (fear of missing out) is triggered. You want happiness and the good things in life? Create it! With discipline Saturn in such a helpful place from the house of dreaming big, you can make things happen.

"
10866,14 october 2016,pisces,"With Saturn in your house of tradition “open relationships” and shaky romances aren’t your thing. You’re looking for stability in love (and in work too for that matter), and today the planets are trying to help you find it. With candid Mercury in your house of emotions and bonding, speak up about your concerns. You can get to the bottom of matters and work on a long term solution.

"
10867,15 october 2016,pisces,"An unexpected event or remark could throw you off kilter today, resulting in churned up emotions. You may feel as though your security is being threatened in some way, and perhaps as though some of your dreams or plans are now delayed. Nothing could be further from the truth. Tomorrow’s full moon in Aries helps you gain control of your habits and routines, regardless as to what the world may throw at you.

"
10868,16 october 2016,pisces,"Nothing like having a super moon in the income sector! Yup, a powerful lunation helps you wrap up financial matters, such as a job search, negotiating a raise, putting together a budget or starting a business. To be honest, erratic Uranus is acting up, which could bring an unexpected expense your way. Be careful not to put too much on plastic this week either. But overall, your aspects for earning more are superb.

"
10869,17 october 2016,pisces,"Everybody wants to earn more, but of all the signs you’ll be the most motivated to do so! Yesterday’s full moon in your income sector is pushing you to make changes that will put more cash in your wallet. And today a super Moon-Pluto trine is perfect for contacting people you know and networking at industry events. Think about who can help you reach a higher level–then make the phone call or send them a text.

"
10870,18 october 2016,pisces,"You’re cooking with gas on the career front, Pisces! Sunday’s full moon fell in your house of income, closing out a chapter in which you may not have been earning as much as you would like. Well that’s about to change, starting today. Profitable, lucky Venus glides into your tenth house of ambition and success for a three-week stay. Doors that may have been closed in the past may start to crack open, so make sure you’re ready for good things that might come your way.

"
10871,19 october 2016,pisces,"Doors may start opening for you, Pisces, but it won’t happen unless you decide to start working your contact list. Whether it’s finding a new mate, getting the approval to join a club or landing a sweet promotion, right now it’s all about who you know. A meeting today between Mars and Pluto is designed to help you change your circumstances with the help of other people. Start schmoozing.

"
10872,20 october 2016,pisces,"Your income and expenses could be gyrating these days, all the more reason to create a steady source of income. Even if you already have a secure paycheck the cosmos suggests that you hunt down a second source that you can depend on. The recent full moon in your earnings sector was all about ending your days of worrying about money. Get started now.

"
10873,21 october 2016,pisces,"How creatively are you living your life? Do you always fall back on “the usual”? As in—the foods you eat, the vacation spots you travel to, the safe old bars and restaurants and movie theaters? A Moon-Mars-Pluto opposition today is telling you to take a few chances. Maybe you’re hiding behind a wall of safety, which could be nothing but a rut in disguise. You only live once. Make sure there’s a bit of adventure on your journey.

The recent full moon in your earnings sector was all about ending your days of worrying about money. Get started now.

"
10875,23 october 2016,pisces,"Getting real is what it’s all about today with a fuzzy Jupiter-Neptune aspect. These two are quite inspirational, but they could also lead to some LaLa Land thinking. Not good, considering that Jupiter is in your house of financial security and romantic intimacy. If you’re wearing rose colored glasses, take them off. Don’t put anyone on a pedestal or leave your finances totally in the hands of others.

"
10876,24 october 2016,pisces,"Make your opinion count! Now that intelligent Mercury is in your house of higher thinking, joining the Sun, your brain should be on fire with clever ideas. This is a very mind-expanding vibe, so consider taking a class, listening to TED talks, going to a lecture or book signing, or even traveling to a new location. People from different cultures, be they modern or ancient, could be your best source of inspiration right now.

"
10877,25 october 2016,pisces,"Don’t kid yourself about a career situation today. If your gut is telling you that something’s off, it probably is. Also, be wary about entering into a workplace romance, as it could head south pretty quickly under current planetary aspects. As a matter of fact, it’s wise to take more of an in-charge role when it comes to love. Don’t let your partner make all of the decisions.

"
10878,26 october 2016,pisces,"With generous Jupiter in your house of financial strength for the first time in over a decade, you’ll enjoy a number of days in the year ahead that will help you build a bigger nest egg. Today is one of them, as profitable Venus links up with abundant Jupiter. Venus is in your career house, so consider asking for a raise and more responsibility, searching for a new job, expanding your business or even changing industries.

"
10879,27 october 2016,pisces,"“Live free or die” may be the motto of the state of New Hampshire, but it’s also Pisces’ battle cry today. A powerful meeting of the Sun and Mercury in your independent ninth house will stir you to do your own thing, whatever that means to you: demanding some alone time to pursue hobbies or just to relax, creating a little “space” between you and a lover, going the entrepreneurial route, backpacking across Tibet or doing some freelancing on the side.

"
10880,28 october 2016,pisces,"What is your gut telling you about moving forward with a particular plan of action? A strong Jupiter-Moon connection puts you in touch with some deep feelings and thoughts and you would be wise to heed them. Maybe you’re worried about being hurt or misled again, a possibility with Chiron, the wounded one, in a prominent position. But the current planetary vibes indicate that you can do well in the near future, so be open.

"
10881,29 october 2016,pisces,"Something may suddenly inspire you to take charge of a situation, Pisces, and this is all for the better. Whether it’s your finances, a romantic situation, a family matter or a cherished dream, a new routine seems to be needed. The good news is that Saturn, planet of discipline, is nearby, helping you set new habits and activities in motion–and make them stick.

"
10882,30 october 2016,pisces,"In a rut? Then it’s time to bust out of it! A sparkling new moon in your house of adventure and taking chances occurs today Pisces, and it’s a winner. Neptune, planet of thinking outside the box, is also active, indicating that it’s time to see yourself in a whole new light. It may take others a while to witness the changes in you, but hey–you’ll enjoy the shocked looks on their faces. Neptune happens to be the planet of drama too!

"
10883,31 october 2016,pisces,"Duty or freedom? Follow the rules or break them? You’re caught between dueling planets, some of which are telling you to cut loose, others which are tsk-tsking under their breath. It’s like the old cartoons with the devil on one shoulder and the angel on the other. But his isn’t about doing wrong–it’s more about living life your own way versus following tradition–and everyone else’s expectations of you.

"
10884,1 november 2016,pisces,"You’re in a good position to make big plans and go after some pretty lofty ambitions, Pisces. The Sun forms an aspect with Neptune today that will help clear up some doubts that you’ve had in the past few months about heading down a certain path. You may be worried that you’re considering things that are out of your league or are too much of a stretch, but don’t worry–sober Saturn in your house of ambition will keep your feet on the ground.

"
10885,2 november 2016,pisces,"Big dreams often cost big money, and fortunately for you the planets want to deliver the goods. A lofty Mercury-Pluto aspect tomorrow will encourage you to take risks and stretch past previous boundaries. Then on Saturday, the planets may suddenly show you the way to earning more. The key is to remain open minded about what life offers you; to your surprise there could be some juicy changes coming your way.

"
10886,3 november 2016,pisces,"We’ve all heard the fun phrase “so many men, so little time” but how often do you have so many bright ideas, and so little time in which to accomplish them? That’s the case right now for you, Pisces, as the Sun and quick witted Mercury in the most forward thinking part of your chart are making you feel like you can take on the world. Problem is, there are only 24 hours in a day. Start prioritizing.

"
10887,4 november 2016,pisces,"The more people you meet these days, the better off you’ll be in the future. The cosmos is advising you to expand your social network. That’s not to suggest that your existing tribe isn’t good enough. However, your life is ready to take off on some new and exciting tangents, and you’ll need mentors and guides along the way, not to mention companionship.

"
10888,5 november 2016,pisces,"You certainly have no shortage of bright ideas these days, especially when they come to making more money, meeting new people and exploring the world. Start creating a bucket list because over the next four weeks you’ll be able to start bringing these brainstorms to life. Once Mars enters Aquarius on Wednesday, you’ll be going into highly strategic phase.

"
10889,6 november 2016,pisces,"A number of planets in your career and income sectors are encouraging you to seek out more ways of making money. If you’ve been engaged in conversations with others on this topic, or have been researching the matter, it’s time to stop talking and analyzing. The full moon on the 14th tells you to wrap up this phase and move on to making things happen. When Mercury enters your house of ambition on the 12th, it’s green lights ahead.

"
10890,7 november 2016,pisces,"It’s not enough to have fabulous ideas; you have to turn them into gold, like an alchemist who starts with lead. Today you have that alchemical wizardry with a positive Pluto-Sun aspect. When Mars enters the house of the subconscious mind on Wednesday for the first time in two years, your creativity will be off the charts. Run with it.

"
10891,8 november 2016,pisces,"You’re about to enter an interesting time in which you’ll need to be both friendly and outgoing, yet secretive; authoritative yet passive. Three planets are changing signs later this week, some of which are pushing you into the spotlight while others warn to not share too much about your plans. The key is to balance quiet time with socializing, and to release confidential information only on an as-needed basis.

"
10892,9 november 2016,pisces,"Get ready for a burst of inspiration! Spicy Mars barrels into the house of the subconscious mind, stirring up some serious mojo. Obviously this is fabulous news if you are a creative, but all Pisceans can benefit from this cosmic gift. The best way to finesse it is too carve out down time to work on things that mean a lot to you: your garden, a manuscript, your spiritual path, or improving your physical and mental health. The payoff will please you immensely.

"
10893,10 november 2016,pisces,"Get out of the way! Pisces is on a roll as the Moon connects today with inspirational Neptune. They form a fabulous link with the Sun in the most optimistic and forward-thinking part of your chart, telling you to go big or go home. Nothin’ but green lights ahead.

Now that Mars is in the sector that governs fears, worries and negative thoughts, your brain might be in overdrive, coming up with dramatic scenarios which may or may not be true. If that’s the case talk to a trusted friend, mentor or colleague. With helpful Venus now in the friendliest part of your chart, don’t muddle through issues all by yourself. Seek the wisdom of someone who cares about you.

"

Intelligent, quick witted Mercury is now in your ambition sector, urging you to get you financial future in order. You may need to do some quiet research but reach out to people who can help you move up in your career. It’s not just what you know but who you know that is your ticket to success.

"
10896,13 november 2016,pisces,"If your gut is telling you that something is off, or about to happen in a career matter, it’s worth noting. A strong Mars-Mercury angle is tipping you off about changes that are afoot. Does this spell doom and gloom? Absolutely not! The time may be right for moving on to a new gig or heading down the entrepreneurial path. The next three weeks can be game changers.

"
10897,14 november 2016,pisces,"Wrap up important projects that deal with self-expression, Pisces! A full moon today encourages you to finish the Great American Novel you’ve been working on, your thesis, a social media campaign or simply an important conversation that needs to be held with someone. Heart-to-heart talks with a lover could be somewhat difficult due to a Jupiter-Pluto square, but that doesn’t mean that you should avoid the matter. Your intuition is in high gear, so use that to your advantage.

"
10898,16 november 2016,pisces,"With your ruler Neptune currently in retrograde motion, your self-confidence could be vacillating. One minute you feel on top of things, the next you’re beating yourself up. You’re yearning to feel more in control of your mindset and that chance is coming soon. Once Neptune goes direct on Saturday, a sense of authority and direction returns.

"
10899,17 november 2016,pisces,"Who’s the boss in your closest relationships? With your ruler, Neptune, in retrograde motion you may be vacillating between being active and passive. You may even be craving more independence or space. But the planets indicate that you can find a happy medium between being involved and having some autonomy. Once the Sun moves into Sagittarius you’ll start feeling more in control.

"
10900,18 november 2016,pisces,"Your self-esteem could take a bit of a beating as someone dishes out some criticism your way. This person could be a boss or just someone copping a bossy attitude, and you may feel confused as to how to respond. The best bet is to say as little as possible as you run the risk of coming across the wrong way. You’ll feel more in control within a few days.

"
10901,19 november 2016,pisces,"Woo-hoo! Your ruler goes direct today, ending a potentially indecisive period in which you may have felt stuck in a rut. Even if you knew exactly what to do next, others around you may have been stalling or unwilling to commit. And with the Sun moving into your house of authority on Monday it’s time to be the Boss Lady or Man or your own life.

"
10902,20 november 2016,pisces,"Lights, camera, action! Now that Neptune has gone direct in your sign, it’s time to start making forward progress with your plans. Tomorrow the Sun glides into your house of ambition and success, damn good timing if you ask me. And today the Moon forms a helpful aspect with Uranus, telling you to sharpen your skills as you get ready for a busy month ahead.

"
10903,21 november 2016,pisces,"Got big plans for your career? Now is the time to get moving with them, even though the holidays are approaching. Next week’s new moon on the 29th can open up doors, so be ready to talk to important people in the next few weeks. Now that the Sun is in Sagittarius you can take action on all  of your goals, not just career choices. This weekend is terrific for ruminating about what you’d like to see in 2017. Vision board, anyone?

"
10904,22 november 2016,pisces,"Does moving up the ladder have to mean giving up on other dreams and goals? Some people are of the school that says you have to choose between career and family, or the pursuit of money versus contentment. But that’s not you, Pisces. The planetary aspects on offer this week indicate that you can have your cake and eat it too.

"
10905,23 november 2016,pisces,"It’s time to talk turkey, and I’m not referring to the bird that will be on the dining room table tomorrow. Heck no, I’m talkin’ money—the big kind. Like from a raise, new job or adding profitable revenue streams to your company. A power lunch today between shrewd negotiator Mercury and stable Saturn is perfect for gaining the praise and acknowledgment that you deserve, not to mention the dinero. The new moon on the 29th opens up a two-week window in which you can really self-promote.

"
10906,24 november 2016,pisces,"With happy-g0-lucky Jupiter in your emotional eighth house, you may feel c0mfortable in being an open book, but today’s planetary aspects warn against being too easy to read. Someone in your circle, a friend perhaps, may try to take advantage of your good nature. That being said, there are plenty of people around you who are quality folks. Be selective as to whom you spend your time with.

"
10907,25 november 2016,pisces,"Your most closely held dreams and wishes are the focus of the planets today. Pluto, the great transformer, is asking you to reconsider what it is that you really want as your tastes may have changed. Luxe Venus is by his side, which could be encouraging you to slow down, perhaps, and smell the flowers as you travel along life’s path. This doesn’t mean that you’re going to give up on your aspirations. But you could decide to add more quality down time to your schedule.

"
10908,26 november 2016,pisces,"If you can think it, you can do it. That’s the message the cosmos has for you today Pisces. But it’s not enough to just dream up bright ideas. The proof is in the execution, and with rebellious Uranus in fine form you should be able to dream up new procedures and rituals for making your goals come true.

"
10909,28 november 2016,pisces,"All systems are go, Pisces! A terrific new moon tomorrow can open doors in love, emotional healing, your career and going after just about any goal you can think of. Just don’t expect everyone around you to be on board with your plans. It’s possible they lack the discipline to do what you have in mind. Don’t let anyone dissuade you from taking action.

"
10910,29 november 2016,pisces,"“Fake it til you make it” is a phrase that we hear a lot, especially when it comes to taking on new responsibilities–and you’re not sure if you have the chops to handle them. Today’s new moon presents such a situation as it falls in your house of authority and ambition. But murky Neptune swirls its fog, making you question your abilities. You do have what it takes, and the best way to find out is to go within. Mars is in the house of the subconscious mind, stirring up inspiration galore.

"
10911,30 november 2016,pisces,"Someone in a position of authority could say or do something that will confound you today, Pisces, but think before you respond—and act. The problem is that Neptune is clouding your vision, so it’s possible that you are misreading the situation. Not everyone is out to get you, so just chill and wait for the day to pass. You may soon realize that there was nothing to be upset about.

"
10912,2 december 2016,pisces,"Reach out and touch someone! Chatty Mercury zips into your house of camaraderie today, setting the stage for socializing and networking. The people on your contact list could be influential in introducing you to potential lovers, employers, friends, and business people. This is also the house that governs technology, so if you are in the process of launching a website or online marketing blitz, now’s the time. Get it done before the 19th when Mercury retrogrades.

"
10913,3 december 2016,pisces,"It’s not always necessary to show others who’s the boss, and today you are encouraged to keep your personal power under wraps. This doesn’t mean being a doormat or not speaking your piece. But sometimes it’s smarter to let everyone underestimate you—then shock the daylights out of them later with your success!

"
10914,4 december 2016,pisces,"Chill, grasshopper. The cosmos is telling you to get in touch with the quiet, wise part of your psyche that knows how to heal and nurture your tired mind and body. Take a few moments today to consider what needs to be done to feel more centered and relaxed. When Venus changes signs on Wednesday your progress will accelerate.

"
10915,5 december 2016,pisces,"Change is in the air as the emotional Moon signals spontaneous Uranus. Don’t be surprised if you suddenly redirect your attention and energies to a new course of action, something that is more in tune with the person you’re becoming. This is positive, by the way, and will result in your creating new habits and rituals that are more in sync with your deepest passions.

"
10916,6 december 2016,pisces,"Sometimes you just need to break from the crowd and do your own thing. And often times you don’t need to make a big announcement about it. So while others are pontificating about their brand, their next move, their likes and dislikes, all you have to do is keep on truckin’. Keep your eye on the prize and sally forth.

"
10917,7 december 2016,pisces,"Put on your trench coat and dark glasses—you’re going into secret agent mode. Venus moves into your ultra hush-hush twelfth house, the place where we do things below the radar: look for a new job, quietly go on a diet, have an affair or launch a side business. This is also a good time to ruminate over your 2017 resolutions and figure out your next move. The key is to keep things on the downlow. Not everyone needs to know every single detail of your life.

"
10918,8 december 2016,pisces,"Now that magnetic Venus is in the more secluded part of your chart, you may want to tone things down. As in—your words, opinions, appearance and actions. But don’t be afraid that you’ll turn into a crushing bore. With a serious meeting coming on Saturday between the Sun and Saturn, you’re going to have some major decisions to make. Slow down now and take stock.

"
10919,9 december 2016,pisces,"With the mighty Sun in your career house you’re in an excellent position to make headway. An auspicious aspect today between the Sun and Jupiter recommends that you consider perks as well as income and prestige. Hey, if you can score a better benefits package, go for it. This includes retirement plans, profit sharing and the like, so pay attention to your bottom line.

"
10920,10 december 2016,pisces,"With the mighty Sun blazing a path through your house of ambition lately, you may have felt optimistic and ready to take on the world. But today El Sol meets up with serious Saturn, asking you to slow down a bit. Have you taken on too much? Are your goals and plans realistic? Do you need the advice or assistance of others? Make sure you’re not heading down a path that leads to burnout.

"
10921,11 december 2016,pisces,"You may be asked to join a team or group, or to provide your skills to someone else’s efforts. If that’s the case you should consider it carefully, as a positive Moon-Pluto aspect indicates that this could bring about some happy results in the future. With the Sun blazing away in your house of personal ambition it may be easy to forget that you can go far if you travel your path with others.

"
10922,12 december 2016,pisces,"With two of the most powerful orbs in the solar system, Saturn and the Sun, stationed in your ambition sector you’re really coming into your own as a thinker and a doer. Today sparkles with a special aspect that can help you gain favorable attention, not to mention more cash. Cutting edge ideas are the way to go, and with dynamic Mars about to enter your sign on the 19th, don’t hold back.

"
10923,13 december 2016,pisces,"Ready to be center stage? I certainly hope so, because assertive Mars will be rolling into your sign next week, lighting a fire under you to pursue your passions. The full moon today in your domestic sector urges you to put an end to family or housing dramas, whatever they might be: selling your home, a spat with your parents, kicking out an annoying room mate or working our custody agreements with your ex. You may need to take ownership of matters rather than letting them run their own course, but you’ll be glad you did.

"
10924,14 december 2016,pisces,"Everyone wants a peaceful home and family life, but that doesn’t mean becoming the family doormat in order to achieve peace. If you’re giving more than you’re getting back, it’s time to make others aware that you have your own needs to attend to. The same holds true for friendships that feel draining. The planets are telling you that some self-care and indulgence is necessary right now.

"
10925,15 december 2016,pisces,"A routine or event could get thrown off schedule by a friend, lover or child today. Don’t lose your cool and let it pass, as this is a minor blip on the radar. However, if the people around you are constantly creating roadblocks, last minute crises or are procrastinating, you don’t have to deal with it. When assertive Mars enters your sign next week you’ll be able to put them in their place!

"
10926,17 december 2016,pisces,"Something new and unexpected could show up on your desk today, perhaps an assignment that can take you further than you might imagine. It could also be a job offer. To make the most of this energy, reach out to others who can help you make your mark. In sales or marketing? Then prospect like mad today, as the people you connect with could end up being paying clients down the road. Long term financial benefits could arise from today’s efforts for all Pisces.

"
10927,18 december 2016,pisces,"Who needs to wait til New Year’s Eve to toss out the old and ring in the new? Not you, Pisces! In 24 hours red hot Mars will be entering your sign for the first time in two years. So finish up old business, make some firm decisions about who and what you’d like to have in your life in the year ahead, and start cleaning house. You may actually feel resistant to change today thanks to a Moon-Mars opposition, but that’s OK. You’ll be in the driver’s seat before you know it.

"
10928,19 december 2016,pisces,"You know the saying: if you want to get something done the right way, do it yourself? That may be the way it has to be as Mercury retrogrades today in your house of teamwork. From now until mid-January, group activities may go off the rails due to miscommunication or slacking off on the part of team members. To top it off, aggressive Mars enters Pisces, making you determined to plow through projects. Get moving.

"
10929,20 december 2016,pisces,"Trust issues? With Mercury retrograde in your house of networking and friends you may be wondering who you can count on. Don’t worry—if there are any slackers or frenemies in your midst, they can quickly be replaced! When the Sun enters Capricorn tomorrow, you’ll be meeting a lot of new faces, some of whom will play a big role in your life in the years to come.

"
10930,21 december 2016,pisces,"You’re entering a highly social time now that the Sun is in your house of networking, Pisces! And with charismatic Mars in your sign, you are sparkling like the brightest star in the heavens. So get out of wallflower mode and start strutting your stuff. People will be interested in your opinions, talents, background and where you’re heading. Give ‘em a good show.

"
10931,22 december 2016,pisces,"Your options for building a stronger financial base are improving, Pisces, but you have to make sure that you’ve set some money aside for mundane expenses and emergencies. It’s easy to get fired up about that hot stock tip or a business idea that you’d like to launch but you can’t neglect the day-to-day stuff. Create a solid budget before you plan world domination and the riches that go along with it.

"
10932,23 december 2016,pisces,"A dazzling new self-image may be on your mind today, thanks to a happy Moon-Mars aspect. A feeling of adventure will take hold as La Luna transits the part of your chart that encourages taking risks. Next Tuesday the 27th is a super day to get clear about some of the dreams you’d like to pursue in 2017. Vision boards, anyone?

"
10933,24 december 2016,pisces,"A rare meetup between Saturn and Uranus demands that you think long and hard about your long term plans. Wishful thinking doesn’t cut it here. Get real about your ambitions and the steps you’ll need to take to get there.

"
10934,25 december 2016,pisces,"You’re in a deeply soulful place these days with a number of planets in the vibiest part of your chart. Finding people who share your passions and ideas is something that you should consider, especially with the new moon this Thursday falling in your house of camaraderie. Keep the old pals around, but seek out some new ones who will stimulate your mind.

"
10935,26 december 2016,pisces,"It’s a day to dream big–really  big–thanks to a happy meeting between intelligent Mercury and inspirational Neptune. But you might discover, as you’re creating that vision board or jotting things down on a pad of paper, that your dreams may cost more than you had realized. One of the problems is that erratic Uranus has been retrograde in your house of earnings. The good news? It goes direct on Thursday, so don’t give up on your big plans.

"
10936,27 december 2016,pisces,"It’s time for you to come out of a shell and start to network more. Over the next few weeks you should be considering joining industry or trade groups, single meet ups, and volunteer organizations. Sign up for seminars or weekend workshops while you’re at it. Being around more like-minded people will add a sense of satisfaction to your life that you may not have experienced before.

"
10937,28 december 2016,pisces,"With energetic Mars in your sign for the first time in two years, your needs and dreams are front and center. But what’s the best way to achieve them? A Sun-Mercury conjunction today encourages you to seek out sage advice from someone who can help you. Whether it’s a friend, attorney, savvy expert, life coach or spiritual adviser, make the connections. Then keep the lines of communication open as over the next few weeks they can help you enormously.

"
10938,29 december 2016,pisces,"Lucky you! The cosmos is setting the stage for making new friends and developing important contacts over the next six months. Some of these folks could be instrumental in moving your career and income along, so consider where and how you could be mingling with industry people. Romance is in the stars also, as a pal could make an introduction to someone new.

"
10939,30 december 2016,pisces,"Your friends can be more than just people to share good times with. Let’s face it, they know you best and understand what you do right and where you trip yourself up. If you want an honest opinion about the latter, reach out to a trusted pal and ask for their advice. The unvarnished truth can really set you free.

"
10940,31 december 2016,pisces,"Some people let their self-worth get tied in too much with their occupation or income level. Others are far too worried about competing with their friends. Now that Uranus has gone direct in the house that governs your fondest hopes and wishes, you can get down to the essence of what really floats your  boat, without resorting to head games and useless comparisons.
