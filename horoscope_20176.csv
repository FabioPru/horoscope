1 january 2017,aries,"2017 begins with your subconscious mind in a highly active state, thanks to motivator Mars and intuitive Neptune in fine form. Today’s a day to dream–about what you’d like to manifest in the brand new year ahead. Don’t dismiss thoughts as fantasies or impossible either; with rational Saturn in your house of the big picture, your daydreams may be more achievable than you realize.

"
2 january 2017,aries,"Relationships can start to pick up steam now that Uranus has resumed direct motion. But in order for you to really connect with someone else you need to figure out your own emotions first. Is it time to be an open book and let the other person know exactly what’s on you mind? Or is is wiser to hold back and keep some things to yourself? With the passionate Moon entering your house of secretiveness today, you may opt for discretion.

"
3 january 2017,aries,"Who can you trust? Over the next four weeks the cosmos will be asking you that question, courtesy of hosting Venus in your vibey, intuitive twelfth house. This can be an auspicious time for “cleaning house”, in a manner of speaking. Even if everyone in your world is true blue you still have the opportunity to do some inner work. Ridding yourself of negative thoughts and becoming more mindful is a great way to start the new year.

"
4 january 2017,aries,"Thinking about taking some classes in 2017? Expanding your mind via travel and study? If that’s the case, now’s the time to plan. Mercury retrogrades into your ninth house of broadening your horizons. Attend a lecture or personal growth workshop, learn a new skill, take a chance by becoming an entrepreneur or pen the novel that’s been rattling around in your brain for so long. Carpe diem, baby!

"
5 january 2017,aries,"As erratic Uranus grows ever closer to opposing benevolent Jupiter in the sky, you may feel as though your needs and plans are in direct conflict with someone close, such as your lover or a business partner. This feeling could be amplified today as the emotional Moon is actively stirring the pot. But count to ten and breathe. You’re about to step into quite a powerful situation on Saturday, which could be career related or simply a strong sense that everything is going to start going your way.

"
6 january 2017,aries,"You’ve never been one to hold back, Aries, being known as one of the risk takers of the zodiac. The other sign that’s famous for adventure is Sagittarius. Well, with the Moon in your sign sending smoke signals to Mercury in Sag, it’s time to plan an escapade or two. Listen, Mercury is  retrograde, so today’s a good day just for thinking about your plans. When it resumes direct motion on Sunday, swing into action.

"
7 january 2017,aries,"Haven’t gotten your 2017 resolutions off the ground yet? No problem! A super-charged meeting today between the Sun and Pluto sets the stage for a major strategy session. These are the two most authoritative orbs in the solar system, and they meet in your tenth house of achievement, goals and success. The decision that you make today can be life changing. And with Mercury going direct tomorrow in your house of optimism and busting past limits, it’s nothing but blue skies ahead. Go for it.

"
8 january 2017,aries,"Confusion and concern start to dissipate as Mercury finally goes direct. In your case Aries, financial conundrums should straighten out, such as a medical bill that’s been in dispute, or waiting for a court award check to show up at your lawyer’s office. Matters that deal with commission checks, royalties, child support, inheritances and joint business ventures will smooth over, which will bring a sigh of relief. Been hit with unexpected expenses? That should start to abate too. When Mercury enters Capricorn on Thursday a far more relaxed vibe sweeps in.

"
9 january 2017,aries,"Just the facts, ma’am! That’s your motto o’ the day, Aries, as a tense Moon-Neptune square could completely screw up your ability to intuit what’s going on around you. Keep it real as your emotions could be all over the place, making you the perfect victim for someone else’s not-so-pleasant agenda. Don’t fall for flattery, guilt trips, head games or anything else that has a whiff of BS clinging to it.

"
10 january 2017,aries,"Take a deep breath and count to ten. Someone may be on the warpath today, and with erratic Uranus acting up in your sign, you might overreact. Seems like the other person is trying to gain control of a situation—or even you—and your temper could rise. Let this tempest in a teapot pass by and wait for calmer waters.

"
11 january 2017,aries,"Great day for behind the scenes planning and activity. With energetic Mars in the most confidential part of your chart forming a terrific aspect to Pluto, this is a good time to examine the weak spots in your life (we all have them!). Maybe it’s your finances, or bad eating habits that negatively affect your vitality and physique. Perhaps you’re carrying too much stress and resentment in your waking moments. Stuck in a job you don’t like? This is one of the best times all year to start snooping alternative choices. Carpe diem.

"
12 january 2017,aries,"Domestic bliss? The full moon in Cancer shines its light on housing matters, family issues, your relationship and overall state of contentment. You’re definitely interested in seeing that your life is more serene, but do other people around you share the same idea? A difficult Grand Cross in the heavens could make peace look like a pipe dream right now. Fortunately, chatty Mercury enters your authoritative tenth house today. You may need to put people on notice that you’re not going to deal with drama on a regular basis.

"
14 january 2017,aries,"Sometimes living a more romantic and creative lifestyle is just a matter of an attitude adjustment. Sure, we’d all love a windfall of cash, but the cosmos suggests that a more authentic lifestyle can come just as easily from taking a different viewpoint. How can you get in touch with your inner writer, poet, lover, painter, grande dame or heart throb today?

"
15 january 2017,aries,"Stick to the tried and true today and during the first half of the week: familiar habits, routines and circumstances. This doesn’t mean that you have to put up with them forever if you’re not thrilled with them, but right now is not the best time to change. Quietly figure out what you’d like to switch up, then hit the ground running when Mars enters Aries on the 28th.

"
16 january 2017,aries,"Developing a balance between getting your tasks done and resting up could be a bit tricky these days! But it’s necessary as your life is about to get a lot busier. Try to wrap up some of your bigger plans now, before the Sun enters Aquarius on Thursday. Then you’ll have more down time to chill and have fun with friends.

"
17 january 2017,aries,"It’s essential to know what’s going on in a business situation, as planets in the most ambitious part of your chart are active. Some interesting opportunities could come your way over the next two weeks, and the better informed you are, the easier it will be to make a smart decision.

"
18 january 2017,aries,"“Plays well with others.” Remember that from back in the day on your report card? Well, that’s the way to describe Aries folks over the next four weeks. What’s going to count more than anything, ram, is that you make the effort to cooperate with the people in your orbit, in both your personal life and in business. Don’t worry, your intuition is in fine form, helping guide you along the way. The key is to play nice, even if you’re pushing forward your own agenda—which you will!

"
19 january 2017,aries,"The Sun moves into Aquarius, your eleventh house of pursuing big dreams and large scale projects. But a tense Mars-Saturn aspect warns against taking on too many things at one time. It seems that some inner work needs to be done, too, before you leap headlong into the future. Maintaining serenity is just as important as getting things crossed off your to-do list.

"
20 january 2017,aries,"How deep is your contact list? Over the next four weeks you should aim to make it deeper, now that the Sun is in Aquarius, your house of networking. Making new connections is the way to grow your business, find a new gig and get introduced to a new flame. Aquarius is also your house of technology, so now’s the time to develop a website, app, social media campaign or a post that will go viral.

"
21 january 2017,aries,"Demand more. You heard me. Especially when it comes to love! The moon is in sexy, intimate Scorpio for the weekend, the perfect place for getting closer to your amour or a new soulmate. La Luna sends a sparkling vibe to Chiron, the wounded healer, telling you that you don’t have to settle in matters of the heart. Nope, that’s not your karma.

"
22 january 2017,aries,"The cosmos suggests that you focus on “inner work”, getting in touch with the more spiritual side of your nature. You’re definitely the go-go-go type of individual, but even a hard-charging ram needs to slow down once in awhile to gain perspective. Seeking the wisdom of philosophies that you haven’t been exposed to before could help open your mind to a different way of thinking–and therefore, living.

"
23 january 2017,aries,"Passion and commitment! It helps to have both, and with the Moon conjuncting Saturn today, you will. Sign up for a class, go for a degree, learn a new skill or language, start a business, or even fall in love with someone who’s not the usual type. These two orbs meet up in your multiculti ninth house of adventure and personal exploration. Bon voyage.

"
24 january 2017,aries,"Get ready to rumble. With a glorious new moon on Friday in your house of networking, and assertive Mars moving into your sign on Saturday, you should already start feeling the desire to get yourself out there and mingle. In the weeks ahead it’s the people you know that can help you more than what  you know. An auspicious aspect today suggests that you make a short list of movers and shakers who can help you make progress with your career and other important goals. Start reaching out to them now.

"
25 january 2017,aries,"“I’m mad as hell, and I’m not going to take it any more!” OK, maybe that’s a bit extreme. Perhaps you’re just fed up with things being the same way, month after month, year after year. If that’s the case you’re in an excellent spot to make some changes. That’s because the emotional Moon is making you passionate about your aspirations, which may be changing by the way. Transformative Pluto is telling you to think about what’s really important for you to manifest.

"
26 january 2017,aries,"A more flexible approach may be needed when dealing with the people closest to you, whether it’s a lover or business contact. Fortunately charismatic Venus is in a good spot, helping you assess the situation with strong intuitive knowledge before you open your mouth to speak. This doesn’t mean becoming a doormat, but rather using wisdom rather than brute strength.

"
27 january 2017,aries,"Groups got game! Today’s Aquarian new moon is perfect for launching group or team activities, not to mention social events with your friends like bridal showers and vacays. It’s also an auspicious time to enter into a partnership or hire an expert who can help take your career to a higher, more profitable place. The only caveat is to make sure that you choose your associates wisely, as Saturn’s close presence indicates that these connections might last for a long time.

"
28 january 2017,aries,"You’re a unique individual, and now that Mars is in Aries you have a free pass to show the world just how special you are. It’s time for fresh starts, revamping your image and figuring out what you want out of life. Energetic Mars will give you the drive to make things happen.

"
29 january 2017,aries,"The planets are lighting a fire under your tushie to get moving with some of your bigger plans. Yesterday dynamic Mars barreled into Aries, stirring up your motivation, and today powerhouse Pluto holds a strategy meeting with Mercury. Focus is the name of the game as you concentrate on what’s most important to you, whether it’s finding love or creating the next Microsoft. If any of your aspirations require partnering with someone, keep in mind that Jupiter will retrograde soon in that part of your chart. Choose your closest connections carefully.

"
30 january 2017,aries,"You’ll be able to sniff out trouble better than a police dog at the airport, Aries. Your intuition is in high gear, so use it to your advantage. Now that Mars is in Aries you need to push your  agenda forward. If that means using your sixth sense to weed out people or circumstances that could get in your way, so be it.

"
31 january 2017,aries,"If you have something to say, then say it—but make sure that you measure your words carefully. You may have realized in recent weeks that you need to stand up for yourself more, thanks in part due to Mars in your house of self-esteem. The red planet could make you prone to outbursts, especially if you’re faced with criticism or foot dragging by others. Don’t worry—sweet Venus will soon join Mars, softening the raging bull effect.

"
1 february 2017,aries,"Keeping your cool over the next 48 hours could be a challenge, Aries. The emotional Moon swings past combustible Uranus today in your house of self, making you not very open to being trod upon. You’ll need to be especially careful with a romantic partner or key business contacts, such as the boss or big client. If you can, wait until Friday to talk things over. That’s when gentle Venus glides into your sign, playing the role of peace maker.

"
2 february 2017,aries,"Are you on the right path? With your career, that is. If you long to be in a different field the time is right to do some research about a fresh new occupation that will make your heart sing. Maybe you’re satisfied with your gig, but think that polishing up your work habits will make things flow more smoothly. Create more efficient habits and protocols, and that includes at home too. Energetic Mars is in your sign, Aries, providing you with an abundance of energy to get things done. Overcome inertia and vamanos!

"
3 february 2017,aries,"Hey there, you sexy thang! You’re looking like the hottest thing on two legs now that glamour gal Venus is in your sign. The next two months are perfect for a makeover, not to mention shamelessly flirting and enjoying romance. But what a lot of folks don’t know is that Venus also governs profits, so if you’re looking to earn more now’s the moment to strike.

"
4 february 2017,aries,"If your job has lost its luster and you crave a more meaningful occupation—or simply more cash!—today could bring about some emotional moments. But this is a good thing as the cosmos is stirring you up to take a chance. When Mercury enters your networking sector next Tuesday, start working your contact list and make some new friends in high places.

"
5 february 2017,aries,"Forecast: foggy with a touch of delusion. A confusing Neptune-Moon aspect today finds you operating on pure emotion and not much logic. While this can make for a romantic, gushy Sunday, it doesn’t bode well for making serious decisions. Tomorrow mighty Jupiter goes retrograde in your house of serious partnerships until early June, so if you have any concerns about a romantic or business alliance, don’t worry—you’ll have plenty of time to sort them out.

"
6 february 2017,aries,"Cool your jets! Jupiter begins a four-month slowdown in your partnership sector, perhaps inducing some foot dragging on your part. Not ready to tie the knot quite yet? Hesitating about joining forces with a writing partner, or having a booking agent represent you? Wondering if remaining single is a better choice right now? Chances are you won’t be racing to sign your name on a dotted line anytime soon. But that’s OK. Delays are often needed to ensure that we’e making the right decisions. Study all of your options and hold conversations with people before you enter into an alliance.

"
7 february 2017,aries,"Working on a higher vision, something that affects the common good, is what it’s all about over the next few weeks for you, Aries. With verbal Mercury now in your house of networking and collective efforts, grass roots volunteer efforts can soar, along with other social and business collaborations. This is a people-centric time, so get out of the house and share your opinions with other like-minded folks.

"
8 february 2017,aries,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Aries, something that you will be forcefully reminded about by the cosmos. A tough Moon-Pluto opposition pits your personal needs against those of your career and other responsibilities. Rearranging your schedule to spend more down time with the ones you love is the key, and this weekend’s lunar eclipse in your house of frisky fun is the perfect time to start.

"
9 february 2017,aries,"Who can help you on your path through life? Maybe you’re going through a bad breakup. Perhaps you want to start your own company. Maybe you just want more peace of mind and contentment. Whatever it is, today’s a super day to reach out to a savvy expert who can help you: a mentor, life coach, friend, minister, doctor, therapist, you name it. Don’t try to walk the path all by yourself when there is so much sound advice out there.

"
10 february 2017,aries,"Meowww!! Or should that be “purr”? Lucky Aries enjoys a lunar eclipse today in the romance sector, and the aspects are fabulous. Singles, you could meet a new flame who can go the distance. We’re talking relationship material here as Jupiter is hard at work in your commitment zone. Just take things slow at first. Couples, a new chapter opens up in your relationship, one that’s far more fun. The two of you should be planning vacations and mini-getaways, or perhaps taking a class together—ballroom dancing, learning Spanish or learning how to be a “top chef”.

"
11 february 2017,aries,"Need to convince someone to consider your opinion or feelings? You’re in an awesome spot to do so with a Jupiter-Sun trine. The best part is that your creative juices are flowing, enabling you to connect with others in a way that may have been impossible before. This holds true of friends, lovers, kids and business associates. With Jupiter retrograde you need to take things slow when it comes to moving a relationship forward, be it personal or professional. But at least you can get the ball rolling.

"
12 february 2017,aries,"Don’t push it, weekend warrior. The Moon in the ultra-motivated house of fitness calls your name, but Neptune warns to not get carried away. I know an incredibly fit runner who just recently fractured his hip–running. Yup, too much stress on the bones can do that even to a toned athlete. If you can’t touch your toes or climb a flight of stairs without losing your breath, you need to start by taking baby steps.

"
13 february 2017,aries,"Any time you’re involved in a group effort, someone ends up doing more. More of the grunt work, more of the leadership, more of the organizing and often more sucking up and smiling when others are acting like divas. If you’re carrying too much of the load within a team, it looks like it’s time to rewrite some of the rules and roles. Get this rolling today as this energy continues over the next two weeks, with some super aspects helping you out.

"
14 february 2017,aries,"Sharing is caring? Valentine’s Day is a lover’s holiday, but today the planets are firmly focused on you, Aries! With the cosmic lovers Mars and Venus both in your sign, your desires and needs in romance are front and center. Do you share the same values and goals as your partner? However, as long as you’re willing to consider the viewpoint of another, the energy is strong for long term relationships thanks to mature, stable Saturn in a good spot.

"
15 february 2017,aries,"An energetic Moon-Jupiter connection may make you quite interested in partnering with someone, both in romance and business. But Mars raises his aggressive little head and warns you to protect your interests. This is a fine line to walk. Make sure that the other person is aware of your needs and plans without steamrolling over theirs.

"
16 february 2017,aries,"Let your voice be heard! Today rocks for expressing your opinion, especially in a larger setting such as a group or a team. Don’t be shy about your achievements and ideas with a volunteer organization, your department at work, or even with your friends. Digital and tech ventures can also take flight under these aspects, so if you’re working on a website or social media campaign now’s the time to start developing momentum. This positive energy continues into next week, so use it to your advantage.

"
17 february 2017,aries,"On the same page? Don’t become emotional if someone doesn’t agree with your way of thinking. It’s also possible that group activities get derailed a bit as a consensus can’t be reached. The mood changes on Monday, so if possible hold off till then to make your point.

"
18 february 2017,aries,"You’re about to enter a wildly creative month ahead, thanks to the Sun entering the house that governs your subconscious mind. Inspiration could strike at any moment, so have a pad of paper or a recording device nearby. When Mercury join El Sol on the 25th your mojo will rise even more! It’s an excellent time for powering down your busy schedule and spending more quiet moments in reflection.

"
19 february 2017,aries,"The Moon in the most optimistic part of your chart is well aspected to Venus, planet of love. Are you ready to be more vulnerable or take a chance? Perhaps you and a lover just need to schedule some well-deserved down time and relax. Singles, both online dating and introductions from friends will work in your favor this week.

"
20 february 2017,aries,"Today is excellent for forging dynamic new connections, Aries. Spontaneous Uranus could prompt you to pick up the phone and reach out to someone who could become a friend or a promising business contact. Likewise, you could be at the receiving end of a call, text or e-mail from someone who views you as an interesting person to connect with. This energy continues through the end of the week, so by all means, network!

"
21 february 2017,aries,"You may need to reexamine the “terms” of a relationship, be it romantic or business, to ensure that you’re both heading in the same direction. The same holds true for group activities. Fortunately, a Mercury-Jupiter trine will make it easy to share your ideas and concerns with others. Do you share the same values or vision? Does everyone know what their duties are? Slow down and regroup.

"
22 february 2017,aries,"Tread warily around authority figures today as the planets warn that you could overstep your bounds–and the fallout won’t be pretty. Even if you’re a model of diplomacy it’s possible that someone else will be hell bent on winning some kind of power struggle that they want to generate. This is the time to count to ten and walk away.

"
23 february 2017,aries,"Speak your truth, Aries. A positive Mercury-Saturn aspect will enable you to get your point across to people, whether it’s your lover or the entire free world via the Internet.

"
24 february 2017,aries,"You’re about to enter a meditative period once Mercury changes signs over the weekend, but that doesn’t mean you need to cocoon yourself away from the world. A lively lunar aspect today tells you to call the tribe and make some plans for the weekend. Some pampering will do very nicely too, thanks to luxe Venus is your sign. Spa brunch, anyone?

"
25 february 2017,aries,"Go within. Intelligent Mercury enters your house of privacy, catharsis and and reflection.

The past two years may not have been easy, but this lunation is designed to put it all behind you.

"
27 february 2017,aries,"You’re in one feisty mood. Yesterday’s eclipse told you to put an end to things in your life that aren’t working, and you’re now taking it seriously. While it’s a smart move to go with what is  working, you run the risk of making rash decisions. Think before you go snip!!  You don’t have to clean house overnight.

"
28 february 2017,aries,"Feeling boxed in? You might be bristling at the feeling that other people or circumstances are holding you back, something that’s not going to sit well.

"
3 march 2017,aries,"Considering your options? You might be thinking about hunting down a new job or perhaps switching into a brand new industry. If so, the next week is super for putting out feelers and performing some quiet research. Take your time with this.

"
4 march 2017,aries,"Dig deep. Into your subconscious mind, that is! It’s time to start doing some inner work as Venus retrogrades over the next four weeks in your house of identity.

"
5 march 2017,aries,"An ambitious week awaits with energetic Mars active in your sign. Today is perfect for brainstorming sessions, and the best part is that you’ll be operating with as much logic as creativity. Ideas that hatch right now can end up with some serious long term potential.

"

A meeting of intelligent Mercury and the brilliant Sun in the most intuitive part of your chart bodes well for using your sixth sense–to your advantage.

"
7 march 2017,aries,"Look out for #1 today, Aries. No one is telling you to be selfish, but it’s wise to protect your personal boundaries and sense of contentment.

"

"
9 march 2017,aries,"Yee-ha! Mars enters your income sector, its first visit here in a long time. Get ready to shop your resume, dazzle the higher-ups or increase your company’s revenues. However, the money isn’t going to just magically appear. When Mars is in this sector your work load can increase significantly, as can expenses. Don’t spend it before you earn it and keep an eye on burnout.

"
10 march 2017,aries,"Inspiration flows with the Moon in artistic Leo winking at other orbs in innovative houses. Your ability to think in an original way, producing some visionary ideas while you’re at it, is quite strong today, Aries. Get ready to run with them once Mercury enters your sign on the 13th.

"
11 march 2017,aries,"With the Sun in the most sensitive part of your chart you could be feeling more emo than usual, perhaps insecure about what others think of you.

Where there’s a will there’s a way.

"
16 march 2017,aries,"With the Sun getting ready to enter your sign you should be wrapping up old projects and closing out difficult chapters from the past. You need to start making up your mind about some important things in the future, but from your chart it appears that you don’t have all the details. In addition you may be suffering from “kid in a candy shop” syndrome in which you simply can’t make up your mind! No worries. Take your time.

"
17 march 2017,aries,"Confusion may reign as to which direction to head in, courtesy of a tough Sun-Saturn square. It may be hard for you to accept but there are limitations on your time, patience and other resources. As a result, you may have to pick the most practical solution. Creating limits or standards for yourself and others is a smart way to go right now.

"
18 march 2017,aries,"Got your heart on your sleeve? It’s a sweet day to emote with a lovely Venus-Mercury meet up. Let someone know how you feel.

The decisions you make in the days ahead will have long term ramifications. Don’t rush the thinking–and the deciding–process.

"
20 march 2017,aries,"Happy birthday, Aries! Your special season begins, so get new plans in motion. This is the best time all year to work on solo endeavors and initiate important cycles.

"
21 march 2017,aries,"It’s your special time of year with the Sun in your sign, and no doubt you want to get moving with some terrific new plans and ideas. But trying to get other people to cooperate or collaborate today could be tricky, a theme that repeats itself in the next two weeks. But don’t let that slow you down. If need be, go solo and develop your own momentum.

"

"

"
25 march 2017,aries,"Damn, I look good—and I feel good too! A happy meet up of the Sun and sexy Venus should boost your self esteem, Aries.

You should start to feel more upbeat and confident as to what you can achieve in the year ahead. It’s a good day to speak your mind, especially with the people who are closest to you.

Sometimes it is  wise to play the role of the good sport, but you may need to stick up for your ideas or principles today.

"
31 march 2017,aries,"Cha-ching! if that’s a sound you’d like to hear, you’d better make haste, Aries. Clever Mercury buzzes into your income sector today, enabling you to self-promote, schedule meetings and research your options. However, the communications planet goes retrograde from April 20th until May 3rd. The good news is that motivator Mars is also in this part of the sky, egging you on to go after more dinero and stability.

"
1 april 2017,aries,"With the Sun and Venus in your sign, you’re undoubtedly dreaming of projects that you’d like to initiate over the next year. Finish coming up with that short list today as Venus retrogrades tomorrow back into Pisces, your twelfth house of closure. Between now and April 15th, slow down, do your research, and cut ties and habits that no longer serve you. Venus will then move forward, and so will your plans.

"
2 april 2017,aries,"Heal thyself. Venus retrogrades into your house of quiet reflection and letting go. Sit with yourself and acknowledge your true feelings.

"
5 april 2017,aries,"Getting in touch with your creative mojo gets a heck of a lot easier with a meeting of the two vibiest orbs–the Moon and Neptune.

Today is super for signing up for a class, hooking up with a mentor or just setting aside some quiet time for allowing the wisdom of the cosmos to come your way.

"
6 april 2017,aries,"Haste not only makes waste, but creates a sloppy presentation.

"

Likewise, keep an eye out for those who intend to schmooze you into a state of contented ignorance. Keep it real.

"
8 april 2017,aries,"Some BIG differences in opinion could arise between you and others, both in your personal and business lives. As a result someone may try to pull rank and gain control of the situation. Tread warily, Aries, as this could be a behind-the-scenes thing rather than a full frontal assault. You’ll need to balance your gut feelings along with your logical reasoning in order to figure this out.

"
9 april 2017,aries,"Start to live a little leaner over the next few weeks, Aries—Mercury is retrograding in your cash and income sector. Raises, promotions, new jobs and fertile revenue streams could slow down between now and the 20th. However, there is a bright side. An old boss or colleague could contact you with a job offer. It’s also an excellent time to review your bank accounts, client base and revenues to see where you can make improvements. Sound habits and routines are found here, so switch up your methods of getting things done.

"

19 april 2017,aries,"Now that the Sun is in the income sector of your chart you can make headway when it comes to pulling in more dinero. But you won’t get far if you push up against people in positions of authority. Aim for diplomacy (not brown nosing).

The next few weeks are super for socializing and making a good impression, whether you want to meet the neighbors, find a new honey or connect with decision makers who can advance your career. Just watch the tendency to be pushy or way too focused on your own agenda. You can make a lot of headway but other people will be a big part of your success and happiness.

"
22 april 2017,aries,"Get real about romance as love planet Venus is in a tough angle to serious Saturn. Placing someone on a pedestal? Assuming that this is “The One”—after only two dates?

But you need to maintain a logical viewpoint in order to get there.

Chances are this person will be a soulful type, not flashy or dramatic, but who needs more drama, anyway?

27 april 2017,aries,"Yesterday’s new moon in your income sector has opened up a six month period of wonderful opportunity. However, you’re not going to be able to do this all on your own—people in positions of authority will be influential in your success. Today a superb Moon-Pluto aspect allows you to make the big ask or the hot presentation. Since Pluto is retrograde, key decision makers may be slower than usual to respond, but that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t showcase your talents.

"
28 april 2017,aries,"Second time is a charm? Luxe Venus enters Aries for the second time this year, blessing your sign with another opportunity to get things right! This is especially true of romance, since Venus is the planet of love. But you can also make headway with personal projects, such as a diet, makeover or pursuing a big dream: going back to university, starting a business, traveling around the world or writing a book. Innovative Uranus is active, putting outrageous new ideas in your head. But what’s wrong with that?

"
29 april 2017,aries,"If you don’t have anything nice to say about someone, don’t say it. Remember that old warning from Mom? It holds true with a stern Moon-Saturn opposition. As a matter of fact, you may want to keep all of your opinions to yourself today, whether they’re about politics, the state of the economy or just about any topic, no matter how innocuous it may seem.  People take offense easily under current planetary aspects.

"
30 april 2017,aries,"Take some time out today to do a little “family planning”. No, this doesn’t mean birth control or timing the arrival of your next baby! This is a financial activity in which you ensure that there’s going to be enough money in the future for buying real estate, paying for college, covering medical bills, helping out an elderly parent and the like. Singles should be paying close attention to their retirement and investment portfolios. Do it now and thank yourself later.

"
1 may 2017,aries,"Don’t cage me in! That may be your battle cry as the Moon squares Uranus. If people close to you start laying on the demands, chances are you’re going to give them a piece of your mind. But they ain’t seen nothing yet. Wait until Wednesday when Mercury goes direct in Aries. Then you’ll be locked and loaded.

"
2 may 2017,aries,"Energetic Mars is tearing through your house of thinking, causing all sorts of bright ideas to bubble to the surface.

Solo endeavors can take off, and with the Sun in your second house of creating routines and stability, you can dive right in and do things right.

"
4 may 2017,aries,"You may need to adjust your expectations of others, Aries. While you’d love to assume that everyone in your circle is on the same page as you (and just as motivated), the planets indicate otherwise. This doesn’t mean that you should let anyone slide or take advantage of you; it simply means that you need to keep an eye on folks and prod them gently. Tomorrow is a better day to lay down the law.

"
5 may 2017,aries,"Your dignity is rising, thanks to the mighty Sun in the part of your chart that allows you to see yourself in a brand new light. And this means that you don’t have to be someone’s doormat, enabler, or go-to gal or guy.

6 may 2017,aries,"Reality check! Moon-Saturn square tells you to snap out of wishful thinking, wherever it may be taking you: your finances, weight, love life, career, you name it. But you’re fortunate, Aries, in that logical Saturn is currently transiting the most daring part of your chart. You can  make things happen, but that’s the key. They’re not going to arrive magically on your door step. Daily action is required.

"
7 may 2017,aries,"Passion is a fabulous thing when focused in the right direction, and today you can do just that. A vibey Moon-Jupiter connection allows you to zero in on the people and things that would make you the most happy. But it may be time to reframe what’s important to you, as inspirational Neptune tells you to take a second look.

"
8 may 2017,aries,"A strong independent streak is building inside, Aries, making you question just how badly you want to remain within a certain union or group. It could be a romance, volunteer organization, job or with acquaintances. Whatever the connection may be, your emotions could be running high—along with your mouth. But that’s fine! Sometimes people need to hear the truth about what you think and feel.

9 may 2017,aries,"Someone influential may be able to pull some strings for you thanks to power broker Pluto in a good spot today. It’s also an auspicious time to make presentations to big prospects or potential employers. And with the Sun in your house of earnings, the initiatives that you get started within the next few days could pay off quite nicely.

"
10 may 2017,aries,"Are you in or are you out? The full moon asks you just how comfortable you are in a romantic union. Unhappy? Then you might decide to bolt, especially if you’ve been feeling hemmed in, unable to be your true self within the relationship. A spunky Mercury-Uranus aspect will fire up your desire to go. But if you’re happy in love, then this lunation could spur rapid advancement to a higher level: an engagement, moving in together or having a baby. Singles. a soulmate is on the horizon. Just don’t jump in too quickly.

"
12 may 2017,aries,"What’s your rush? If you want to find a new lover or become more committed to an existing amour, today’s an excellent time to talk things over. It’s also stellar for singles to find a keeper. But don’t push too hard too fast, a possibility with aggressive Mars in your communication sector. Strong (and profitable) business alliances can be formed too, so consider who might be a worthwhile partner or mentor.

"
13 may 2017,aries,"You may need to revise your finances, Aries. Current planetary aspects recommend examining your budget for leaks or waste. Self-employed? Then take a look at your revenue streams. Perhaps you need to toss one and replace it with another that has more potential. This exercise is especially important when it comes to the bigger expenses, such as college for the kids, your retirement or buying a place. Serious Saturn demands that if you want to fund the larger projects that you start saving now.

15 may 2017,aries,"OK, put on your ripped sweatshirts, get into Flashdance  mode and sing along with me: “Take your passion, and make it happen….bein’s believin’, I can have it all, I’m dancing for my life”. Too young to remember that movie? Then you need to watch it, because its message is the same message that the cosmos has for your sign today: find what you’re passionate about and make it your career. Can’t afford to do that? Then figure out a way to do it on the side, to weave it into your daily existence.

"
16 may 2017,aries,"Time to feng shui your life? Your desire to simplify your habits, home and work flow should increase now that Mercury is in Taurus.

17 may 2017,aries,"Getting people to go along with your ideas and plans may become easier, as the Moon in the friendliest part of your chart helps you get your point across.

"
18 may 2017,aries,"Hosting Venus in your sign is terrific for feeling better about yourself, whether it’s on a physical level or a mental one. Making over your hair, wardrobe, physique and attitude are all highly favored right now. Just remember that self-esteem comes from within though. Don’t hold your dignity and self respect hostage to the opinions of others. If you’re doing inner and outer “work” on yourself, make sure that you’re doing it primarily for you.

"
19 may 2017,aries,"Rebel, rebel! A rare aspect occurs as maverick Uranus, the cosmos’s rule breaker, aligns with Saturn, the strict task master. This is actually a good thing, considering that the ringed planet is in your sector of visionary thinking. This means that you can make sweeping changes without doing anything too foolish. Start with yourself, as Uranus is in Aries. Sometimes if we adjust our attitude the rest of the world catches on that we’ve changed somehow, and they end up treating us better as a result.

The Sun enters the chattiest part of your chart today, setting up a four-week period in which you can schmooze, flirt, strategize and clink cocktail glasses with your pals. Just be mindful as to what you say and the people with whom you share important information as there are some dicey days ahead, such as the 25th (new moon!) and the 29th. Otherwise you’re in a super place to enjoy strategic work sessions with like-minded people, socialize and express yourself brilliantly through any media: blogging, art, music, writing or videos.

"
21 may 2017,aries,"Lovely lunar aspect helps you open up the lines of communication with loved ones, which doesn’t just mean serious convos.

"
22 may 2017,aries,"Your self esteem gets a big boost as magnetic Venus meets up with the Moon in your sign, Aries! You deserve to feel happy about yourself, and it’s a good time to start showing off the goods, so to speak. Socializing and a little shameless self-promotion are in order but make sure that you don’t go overboard. Not everyone will share your viewpoint or enthusiasm, which is fine–you don’t need their approval.

"
23 may 2017,aries,"In order to earn more you may need to learn more first. Planning an exciting vacation? Do as much homework as you can. The same goes for researching colleges, a new neighborhood to live in, or the insiders’ techniques to starting a blog or business venture. Glossing over details is not a smart move these days, and with go-go-go Mars in your house of thinking, it’s an easy mistake to make. Slow down and allow yourself time to do things the right way.

"
24 may 2017,aries,"Want to see more green in your wallet, more responsibility or kudos for a job well done? Then step up to the plate and get ready to hit the ball out of the park. A lunar aspect is auspicious for impressing higher ups. If you feel as though someone in a position of authority is holding you back, it’s not wise to confront them, nor to kiss up. Find a way around them instead.

"
26 may 2017,aries,"If criticism comes your way from someone, just let it pass. What people often say or do is more about them than it is about you. Fortunately, from your chart it appears that you will bounce back from this quickly, with the attitude of “life is too short to worry about this.” Amen.

"
27 may 2016,aries,"The squeaky wheel gets greased? The recent new moon in your talkative third house tells you to make your voice heard. But this can often be done in subtler ways than speech. The way you write, the manner in which you strategize and your body language are all ways to reach out to the world with your message. Developing a brand or a promotional effort? Then put a lot of effort into graphics, copy writing, smart social media tactics. Take your time with this as stern Saturn warns against rushing.

"
29 may 2017,aries,"What you may perceive as witty banter or stimulating conversation may be viewed by others as opinionated bloviating. Watch what you say today, Aries, as megamouth Mars is off and running in your house of conversation and thinking. It opposes Saturn, and the ringed planet will not  be amused by idle chatter, ranting or oversharing. Take a vow of silence for the day.

"
30 may 2017,aries,"It’s a great day for a fresh start, especially if you’re interested in changing the way you present yourself to the world. This just isn’t the obvious stuff, like hair and makeup and clothing. How about the way you speak, or write? Are you perceived as being an innovative thinker or just another cog in the wheel? Innovative Uranus is firing you up to turn your self-image or personal brand into something sensational.

"
31 may 2017,aries,"You’re usually not the shy and retiring type, but even a bold ram can find their self-worth taking a hit from time to time. Fortunately your dignity and confidence get a boost today from a Mercury-Pluto connection that will raise your spirits. let the past define the future?

That’s because vivacious Venus in your sign is spurring you to get off your duff and start taking some intelligent, calculated risks. You may not be able to control what other people are going to do or say, but you certainly have power over your own decisions and activities.

"
1 june 2016,aries,"There’s an old saying: if you can’t win them with words, baffle them with bulls***. And you, Aries, have to have your BS meter up and running today, as you could be at the receiving end of it. A tough square between the Sun and Neptune could create a situation in which you are being forthright and open, yet others around you are not. So you can lay all your cards on the table and show your hand, but the other party may have a trick up their sleeve. Stay on your toes.

2 june 2017,aries,"Your ideas have a lot of power these days as the mighty Sun is stoking the most intellectual part of your chart. Whether you want to win over a potential lover, employer or committee, a sparkling Sun-Jupiter aspect will put the right words in your mind—and then into your mouth or on paper. Partnering with others can be the best way to go these days, considering that lucky Jupiter is in your house of collaborations. And yes, that does include love!

"
2 june 2016,aries,"Finally! All the hard work you’ve been doing may start to pay off, thanks to a positive angle between the Moon and the North Node. There is a highly karmic vibe to this, as if the cosmos is getting ready to reward you. But it’s wise to keep on plugging away quietly without calling attention to yourself. Neptune in the most secretive part of your chart is in a good angle, providing you with an extra dollop of inspiration from the shadows.

"
3 june 2017,aries,"Whoa!!! What just happened? That’s what you may be thinking today as erratic Uranus stirs things up. You may decide that you’ve had enough of someone’s shenanigans and tell them to hit the road. Likewise, you could blurt out your hidden admiration (lust, love, whatever) to another. Your emotions could be going all over the map and God only knows what Aries is going to do next. But this could also bring about a life-affirming “Eureka!” moment in which you realize that it’s time to push yourself past previous limiting circumstances.

"

Cribbing Dorothy Gale’s line, “there’s no place like home”, you may feel more like nesting in your abode rather than going out on the town over the next four weeks. If you do go out you might be heading to the Container Store or Bed, Bath and Beyond in an effort to turn your place into a more stylish and organized home. Talks about moving in with a lover or starting a family could come up, so get ready for changes on the home front.

"
5 june 2017,aries,"Dust off the old BS meter and set it for “high”. Might as well get out the hip waders while you’re at it, it could be deep today. Just make sure that it’s not coming from your end! Be a straight shooter, even if others aren’t. Turn on your Spidey sense and dig deep into what others are saying or doing. Don’t be obvious about it: use your intuition to your advantage.

"
6 june 2017,aries,"Stability. We all crave it, and now it’s time for you to grab on to it and hold it tight. That’s because sweet Venus, planet of love (and profits!), moves into grounded Taurus. Whether you’re searching for guarantees in romance or your career, the next few weeks are excellent for putting your foot down and demanding them. But you won’t have to yell or be aggressive: this is more about being the iron hand in the velvet glove.

7 june 2017,aries,"You’re in brainiac mode this week as a full moon takes place Friday in the lofty, philosophical ninth house. This is where we think big, on a conceptual level. It’s as if we’re standing on a mountaintop and can see the sprawling vista of our lives from a unique vantage point. And today intelligent Mercury enters the other  house of thinking, the highly strategic third house. No matter what challenges you’re facing you’re now in an awesome spot to figure out solutions.

"
8 june 2017,aries,"How you relate to others could use a little tweaking, Aries! A more gentle, subdued manner is the best way to communicate with, be it verbally or in writing. Your ability to intuit what people are thinking is excellent, not to mention reading their body language for subtle cues. Pay closer attention to what others say rather than doing all of the talking.

"
9 june 2017,aries,"Big day in the cosmos as a full moon illuminates your forward thinking house of coloring outside the lines! If life has been way too predictable it’s time to shake things up with some changes, which may include a more optimistic attitude. Even though this is known as the house of risk taking, practical Saturn is in a good angle, ensuring that you don’t do anything too stupid. By all means, take a chance—on love, starting your own business, changing your look or traveling around the world. You may be wrapping up a number of other projects, so finish them so that you can move on to some juicier stuff.

"
10 june 2017,aries,"Relief at last! Mighty Jupiter has just resumed direct motion in your relationship sector after a four-month nap. Singles, you may have stayed away from love or found it difficult to make progress within a dating situation. Couples may have been overloaded with work demands and stress, unable to spend quality time together. Fortunately this period is over, and as Jupiter is the planet of abundance and optimism, you can expect matters of the heart to develop momentum.

"
11 june 2017,aries,"You’re in a playful mood, and why not? Spontaneous Uranus is urging you to do something enjoyable today. Indulge in a hobby, take on a new sport, go to a movie or try a new restaurant. Life is short–get out there and enjoy it!

"
12 june 2017,aries,"You know the saying: karma can be a b****. But today it could also be your best friend! You don’t have to settle in love, nor should you. It appears from your chart that the cosmos is ready to bless you with some overdue goodies when it comes to matters of the heart. It could mean conceiving a baby, finding a soulmate or realizing how much someone loves you. I suppose you also might hear that your ex is now living a life of hell with his/her new “love”. Silently wish them well and move on with your fab life!

"
13 june 2017,aries,"A battle could erupt among key players in your life, whether that means people in the office or a loved one. It looks like someone has their bossy pants on and wants to stir up trouble (hopefully that’s not you….but it could be!). Don’t lose your sense of optimism or take things they say to heart. With intelligent Mercury in your thinking sector you should be able to see right through what’s going on.

"
14 june 2017,aries,"Great day for researching or launching an online endeavor: Etsy store, website, social media campaign, coding an app, you name it. Saturn, the planet that builds strength into any situation it’s involved in, is sparkling in your visionary ninth house of going global. Group efforts can also gain momentum, so lead the charge and get everyone thinking about new ways of approaching your end goal.

"
15 june 2017,aries,"Don’t make promises you can’t keep! You may be overly optimistic about what you can deliver, Aries. From your chart it appears that more thought and planning needs to go into something of interest to you. With Neptune about to retrograde, remaining logical is going to be a main priority for you over the next five months.

"
16 june 2017,aries,"Keeping things real is going to be a major focus for you over the next five months, Aries! Dreamy Neptune begins to retrograde in your highly emotional twelfth house, the place where daydreams and fantasies reside. As a result you could indulge in escapist thinking—not a good thing. Also, don’t kid yourself about health issues or habits that aren’t good for you. This can be an incredibly inspirational time, though, if you channel your mind the right way.

"
17 june 2017,aries,"Cleanse your soul of past dramas and hurts. A cathartic Moon-Chiron aspect will work wonders for your psyche, and as Chiron is the wounded healer, it’s time to toss out old mindsets that no longer work for you. There is no dignity in being a martyr, unless you’re Joan of Arc or a biblical figure. Personally, I’d rather not get burned at the stake.

"
18 june 2017,aries,"Great day to call someone close and go out for brunch, head to the beach, have cocktails or trawl some art galleries. Spontaneity rules with unpredictable Uranus in a happy mood. Save your chores for another day.

"
19 june 2017,aries,"Unless you’re absolutely sure about something, don’t say anything. A harsh Mercury-Saturn aspect warns you to be circumspect about statements you make, along with any promises on your part. Signing a legal contract? All the more reason to be careful. Get more background information before you put your signature on paper.

"
20 june 2017,aries,"Sometimes it seems to take forever for wisdom to sink in; other times it can happen in the blink of an eye. A sparkling Mercury-Uranus aspect today allows for a sudden flash of understanding to occur, something that can help you enormously. Over the next four weeks your desire to feel content and balanced is going to increase. Considering that these two planets govern genius thoughts, you’re in a terrific spot to move ahead.

"
21 june 2017,aries,"Enjoying a happy home life will become more important to you in the weeks ahead, Aries. This is true even if you live alone. It’s an excellent time to discuss matters with family members now that the Sun and verbal Mercury have just entered your emotional, sensitive domestic sector. No need for drama—calm logic will work just fine, thank you.

"
22 june 2017,aries,"Why are you holding things in? Now that verbal Mercury is in one of the most sensitive and emotional parts of your chart, the time is ripe for letting people know what you’re thinking—and how you feel. Reach out and touch someone.

"
23 june 2017,aries,"Your self confidence and sense of contentment will get a boost as the Moon swings past the Sun and Mercury. Tomorrow’s new moon is designed to help you feel more secure in all areas of your life, so get ready for a six-month period in which you can start viewing the world through a happier lens.

"
24 june 2017,aries,"It’s time to create more comfort and stability in your life, something that can occur far easier than you may think. Today’s new moon falls in your security conscious fourth house, the place where we seek a more peaceful life. A profitable Venus-Pluto aspect is designed to bring in more dinero through a higher paying job, a raise or increased business revenues. Singles could find a keeper, someone who’s established financially with a mature attitude. All of this can happen over the next six months…a great way to close out 2017!

"
25 june 2017,aries,"Sometimes it’s better to keep personal information just that–personal. People around you may feel as though they’re entitled to know all of the details of your life, but the more they know the more they can interfere. Unless you want a lot of unsolicited opinions, keep some things to yourself.

"
26 june 2017,aries,"There are times to keep your emotions in check and times when you should be openly expressing them. A helpful Mars-Neptune aspect encourages you to speak up and get everything out there. By the same token, someone close may need to vent, so be a good listener and keep their remarks confidential. Neptune is active in your house of privacy.

"
26 june 2016,aries,"Hitch your wagon upon a star! Think long and hard about whom you could connect with or impress, as the contacts you make right now could carry your career forward for years to come. A powerful Pluto-Jupiter trine could bring them in. This planetary event won’t happen again until 2024 so don’t take it lightly.

"
27 june 2017,aries,"Is martyrdom your thing? How about being a doormat, an enabler or a victim? No, you say? Good. Intelligent Mercury is knocking some sense into your head about just how much nonsense you should be putting up with. Very little, in fact.

"
27 june 2016,aries,"“I’m bringing sexy back.”  That’s your song o’ the day, Aries, as lusty Mars finally moves direct in your house of libido and intimacy! And with Mercury moving into your domestic zone, it’s time for some canoodling at home. You don’t need to head off to a swank hotel or a romantic B & B for amour; just make your pad more posh and luxe. Satin sheets, anyone?

"
28 june 2017,aries,"Need to get something off your chest? Today’s the day to do so with a powerful Mercury/Mars conjunction. They meet in your fourth house, the place where we crave contentment and stability. Resolve matters as best you can with family members or even an ex. This is no time to hope that things will improve on their own. Take ownership of a problem and let people know exactly how you feel.

"
28 june 2016,aries,"The Moon in your sign is stirring you up, telling you that you need to pay attention to making your life more streamlined and stress-free. Sometimes you just have to let go of the “big picture”, the five-year plan, and just worry about today. The better you handle your daily chores and assignments, the easier it will be to achieve the bigger plans.

"
29 june 2017,aries,"Someone may come on strong, therefore undermining your sense of security or feeling of contentment. You may be tempted to defend yourself or try to reason with this person, but you’ll only be wasting your breath. Let it slide. You have such awesome planetary aspects for finding peace and happiness that you can’t let someone else’s problems influence your experience of the day.

"
29 june 2016,aries,"Don’t be surprised if you do a complete 180 today, especially when it comes to your career. On a grand scale, you could decide to chuck it all and run off to join the circus (metaphorically speaking). Or you could simply decide to take your company in a new direction, going online instead of brick and mortar. You could set your cap on a different kind of client or change up the way you do presentations. The good news is that your ideas hold promise.

"
30 june 2017,aries,"Don’t assume that a loved one knows how you feel about them. With the Moon in a passionate, expressive place today, verbalize your feelings. However, this isn’t the right time to push for an answer or for someone to make a decision. Wait until after the 4th of July.

"
30 june 2016,aries,"How much control do you need to give up in order to be happy in a relationship with another human being? Whether it’s work, love or a friendship, today’s planetary aspects will ask you that question. Some people are better at flying solo than others and chafe under restrictions. Others need more reassurance and a strong hand to guide them. With the recent full moon in the most independent part of your chart, chances are you’re craving more freedom.

"
1 july 2017,aries,"Changing the rules of your romance is on the cosmos’s agenda today. Perhaps you need to spend more time with your lover, or household duties need to be divvied up more evenly. Singles, maybe you need to revise your opinion about who the perfect person is. Once charismatic Venus enters Gemini on the 4th it will be far easier to make this happen.

"
1 july 2016,aries,"Despite the fact that the weekend is upon us, the cosmos is getting ready to deliver some goodies to you in the form of better working conditions, higher pay or juicier assignments. You’re going to have to seek them out–they won’t just fall into your lap–but if you’re willing to put in the effort, you’ll get the results. This energy carries out well onto mid-July, and the end game is to provide you with greater security and peace of mind.

"
2 july 2017,aries,"Who’s wearing their bossy pants today? As stubborn Mars opposes subterranean Pluto, someone could have quite the attitude–hopefully not you. It’s also possible that your work load is getting to you, making you feel as though you’ll never be able to spare enough time for your own personal pursuits or your family. This energy will reappear again later in July, so be prepared to work through it.

"
2 july 2016,aries,"Planetary influences indicate that some long overdue changes need to be made in your family or personal relationships, and that now is the time to address them. The good news is that a new moon on Monday in this part of the sky will help you take care of issues and lay them to rest, once and for all.

"
3 july 2017,aries,"Taking care of family matters may be first and foremost in your mind as the Sun and Mars both blaze a path through your domestic fourth house. Today’s a smart time to speak your piece as aspects later in the week could make communication difficult. Someone may be digging in their heels, and chances are it’s not you. With gentle Venus about to enter Gemini your level of diplomacy will only increase.

"
3 july 2016,aries,"You’re more than ready to dump dramas from the past, especially where your family is concerned. Daddy issues, mommy meltdowns, whacked out siblings–it’s time to let it all go, and the helpful trine today between the Sun and Neptune will get things rolling. Tomorrow’s new moon in your domestic sector will get the ball rolling.

"
4 july 2017,aries,"Life should get a lot sweeter and more sociable now that charismatic Venus is in your house of mingling with others. You can use this friendly energy in any way you please: to catch up with old friends, play with your kids, find a new lover (face to face beats online) or schmooze some industry contacts. Venus will be here til the 31st, so get out there and enjoy yourself.

"
4 july 2016,aries,"With two upbeat planets moving through the sky supporting today’s new moon in Cancer, a new chapter opens up that can bring you much joy and contentment. Saturn is in fine angle, promising that if you put effort into your dreams, that you will be able to achieve them. It won’t happen overnight, and you’ll have to work hard, but success can be yours…and the peace of mind that accompanies it.

"
5 july 2017,aries,"Don’t pay attention to what people say–pay attention to what they do. Your intuition is in fine form, enabling you to see past the smoke screens that others may have up. It’s not so much that people are trying to deceive you, but rather they’re being unrealistic or are ill informed.

"
5 july 2016,aries,"If you have to work out an issue with a parent or older relative, Mercury is in your corner. Use your intuition to help guide you through the situation, as it should be strong. You may not have been getting the full story, but with today’s aspects you should be able to get to the bottom of the matter.

"
6 july 2017,aries,"You may need to be the person who takes ownership of a family, love or housing issue, thanks to the Sun in your serenity-driven fourth house. You’re in no mood these days for endless dramas that seem to drag on, and the people in your world need to figure that out. They will, too–at the time of this Saturday’s full moon in Capricorn, which takes place in your house of authority.

"
7 july 2017,aries,"People could have advice for you, and if that’s the case you would be wise to take heed. Some of it may be just what you need to hear right now. Your intuition is strong, thanks to vibey Neptune in the house of the subconscious mind, but it certainly won’t hurt to get another opinion.

"
7 july 2016,aries,"Who’s the boss? Two oppositions and a square today pit your sense of contentment and security against people around you who seem to want to run the show. Be careful that you don’t erupt in anger or frustration, as unpredictable Uranus could push your buttons. And the reality is that you may have to deal with a supervisor (not a power-hungry wannabe) who is critical and on edge. Let it slide, because things improve on Friday.

"
8 july 2017,aries,"The full moon in Capricorn raises your profile and lends you prestige, Aries. And why not? You’ve been working hard and you deserve it. This lunation could bring a project to a successful finale, and be a turning point for fulfilling new ambitions that pop into your head.

"
8 july 2016,aries,"Something could happen today that will make you feel more contented about your work environment. Perhaps the office diva gets canned, or the boss gives you better technological tools to work with. A client could praise your work or your resume could land on just the right desk. Whatever it is, you’re moving into a period of greater security. But it won’t happen all by itself—you will be actively engaged in this process.

"
9 july 2017,aries,"Family responsibilities may be weighing on you, and frustration may be mounting as you try to balance work and personal demands. Truth be told, this vibe will continue as the month goes on, reoccurring on the 17th and the 20th. Work your way through it, Aries, because relief (and fun!) arrives on the 20th when Mars roars into frisky, life-affirming Leo.

"
9 july 2016,aries,"Feeling fine! An optimistic Moon-Jupiter angle bodes well for an improvement in vitality and fitness. With so many planets in your domestic fourth house, cocooning at home is what the doctor orders, along with eating healthier foods and working out. Tearing around the neighborhood on errands and putting in late hours at the job have to be scaled back.

"
10 july 2017,aries,"Touchy! The slightest remark could set you off with a Sun-Pluto opposition. Chances are you’ve been working hard, too hard, and you need some down time. That said, if someone is coming on too strong with an inappropriate remark you may need to set them in their place.

"
10 july 2016,aries,"With the Sun in Cancer and aligning with Jupiter in Virgo, this is a great time to make progress around the house and garden. While beautifying your surroundings makes for a more enjoyable environment, don’t overlook the peace of mind that comes from having organized drawers and closets!

"
11 july 2017,aries,"Getting other people to support your ideas gets easier today thanks to a happy Moon-Jupiter trine. Better yet is that they may decide to get on board with you, so you’ll be able to move forward with a partner rather than going it all alone.

"
11 july 2016,aries,"Wrap up any home or family related dramas or disputes, as communicative Mercury is getting ready to move on to another part of your chart. Whether it’s a problem with a parent, kid, contractor, roommate, real estate agent or landlord, try to settle it now. This issue could reappear on Saturday. Who needs the agita?

"
12 july 2017,aries,"Slow down a bit today and give more thought to where you’re heading. The recent full moon was in your g0-go-go house of ambition, but rushing in without enough intel could screw things up. You also need time for your creative juices to start flowing, which they will, thanks to Mercury in your house of talent.

"
12 july 2016,aries,"Summer is here and the living is easy! That’s your motto over the next five weeks, Aries, as planets start gliding into Leo, the sign of fun, frolic and luxury. Fortunately for you, love planet Venus goes there today, stirring up your desire to dazzle, laugh and mingle. Single rams could find new love and committed ones could enter into a flirty new phase. Oh, and by the way—the stork could visit too! Plan accordingly.

"
13 july 2017,aries,"Need inspiration? Then go within, Aries, as a dynamic Moon-Neptune meeting stirs up your creative juices. It can also stir up your passion and, uh, other  juices so if you’re feeling amorous….get a room!

"
13 july 2016,aries,"We’re all communicating, whether we realize it or not. The way we dress, speak and carry ourselves speaks volumes. Even the most casual conversations reveal who we are. Well, expressive Mercury enters the most creative part of your chart today, urging you to present yourself in a more innovative manner. Whether it’s term papers, business reports, your blog or your wardrobe, start jazzing things up a little bit.

"
14 july 2017,aries,"Where is this relationship going? It’s time for one of those talks and optimistic Jupiter has your back. Naturally this kind of chat can occur in a romance, but today’s cosmic energy is also auspicious for asking the same question in a business alliance.

"
14 july 2016,aries,"Deep emotions could bubble to the surface as spontaneous Uranus and aggressive Mars meet in the heavens. You have a choice: get angry over past hurts and dramas, or release them. The angle between these two orbs suggests that you reframe your thinking, taking on a different viewpoint. Sometimes that’s all it takes.

"
15 july 2017,aries,"Your intuition will be spot on today, so don’t be afraid to use it. With Mars lighting up your house of family and close relationships, your inner wisdom can help you figure out what’s going on in the mind of a relative, roommate or lover.

"
15 july 2016,aries,"Long-term plans get a boost today from a Moon-Saturn meetup. While La Luna provides you with the passion to put into your dreams, Saturn makes sure that you don’t cross over into Lala Land with crazy schemes that won’t pan out.

"
16 july 2017,aries,"Playing nice with everyone, just to keep the peace, won’t be in the cosmic picture today, Aries! As the Moon forms a tight angle with rebellious Uranus, you’re going to be interested in taking care of #1. Nothing wrong with that! It’s about time.

"
16 july 2016,aries,"Temper, temper! Combustable Uranus flares up in your self-esteem sector, making you sensitive to the words and antics of others. No problem though. A confident Mercury-Venus meetup will allow you to vent in a constructive manner, especially where kids or a lover are involved. Count to ten, breathe, then calmly state your position.

"
17 july 2017,aries,"Touchy! Watch your temper (and your words) as you appear to be a bit thin skinned today. The slightest provocation from someone could set you off, so count to ten and chill out. Tomorrow is a better time for communication.

"
17 july 2016,aries,"Intense emotions could bubble to the surface, but this is beneficial. A happy trine between Mars and Chiron, the wounded healer, is encouraging you to get to the root of unease, face fears and acknowledge your true feelings. Tuesday’s full moon in the most take-charge part of your chart will help you step into your own power.

"
18 july 2017,aries,"Great day to get your point across, especially if you need the cooperation of others. Venus is not only the planet of love but the planet of profits, and it’s winking at optimistic Jupiter across the heavens. You can score big in both romance and business.

"
18 july 2016,aries,"Since most of us spend the majority of our waking hours working for a living, what we do—and how much we enjoy it—is of paramount importance. A Pluto-Moon convo will find you thinking long and hard about your level of contentment. If you’re working at a soul-sucking job, or you’re unemployed, tomorrow’s full moon in your ambition sector sets the stage for change. Relatively happy? Then you can make incredible progress in the six months ahead.

"
19 july 2017,aries,"Need to seal a deal? Whether you’re applying for a mortgage, asking someone out on a date or showing your art portfolio to a gallery owner, today’s cosmic energy rocks for putting together a long-term, happy arrangement.

"
19 july 2016,aries,"Got ambition? If so, tonight’s full moon will out a smile on your face. It falls in your house of success and kudos and is wonderfully supported by Saturn. The ringed planet’s presence indicates that whatever you work on now will have ramifications for years to come, so choose wisely. Whether you change companies, take on a new leadership position or go the entrepreneurial route, you’ll come out a winner.

"
20 july 2017,aries,"Purrrrr, pussy cat! Lusty Mars enters Leo, your fifth house of romance and enjoying the sweeter things in life. Singles can find new love and coupled up Aries can savor some juicier date nights (and boudoir activities). The Sun is just about to join Mars, so between these two you should really enjoy the month ahead.

"
20 july 2016,aries,"You’re the envy of the zodiac, Aries, with romantic Venus in the house of love! And the Sun heads into the same spot on Friday. If you’ve been looking for love in all the wrong places, or your current relationship is lackluster, today’s powerful Venus-Saturn trine is all about finding love that lasts, with an exciting edge to it. Security in romance does not have to mean “boring”–keep that in mind.

"
21 july 2017,aries,"What you want and what others around you are hoping for may be two different things today. Feeling pressured into playing along with someone else’s agenda could bring out a rebellious streak. But before you flip out, ask yourself if there is any merit to what others are up to.

"
21 july 2016,aries,"The best way to get things done right now is through team effort. Agree with another mom to babysit your kids while you run errands, join a marathon training group, bring in consultants or mentors at the office. Not only will you become more efficient, you’ll free up time for fun–a bonus, considering that the Sun enters frisky Leo tomorrow!

"
22 july 2017,aries,"A fabulous new chapter is about to open in romance, thanks to the fiery Sun gliding into Leo today. Over the next four weeks you can enjoy the company of not only a lover but your kids too, as they are part of this sector. But don’t forget to take care of #1 with some well-earned pampering, a Leo specialty.

"
22 july 2016,aries,"Sweet! The Sun enters your house of love, down time and creativity. It joins Mercury and Venus, which are already trying to bring more romance and inspiration your way. With dreamy Neptune in your mysterious twelfth house, chances are you’re day dreaming about the kind of love and life you want to enjoy. Take those dreams and run with them.

"
23 july 2017,aries,"Just how happy do you want to be? The new moon in Leo, your house of romance and enjoying life, can  kick open up a wonderful phase. But Uranus is acting up in your house of self. What’s the matter–do you think you don’t deserve the good things in life? Guess again!

"
23 july 2016,aries,"Hey there, mind reader. A powerful Moon-Neptune conjunction helps you suss out what’s going on in the head of a lover or child. This has a positive vibe around it that lasts into the week ahead. Wednesday is particularly good for communicating with someone close to you.

"
24 july 2017,aries,"Reaching an agreement about long term dreams or goals could be difficult today. Likewise, you may discover that someone in your personal or business world doesn’t share the same values. Thursday and Friday are much better days to get on the same page–if that’s a possibility.

"
24 july 2016,aries,"Your passion for life should be apparent today, thanks to the Moon entering Aries. It forms a glorious angle with the Sun, telling you to schedule in more quality time for love, hobbies, sports, and attending cultural events. The Sun is now in your house of living purposefully and creatively. It’s up to you to make it happen!

"
25 july 2017,aries,"It’s time to get your act together, whether that means sticking to a diet for real this time or finally getting your work flow at the office under control. Fortunately, smart little Mercury has your back for the next five weeks. Use its energy to streamline, simplify and then chill out.

"
25 july 2016,aries,"Ouch! Watch what you say to a person in a place of authority, as a tough Moon-Pluto square could make you say something you’ll regret. This holds true not only for verbal statements, but anything you put in writing. This is not the day to troll, rant or tell the cop who just pulled you over that you’re paying his salary. If you need to talk to the boss, wait until tomorrow or Wednesday.

"
26 july 2017,aries,"Go for it! A powerful meet up of the Sun and Mars tells you to let your freak flag fly. Ask someone out on a date, dye your hair red, sign up for art classes, flirt outrageously and go window shopping for a brand new look. Super day for finding new love, rekindling an existing romance or conceiving a baby!

"
26 july 2016,aries,"Recent events may have found you in “should I stay or should I go” mode when it comes to your career. Today, the Moon forms a benevolent angle with mutable Pluto, stirring up thoughts about your financial security and income level. If you want to see change, it can happen.

"
27 july 2017,aries,"It’s time to get real about a relationship issue, and now that the Moon is in your house of serious alliances you can. There’s a fine line between living purely on passion and maintaining a practical viewpoint. Make sure that you’re listening to your head as much as your heart.

"
27 july 2016,aries,"A bold Uranus-Mercury trine is going to encourage you to speak up in matters of the heart. Singles, you may be ready to take a chance again in love. Hiding in the shadows never helped anyone, Aries! Seek out the happiness you crave and deserve.

"
28 july 2017,aries,"Pessimism about other people starts to melt away, and a more hopeful and happy attitude takes its place. Maybe it’s because you’re starting to realize that true happiness comes from within, and doesn’t have to be held hostage by outside events and others.

"
28 july 2016,aries,"Stop, start, stop, start.  A wonky mix of planetary angles is creating this effect, forcing you to question which step to take next. The Moon in Taurus pleads for security, yet Uranus in your sign is saying, “Go for it!” And intelligent Mercury is squaring Mars in the moody part of your chart. This vibe will continue for a few days, so hold off on making any major decisions.

"
29 july 2017,aries,"Cue the Rolling Stones: “You can’t always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you may get just what you need!” That’s the message from the cosmos as you may initially feel like obstacles are in your path. But by tomorrow you could be pleasantly surprised by what happens next.

"
29 july 2016,aries,"Who are you, really? That question will be on your mind over the next five months as Uranus retrogrades in your house of self-image. Uranus is the maverick of the solar system, challenging the status quo and pushing the proverbial envelope. The key is to discover who you really are and to bring this new and improved version of yourself to the world without burning bridges and going over the top.

"
30 july 2017,aries,"Your social circle could expand quite nicely in the near future, and serendipity plays a part in this! Be open to going new places, trying different things and meeting unusual people. You never know whom they might introduce you to.

"
30 july 2016,aries,"It’s time to clean house, literally and metaphorically. Intelligent Mercury buzzes into your house of efficiency and de-stressing for the next few weeks. Bring order to your home and work place by clearing out files, desks and closets. Knock out tasks that have been on your to-do list forever. And since your body is a temple, you need to keep that structure clean too: vitamins, plenty of water, nutritious foods and deep restful sleep are on the agenda.

"
31 july 2017,aries,"Expressing your inner truth becomes far easier now that gentle Venus is in Cancer. Your sense of confidence and contentment will rise as you express yourself more deeply to loved ones. Romance can blossom too under this aspect, as well as domestic matters.

"
31 july 2016,aries,"If someone tries to throw their weight around you won’t be in the mood for putting up with it! A Moon-Pluto opposition could possibly threaten your sense of security, emotional or otherwise. But don’t become emotional. Your intuition is in rare form today–use it to figure out what’s going on in the other person’s head.

"
1 august 2017,aries,"Feeling more relaxed about your life is quite possible thanks to some positive lunar energy, and this is a good thing. You’ll be more likely to take an educated risk or a chance on something that has appealed to you without breaking the bank or doing something foolish.

"
1 august 2016,aries,"Get off the fence! Two fabulous trines in your love sector tell you to put a ring on it or to make more serious plans. Singles, get off your duff and head to where people congregate, and I’m not talking about a watering hole. Museums, concerts, outdoor plays, street fairs, the beach, the park–these are your best places for bumping into a new flame.

"
2 august 2017,aries,"Long term plans get a healthy boost as passion meets practicality. Use the first three weeks of August to develop momentum, and then get ready for the brakes to come off on the 25th when Saturn resumes direct motion.

"
2 august 2016,aries,"Ready to shine in the spotlight? With the new moon in your house of recognition, and energetic Mars moving into blue-skies-ahead Sag, all eyes will be on you! Give ’em  something to  talk about, Aries. It’s time to bust out of an old self-image that just doesn’t fit you anymore.

"
3 august 2017,aries,"Watch the attitude there, skippy! Erratic Uranus begins a five-month retrograde in your house of self–which could make you a wee bit pushy (or dare I say arrogant?). You also need to carefully think through personal initiatives during this time period; don’t leap in too quickly without doing your homework.

"
3 august 2016,aries,"Slow down there, skippy! A strong Uranus-Moon angle is firing you up to after some pretty sweet dreams and passions. With planets in frisky, fun Leo, you’re feeling adventurous and ready to take a gamble. But you need to consider the details, the small stuff, the routines and habits you’ll need in order to get the results you want. Patience.

"
4 august 2017,aries,"Don’t let a lover or family member use guilt or strong arm tactics in order to get you to do things their way. It’s time to rewrite those old, tired scripts that your family unit has been reciting anyway. When Mercury retrogrades on the 12th, you’ll be so done  with this kind of nonsense.

"
4 august 2016,aries,"Buh-bye, inertia! With the Moon buzzing past Venus and Mercury in the most efficient part of your chart, your desire to tackle projects is on the rise.

Just don’t rush it this week. Plan before you act.

"
5 august 2017,aries,"A little creative thinking may be necessary in order to work through problems that have been of concern. Handling people and issues the same old way as before will only get you the same results. Fortunately with inspirational Neptune active in your intuition sector, you should be able to hit upon a smart solution.

"
5 august 2016,aries,"An interesting period in your work life opens up as Venus enters your house of office environment and co-workers. While you’ll be able to outwardly get along with them and act the part of a team player, your intuition will be actively picking up on who’s not. You may even see signs of dissension among the group in the week ahead as they may not be able to agree on projects. No worries, however. Your ability to impress higher-ups is strong.

"
6 august 2017,aries,"You may find yourself in a situation in which you need to lay down the law with someone, whether you really want to do it or not! And it could be someone close, so remain diplomatic as you set new boundaries. It’s also possible that the other person is overly optimistic with their expectations, which you need to address.

"
6 august 2016,aries,"Can’t see the forest for the trees? Or maybe all you can focus on is the clearing ahead so that you can get the heck out of the forest. A friction-filled standoff between planets in Virgo and others in Sagittarius is creating a situation in which you’re mentally boggled down. It’s details versus the big picture, today’s needs versus those of the future. Take a deep breath and count to ten. Clarity starts to return early in the week.

"
7 august 2017,aries,"Making new connections is in the stars as tonight’s lunar eclipse occurs in your networking sector. A group endeavor that you’ve been working on may come to a successful close, and now some fresh opportunities could come your way.

"
7 august 2016,aries,"With Venus and Mercury in your efficient sixth house, duty is calling your name. Problem is, you may be getting so anxious to get things done that frustration is building.

"
8 august 2016,aries,"A sparking angle between the Moon and Chiron enables you to get to the root of things that have been troubling you, Aries. Whether you decide to sort them out on your own or share them with a close confidante is up to you. It appears that your little brain has been hashing the same things over and over again in recent weeks. That could be due to Saturn’s retrograde spin in your ninth house of expansion, but good news: the ringed planet goes direct this Saturday.

"
9 august 2017,aries,"Taking a creative risk, especially in your career, is often what leads to big breakthroughs. And today the time is right to consider how to be more assertive and ground-breaking with your ideas.

"
9 august 2016,aries,"A happy angle between the Moon and Venus sheds light on a situation that you have been trying to resolve (or take action on) for some time now.

"
10 august 2017,aries,"Working together as a team becomes a heck of a lot easier thanks to six  orbs in the solar system all forming helpful aspects.

Intelligent Mercury is pointing out ways in which you can do the job smarter, better and more efficiently. Plan meetings and client presentations to showcase your brainstorms. The 17th also rocks for doing the same.

"
11 august 2017,aries,"Sshhh! Keep things to yourself at the office, especially if you’re job hunting. Loose lips will sink your ship. The same goes for office gossip–avoid it.

"
11 august 2016,aries,"You need to do a little more digging, Aries, when it comes to analyzing an idea you’ve been considering. With intelligent Mercury in your efficiency sector, you will be able to come up with a practical, workable plan. It may require you to take on some new habits, protocols or technologies, but the outlook for success is high.

"
12 august 2017,aries,"Yum! A super romantic weekend arrives with the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, winking at each other across the heavens. It’s wonderful for some alone time with your amour, a time for discussing your deepest feelings and wishes. Singles are in a good spot to meet someone new, most likely face to face rather than online.

"
12 august 2016,aries,"Aries folks will venture where angels fear to tread, so telling you to take a chance is like waving a red flag at el toro. Nonetheless, the cosmos is  telling you to jazz things up a little bit by taking a risk in the day-to-day stuff. For example, if your standard exercise routine is running, rent a surfboard and catch some waves. Salespeople–try new prospecting methods. Instead of buying the usual produce, head to the farmer’s market and take home some heirloom tomatoes. Live a little!

"
13 august 2017,aries,"Taking risks gets a heck of a lot saner with structured Saturn in a good spot to protect you. Whether it’s in love, business or a personal endeavor that means a lot to you, it’s easier to stick your neck out—and actually see some happy results for your efforts.

"
13 august 2016,aries,"Welcome news: Saturn resumes direct motion in your optimistic ninth house of travel, study, publishing and other high falutin’ plans you’ve got cooked up. Over the past five months there was a “back to the old drawing board” feeling here as stern Saturn wanted to make sure that your future plans are solid. They should be now, and with Mars in the same part of the sky, your desire and ambition should begin to soar.

"
14 august 2017,aries,"Where’s this relationship going? With the Moon and Venus forming a sweet angle in the most security-driven parts of your chart, you could receive answers to that question today.

"
14 august 2016,aries,"You may be questioning the best way to go about completing or tackling a project. You have the motivation, but something is holding you back–and it’s called Neptune. The watery planet may be casting doubts in your mind as to the best way to go about things. Take your time; a Venus-Pluto trine on Wednesday will clear things up for you.

"
15 august 2017,aries,"Reaching an agreement with someone won’t be easy today with a Venus-Pluto opposition. Trying to force matters won’t work, nor will sitting back and letting someone walk all over you. This energy continues for a few days: wait until Friday to reach an accord.

"
15 august 2016,aries,"Career matters soar this week and today could bring about some interesting changes. The Moon holds a conversation with power broker Pluto, whose job it is to point out the flaws in a situation so that you can fix them. Sometimes this means starting over from scratch; other times you just need to tweak a bit. But your attitude toward your occupation is changing. Is it time for something new?

"
16 august 2017,aries,"What’s the point of hashing over bright ideas in your brain, and not setting them in motion? It’s time to take things from the dream stage to reality. If you’re waiting for the “right moment”, it’s here. It’s now.

"
16 august 2016,aries,"Uranus is known as the planet of genius and innovation, and today it has your back in a big way. It forms an amazing trine, the best angle possible, with the Sun in your house of creativity. Flashes of brilliance could come your way, so pay attention. Whether you pen the next Harry Potter-type series of books, patent the next Spanx, or code a hot app, your grey matter can deliver today.

"
17 august 2017,aries,"Two of the most optimistic planets in the solar system, Venus and Jupiter, are at odds today….but it’s just a temporary blip on the cosmic radar. However, you may temporarily feel misunderstood or thrown off balance somehow. Things improve tomorrow when a lunar aspect helps you realize that you have nothing to worry about.

"
17 august 2016,aries,"Uranus has a job to do: shaking up your self-image. And it will do so today with zest, teaming up with the Sun to help you revamp your attitude and appearance. The upside of this? Your love life can take an unexpected turn for the better. Happy, unexpected twists and turns in romance could happen, so doll yourself up and head out the door.

"
18 august 2017,aries,"Open up and be more vulnerable with the ones you love, Aries. Sometimes we become so busy with our daily responsibilities that we forget (or we’re too tired) to display affection and have a heartfelt talk. Today opens up the floodgates.

"
18 august 2016,aries,"Joining forces with others is the message behind today’s full moon in Aquarius. Whether you’re looking for a new job, trying to arrange play dates for the kids or embarking on a fitness plan, by reaching out and teaming up with likeminded folks you can make a heck of a lot of progress. Oh, and buddies can be quite  instrumental in finding you new love.

"
19 august 2017,aries,"With Monday’s solar eclipse getting ever closer, you may be feeling reticent about changes that you know need to be made. Despite your sign’s independent spirit, taking a risk may seem too dicey right now. That’s OK–by Tuesday your confidence will rebound.

"
19 august 2016,aries,"Climbing the ladder will be an easier task if you network with others. Yesterday’s full moon encouraged you to cast your net far and wide. But a Moon-Venus opposition today recommends that you keep your plans quiet as far as co-workers are concerned. It’s also a smart move to keep brilliant ideas to yourself, and to only share them with decision makers.

"
20 august 2016,aries,"Can’t see the forest for the trees. That describes you today, Aries, as a Moon-Venus opposition clouds your vision. You may be too close to a situation to view it objectively. Your best bet is to focus your attention on something else (preferably pleasurable) and wait til next Wednesday for greater clarity.

"
21 august 2016,aries,"As Mars and Saturn move ever closer to each other in your enterprising ninth house, your energy level should be rising. Big projects or tasks are looking less daunting and a can-do attitude is developing, overcoming inertia. Can it get any better than this? Yes! The Moon in Aries forms a wonderful angle to these two, helping put a nice dose of passion into whatever it is that you’re deciding to undertake.

"
22 august 2016,aries,"Bragging rights! Today’s a good time to let the boss and clients know just how good you really are (with a touch of humility, of course). Although they may already know that, thanks to three beneficial planets hovering in your house of efficiency. With a conjunction between lucky Jupiter and chatty Mercury, you could hear job-related news that puts a smile on your face. And with the Sun entering this part of the sky today too, your productivity will be off the charts.

"
23 august 2016,aries,"An idea or project that you’ve been working on is gaining steam, courtesy of Mars and Saturn meeting in your enterprising house of big visions and possibilities.

"
24 august 2016,aries,"If you’re going to set off on a journey, you’re going to need a good map.

25 august 2016,aries,"Your confidence about how to proceed with a particular plan may flag as doubts get the better of you. You may feel that you don’t have the smarts, the right contacts, or the guts to pull it off. But take heart–this is a temporary event caused by the emotional Moon opposing Saturn. All you need is a fresh perspective to put things in the right frame, and that will come over the weekend.

"
26 august 2016,aries,"Wake up and smell the coffee! A reality check comes your way from the general direction of Mars and Neptune. They’re in a cosmic smackdown today, so take a look at expectations in all areas of your life. Are you kidding yourself about anything? Not sticking to good habits or routines, yet expecting change? Be brutally honest.

"
27 august 2016,aries,"The two most helpful planets in our solar system team up today: Venus and Jupiter. They meet in your house of fitness and vitality. What a wonderful aspect for kicking off a diet and exercise regimen, or to finally get rid of aches and pains that have been bothering you! This also happens to be your sector of efficiency and getting things done, so don’t be surprised if you become highly motivated to ditch the clutter and go feng shui.

"
28 august 2016,aries,"Now that the Moon is transiting one of the most emotional parts of your chart, you might be feeling a bit moody, possible even nostalgic for days gone by. But a positive aspect between Chiron, the wounded healer, and La Luna bodes well for getting past this. Meditation, a walk in  nature, a soothing cup of tea and a good book–do whatever you need to slow down and relax.

"
29 august 2016,aries,"Thinking about going on a diet or kickstarting an exercise program? Make your decision today as glam Venus is getting ready to leave your house of vitality and fitness. Mercury retrogrades in this sector tomorrow, so you may want to review why previous regimens didn’t work. It’s also wise to rid yourself of chronic aches and pains over the next three weeks.

"
30 august 2016,aries,"Collaboration with another talented person could be the key to success, whether it’s in your career, a volunteer organization, or a neighborhood group.

It’s all about streamlining your life right now, from household chores to office work flow.

"
31 august 2016,aries,"A sudden burst of initiative may catch you by surprise as you decide to get your act together. Take a look at the areas of your life where things are not organized or create confusion, whether it’s a routine, a certain person or a bad habit. Then resolve to take action. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse will light a fire under you to see things through to a successful conclusion.

"
1 september 2016,aries,"Revamp your resume! A juicy solar eclipse in your work zone could bring you a sudden offer of employment you weren’t expecting. Your current employer might have an opening for you that holds more responsibility, so make a short list of your talents and achievements. This is also a great time to get back on the fitness bandwagon and shed those excess summertime burger-and-beer pounds.

"
2 september 2016,aries,"You can make amazing headway today on a work project, maybe even dazzling others with your ideas and productivity. But hold off a bit before going public with it, as it seems that more planning is in order. Watch out for detractors too as murky Neptune gives the stinkeye to your success. It may be wise to wait until the 7th for any big announcements or presentations.

"
3 september 2016,aries,"As the emotional Moon makes tight angles to both happy Jupiter and romantic Venus, this is a wonderful day for matters of the heart. It’s perfect for figuring out how you can spend more time with the people you love, so get practical about the daily grind and see how you can carve out more time for the things that matter.

"
4 september 2016,aries,"With the luckiest planet in our solar system entering your relationship house later this week, both romantic and business alliances are about to take on a new level of commitment. Give some consideration today as to what you’d like to experience in both, and that includes you singles. In particular, the Moon will have you questioning the balance of power. Have you been too quick to give your power away to a partner? Or are you too domineering? It’s time to find balance.

"
5 september 2016,aries,"Sharing is caring. Or is it? A Moon-Uranus opposition today will find you questioning just how much information you want to share with others. You may decide to keep your opinions and feelings to yourself, at least until Wednesday, when the atmosphere changes and you can relax about being candid.

"
6 september 2016,aries,"The path ahead is going to become more clear over the next few days, Aries. A wonderful trine between the illuminating Sun and life-changing Pluto will help you set priorities and develop a plan to attain your goals.

"
7 september 2016,aries,"Great day to focus on the future with four benevolent planes smiling at each other across the heavens. Career progress is possible with a strong Sun-Pluto trine, and you may even be considering transferring into a completely new field.

"
8 september 2016,aries,"Who wants to live their life hiding in a corner? Not you, Aries! With the passionate Moon swinging past energetic Mars and stable Saturn in the most adventurous part of your chart, your motivation to live La Vida Loca will increase. But Neptune may be stirring up doubts as it’s active in the part of your chart that governs the subconscious mind. Let your concerns fly out the window and focus on coloring outside the lines.

"
9 september 2016,aries,"The love train’s a’comin’ to town, Aries! Generous Jupiter powers its way into your seventh house of commitment, a place it hasn’t visited in over a decade. Many of you will find a keeper, get engaged, decide to move in together, or cement an already existing bond. And the best way to further your career (and income) over the years head may well be to enter into some form or business alliance. Two heads are definitely better than one under this aspect, as Jupiter governs profits.

"
10 september 2016,aries,"Got an opinion? You may want to keep it to yourself today, as you might rub someone the wrong way-even if you’re 100% right! A difficult Saturn-Neptune square could create an adversary in your midst, so stay on your toes. Likewise, think twice before revealing big plans or ideas to others unless you trust them implicitly. Neptune is the planet of deception, so keep your cards close to your vest.

"
11 september 2016,aries,"What it is that you truly want out of love is the focus of today’s planetary energy. Regardless as to whether you’re committed or single, a Venus-Pluto square finds you questioning the path ahead. However, this doesn’t spell trouble. It just means that you need to develop a clear focus, and if you have a partner, you need to be on the same page.

"
12 september 2016,aries,"Look before you leap! Impulsive Venus may spur you to desire something: a person, a big purchase, or even a particular course of action. But Pluto is in a tough spot, warning you to take things slow. You need to wrap up things you’ve already started before moving on to the next phase.

"
13 september 2016,aries,"What needs to stay, and what has to go? With a lunar eclipse coming this Friday in your house of closure, start making an inventory. A terse Mars-Sun aspect today may find you chomping at the bit, anxious to make changes, but El Sol advises that you take it slow and pay attention to procedure and details. Rome wasn’t built in a day.

"
14 september 2016,aries,"A sudden burst of motivation could hit you as the Moon makes terrific aspects to spontaneous Uranus and energetic Mars. When the Moon enters Pisces later in the week, your imagination will soar. Use this inspirational vibe to imagine what you’d like to experience—then manifest it.

"
15 september 2016,aries,"You’re a walking radio tower today as the vibey Moon meets up with even vibier Neptune. Good thing, too, as tomorrow’s eclipse will illuminate the most hidden parts of your subconscious mind. Pay close attention to your dreams and any gut hunches you receive. They will be on point, providing you with information that you need to make key decisions.

"
16 september 2016,aries,"Out with the old, in with the new! It’s like New Year’s Eve all over again today as a lunar eclipse takes place in your house of closure. People and situations that are no longer working for you need to be evaluated and perhaps removed from your life. While this can mean making decisions that are difficult, it’s necessary. Mars is in a bit of a tight spot, warning you to not go too fast or too far with changes. That’s the beauty of an eclipse: it sets up a six-month period in which you can initiate bold new plans.

"
17 september 2016,aries,"Yesterday’s eclipse was designed to bust you out of old, worn-out routines and situations, and the action can start today! A bold and energetic trine between Mars and Uranus could be the impetus you need to kick off new initiatives. Mars is in your house of ideas and opinions, so be loud and proud. What if the people around you aren’t ready for this new you? Too bad! You can’t stop a roaring freight train.

"
18 september 2016,aries,"A sudden burst of adrenaline could hit as the passionate Moon connects with energetic and spontaneous Uranus. Charging forward and tackling projects, whether it’s just cleaning out the garage or planning world domination, will be on your mind. A romantic or business partner, however, may not share your zest for getting things done. Roll with it because this could change by tomorrow.

"
19 september 2016,aries,"You’re in the mood for love with a yummy Venus-Mars meetup, but you won’t be settling for just a person with a pulse. The Moon in grounded Taurus signals amorous Neptune, ramping up your desire for a relationship with only the deepest kind of romance and intimacy.

With intelligent Mercury in your house of creating streamlined routines, you’re in a good position to come up with innovative ways to move forward.

"
22 september 2016,aries,"Once lucky Jupiter entered your seventh house of commitment back on the 9th, it opened up a thirteen-month window in which you can meet the love of your life, not to mention taking an existing relationship to a higher level. Well, now it gets even better. The Sun has just joined Jupiter in Libra, making the next four weeks even more  auspicious for romance.

"
23 september 2016,aries,"Don’t be too quick to put your all of your eggs in one basket, specifically in the hands of one person. A Moon-Jupiter square urges you to look out for #1, at least for the next few days. It’s not selfish to ensure that your own needs are being met in a relationship, whether it’s personal or business.

"
24 september 2016,aries,"Sometimes you just have to buckle down and handle the grunt work, and that’s what the cosmos is telling you today. Perhaps you need to get caught up with the pile of papers on your desk at home or the office. Maybe you need to balance the checkbook or empty out the garage. Start tackling things now so that you end up feeling in control of your life, instead of being overwhelmed.

"
25 september 2016,aries,"Got your eye on a hot romantic prospect? Or maybe you’re single without anyone in your crosshairs, stranded in the desert of love. Involved with someone terrific? Or perhaps you’re ready to move on. Aries, regardless of your status, today’s fabulous for making progress in the love department. The frisky Leo Moon winks at the Sun and Jupiter in the commitment zone. Make things happen.

"
26 september 2016,aries,"Amazing day for partnering up with someone courtesy of the annual Sun-Jupiter conjunction! In business, you could join forces with someone whose input could help you think more creatively. In love, it’s time to find a keeper or to advance an already serious relationship. Considering that the Moon in passionate Leo forms a terrific angle with long-term Saturn, whatever transpires has longevity–and fun!–written all over it.

"
27 september 2016,aries,"Your ambitions get a huge boost as assertive Mars barrels into your tenth house of achievement and success for the first time in two years. Pluto just went direct in this sector yesterday, helping you step into a more confident and powerful place. But you may decide in the weeks ahead to go it alone rather than to team up with someone else. If you do want to travel down a path with someone, be discerning–make sure they’re worth it.

"
29 september 2016,aries,"Inspiration to get fit and healthy may strike out of the blue today, which is always a good thing. The Moon makes a helpful aspect to spontaneous Uranus, indicating that even if you’re already on a diet or exercise regimen that it may need to be tweaked. Keep your mind open to new options.

30 september 2016,aries,"A romantic weekend for all signs lies ahead with the two most amorous planets, Venus and Neptune, forming a perfect angle for love. But your sign especially benefits today from a sweet meeting of the Moon and lucky Jupiter in your commitment sector. Singles, keep your eyes peeled. Attached rams should plan a lovely date night. Just make sure, however, that you’re not wearing rose-colored glasses when it comes to love.

"
1 october 2016,aries,"A new chapter can open up in a romantic relationship, thanks to today’s new moon in your partnership sector. The same holds true for business alliances, so if you’ve been considering retaining an expert to represent your interests (such as a booking agent or an accountant), or entering into a standard partnership, now’s the time. A hush-hush trine between Venus and Jupiter suggests that you keep plans quiet, at least for now: your engagement, pregnancy, or business deal.

"
2 october 2016,aries,"La Luna enters Scorpio today, focusing your mind on earthly desires: sex, intimacy, and financial abundance, to name a few goodies. With yesterday’s new moon in your commitment sector, no doubt you’ll be thinking not just about having a partner but one who can add a lot of spice to your life! Teaming up with a savvy business expert is also in the stars, someone who can add to your bottom line.

"
3 october 2016,aries,"With the two most domineering planets in the solar system, Pluto and Mars, both in your house of authority and ambition, you are a force to be reckoned with these days. But strong-arming people into doing things your way is not the best MO, nor is trying to do everything on your own. The best strategy right now is to work with others, giving them a voice as well as some responsibilities.

"
4 october 2016,aries,"Potent day in the cosmos with the Sun and Saturn forming a sextile, a positive aspect. Saturn is the planet of thinking long term and happens to be in the house of thinking big, so this makes for an interesting placement. Partnerships of all kinds are the focus, whether they’re business or romantic. Some Aries will get engaged today, decide to move in together, find the right one, or take a relationship to a higher level. Others will hold conversations with potential business partners or experts, such as booking agents or accountants, to help further their careers.

"
5 october 2016,aries,"Duty calls as errands, family responsibilities and the daily grind at the office don’t seem to diminish. But a cheerful Moon-Jupiter connection reminds you that there’s more to life than just mucking through your days. If you don’t start taking more downtime for yourself and your loved ones, the stress will mount–and so will your discontent. Schedule in some free time.

6 october 2016,aries,"Partnership progress can get stymied today as Mars squares Jupiter. Both of these are go-go-go planets, and they’re trying to achieve progress when it comes to romance and business alliances. But today they’re stuck in the mud. One of you may be ready to move forward and the other is not. This drama will continue into next week, so patience will be a virtue.

"
7 october 2016,aries,"Chatty Mercury enters your house of serious partnerships, which certainly is helpful! Other planets in that house are forming tense angles to others, creating friction with bosses, decision makers and business connections. In addition, your relationship with a loved one could be a bit strained right now. Mercury’s appearance is a blessing as it will help you communicate your needs, ideas and feelings to others. Don’t use your words to strong arm people, however, a possibility under current aspects.

"
8 october 2016,aries,"Inspiration can strike at any moment as the Moon in your ambitious tenth house sextiles Neptune. Right now is the best time in over two years to pursue big goals, thanks to Mars and Pluto in your success zone. The Moon joins them over the weekend, making this an auspicious time to plan. Neptune is known as the muse of artists and scientists but all Aries can work with this positive energy to achieve results.

"
9 october 2016,aries,"Someone’s feeling feisty! The Moon’s passage past Mars and Pluto this weekend is encouraging you to take control of your life, relationships and circumstances. But resistance on your part may crop up, whether it’s based on fear, procrastination or being too worried about what other people think. Next week’s full moon in Aries will demand that you step into your power.

"

Today the Moon is dancing through the house of your fondest hopes and wishes, so start dreaming. Singles, you’re not left out–what is it that you’re seeking in a lover?

"
11 october 2016,aries,"This is one of the best days of the year to discuss future plans with your amour. Optimistic Jupiter is in fine form with chatty Mercury by its side. Singles, you could meet someone with long term potential in the weeks ahead. All Aries benefit from next week’s full moon in your sign, which puts your desires in the spotlight.

"
12 october 2016,aries,"Do you want the same things as others who are in your intimate circle? It’s important to communicate with a lover or business partner right now. Just watch the tendency to become dictatorial, a possibility with aggressive Mars in your house of authority. The full moon on the 16th is in your sign, so no doubt you’re looking out for #1. Which is OK as long as you can share common ground with someone close.

"
13 october 2016,aries,"Hell, yeah! You’ve got ambition—loads of it—thanks to megawatt Mats and power broker Pluto in your house of goals and success. But not everyone around you is as fired up as you are, something to keep in mind. You run the risk of annoying a romantic partner or business alliance with your let’s-get-moving attitude. Just focus on blazing your own path without expecting others to go along for the ride.

"
14 october 2016,aries,"You’re craving stability when it comes to life’s biggest issues, and serious Saturn wants to deliver it. This is an excellent day for talking things over with someone who can help make things happen. With erratic Uranus active in Aries, chances are you’re feeling restless, maybe even anxious. Don’t let anxiety get in the way of making smart long term decisions.

"
15 october 2016,aries,"My way or the highway? You could be feeling mighty feisty as a number of planets are placing the emphasis on your needs. You might even be surprised at how determined you suddenly are to protect your interests. With tomorrow’s full moon in your sign, things are going to reach critical mass.

"
16 october 2016,aries,"What about me? That may be the question on your lips as a full moon in Aries stirs up your own wishes. Lately the planets have been testing you, with people in your circle placing demands on your time and attention. Now it’s time to focus on what you want. With erratic Uranus near the Moon, even you might be surprised at how strongly you react to situations that have been going on for far too long. This isn’t about getting angry, but instead about making changes. Your attention may fall first on close relationships, such as romantic or business alliances, as the Sun opposes Uranus. Does this mean Splitsville? Maybe. But it could also herald a new chapter in which you start putting your own needs at the same level as others’.

"
17 october 2016,aries,"Oh, yeah. A smokin’ hot trine between the Moon and Pluto can work wonders when it comes to transforming your career prospects. Actually, any major goal of yours can get a facelift today as Pluto urges you to rethink what it is you’d like to accomplish. Some ambitions may be tossed entirely to be replaced by better ones; others may just need a minor tweak. When Venus enters Sagittarius tomorrow it’s nothing but green lights ahead.

"
18 october 2016,aries,"Sometimes taking a risk can feel uncomfortable or even downright scary. But now that Venus is in your house of living outside the box, it should be much easier to put yourself out there on a limb. Dating, job hunting, applying to school, starting a business, trying a new sport or hobby, traveling to an exotic destination–dare to dream and to then go for it.

"
19 october 2016,aries,"This is one of the most powerful days of the year to discuss future plans with someone: where a romance is heading, your career, or a business venture. A rare meeting between Mars and Pluto in your dynamic tenth house of authority helps put you in the driver’s seat. Not only that, influential people may go out of their way in the days ahead to help you: putting in a good word, acting as a mentor, or introducing you to a more forward thinking group of folks. But you have to let them know that you’re interested, so don’t be shy!

"
20 october 2016,aries,"Did any issues come up with someone close at the full moon this past Sunday? If so, they may be back for discussion again, and truth be told things could get tense. With erratic Uranus acting up in your house of self-esteem and goals, you may feel confined by what you perceive to be limitations from others. To top it off Venus is encouraging you to be independent and go after passion projects that mean a lot to you. Try to work things out, but don’t forget to take care of yourself while you’re at it.

"
21 october 2016,aries,"Insecurity about your job or business could arise with a Moon-Mars-Pluto opposition. The bottom line is that Mars and Pluto are hell bent on seeing to it that you achieve higher levels of success. So why the fear and worry? It could be that you’re considering entering a new industry, changing jobs or switching up your income earning strategies. That’s nothing to fear, though—it’s to be commended.

"

Over the next four weeks you can get a lot closer to another person, not only physically but emotionally. Singles, a new hottie may be close at hand—just make sure that if you want more than a quick canoodle, find out what makes this person tick.

Entrepreneurs, you may discover that others want to be a part of your venture by forming a partnership or simply providing venture capital.

"
23 october 2016,aries,"The planets are suggesting that Aries lovers get to know their partner better through quality time discussions. Today’s a good day to get started with a Jupiter-Neptune aspect, and things will get even better in the weeks ahead. That’s because candid Mercury enters your house of bonding and intimacy tomorrow for a three-week stay. If you have something special you want to discuss with a lover, this Thursday is stellar. Mark your calendar.

"
24 october 2016,aries,"Ggrrrrr, tiger! Mercury sashays into your house of libido and intimacy for a three-week stay. It’s not only a heavenly time for boudoir activities but it’s also excellent for holding deep conversations with the one you love. Singles, you’ll be more charismatic than ever, so strut your stuff! A new moon in this part of the sky on the 30th helps inaugurate fresh changes.

"
25 october 2016,aries,"Snap out of it! A tense angle between the two planets of love, Venus and Neptune, indicates that you need to get real about romance. Operating on pure emotion isn’t going to fly. If you’ve been fantasizing about a person or relationship, start being rational. If you’ve been using guilt or passive-aggressive tactics to get your way, try to a more direct approach. That’s the best way to clear up your mind and make progress.

"
26 october 2016,aries,"Ready to take a chance in love? Or maybe you’re already involved and want to put some more spice into your romance. Then go for it!

Make it your business to ooze charisma over the next few days.

"
28 october 2016,aries,"You may be open to a romantic adventure under today’s planetary aspects. Take a chance on a different kind of lover, someone who’s not the usual type. Book a trip to someplace exotic, a place that the two of you haven’t visited before. Singles could meet a new love while in transit. Abundant Jupiter tells you to take a risk, as it will open your heart.

"
29 october 2016,aries,"If you’ve been sticking to the same old routine, doing things the usual way without considering fresher options, the cosmos may give you a kick in the pants today. But this is a positive event as it will help you get out of an unproductive rut. Instead, your eyes will be opened to new habits and methods that will prove to be a lot more courageous and adventuresome, without being risky. Live a little!

"
30 october 2016,aries,"A sparkling new moon sets the stage for more romance and intimacy in the months ahead! It falls in your house of deep emotional and physical bonding, so don’t be surprised if your desire for sex and soulful talks increases dramatically. Vibey Neptune is in a terrific angle from your hush-hush sector indicating that you may be in the mood for more private time alone with an amour. Likewise, you could be harboring a crush on someone–or an admirer could be crushing on you.

"
31 october 2016,aries,"Someone may be determined this week to show you who’s the boss. Whether they really are or not is another story! Keep a cool head about you, as erratic Uranus may prompt you to lash out against their nonsense. This is a classic Emperor’s New Clothes  kind of situation. Let them make a fool of themselves while you smile serenely.

"
1 november 2016,aries,"Peace at last? A helpful Sun-Neptune trine helps you get to the bottom of emotional issues that have been weighing you down. Whether they’re unpleasant childhood memories, mistrust and grudges from an old romantic relationship or bad habits, you can make enormous headway today. Identifying what’s troubling you is the first step and the Sun will illuminate the way.

"
2 november 2016,aries,"Take a risk or hold back? That’s the big question as the emotional Moon swings through your house of experimentation. Yes, you want serenity and comfort, but another voice in your head urges you to take some chances. From your planetary outlook it appears that you’ll opt for being a little adventurous. Things will become more clear by Saturday.

"
3 november 2016,aries,"People in positions of power may be considering you for a particular job or assignment, and it’s in your best interest to show them that you have the chops to handle it. That shouldn’t be a problem with eloquent, fast thinking Mercury in your house of financial strength. Whatever you initiate now could pay off handsomely in the future. Keep at it and plan major presentations for Monday.

"
4 november 2016,aries,"People in positions of authority may be difficult to read. They could also be downright difficult. But keep your tongue—and your emotions—in check, as an outburst or argument won’t help matters. Wait until Monday when a positive Sun-Pluto aspect makes it far easier to communicate.

"
5 november 2016,aries,"Life is beautiful! Well, it should be anyway, especially for your sign. That’s because Uranus forms a glorious aspect with lovely Venus in the most optimistic and adventurous part of your chart. Don’t be surprised if you experience an “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore” moment. Spontaneous Uranus could induce you (very quickly I might add) to get out of a rut and start living life your way. if your life isn’t beautiful, then it’s up to you to change things.

"
6 november 2016,aries,"Spontaneity can work for you or against you, and with erratic Uranus stirring up the pot, you need to make wise decisions. With Mars getting ready to move into the house of long-held dreams on Wednesday you may already be chomping at the bit. Slow down there, ram, and give things time to develop and manifest.

"
7 november 2016,aries,"Should you go things alone or be a member of a team? Conflicting planetary aspects urge you to showcase your personal talents to decision makers yet play nice with others. Once Mars enters Aquarius on Wednesday you could be drawn into group projects, but things could get competitive. Be a trooper yet still look out for #1.

"
8 november 2016,aries,"The Moon in the friendliest part of your chart encourages you to reach out to friends, neighbors and business contacts. Over the next five weeks they will play an important role in your life, introducing you to new pals, helping you gain access to clubs or networks you’d like to join, and maybe even assist you in finding a new job—or lover. Don’t be shy! Spontaneous Uranus in your sign will give you the jolt of energy you need to start making those calls. Once you get going, the momentum will build.

"
9 november 2016,aries,"You’ve been working hard lately and the planets are getting ready to give you a much-needed break. Now that gregarious Mars is in your friendship sector, let your hair down and do some socializing. That shouldn’t be too hard, what with all of the holiday get togethers on the way. But you could meet new people who could put you in touch with decision makers, or those who could be mentors to you. Pals could play matchmaker over the next five weeks as well, all the more reason to get out of the house!

"
10 november 2016,aries,"Your intuition is the best source of wisdom today so don’t ignore it. Your sixth sense could be right on target, especially when it comes to matters involving love and money. Start taking control of your future in these areas, demanding security as well as a clear plan for the future. Next week’s full moon will put an end to shaky finances and the words “It’s complicated” when it comes to romance.

"
11 november 2016,aries,"Who needs to wait till New Year’s Eve to start coming up with their 2017 resolutions? Not you, Aries! With magnetic Venus now in the most ambitious part of your chart, spend the next three weeks pondering which passion projects to go after. It’s also a great time to hold serious conversations with a lover about your goals for the long term.

"
12 november 2016,aries,"Be selective! Now that Mercury is in your optimistic house of taking chances, you may be ready to jump head first into quite a few new opportunities. But you run the risk of taking on too much too soon. Choose the best of the bunch and save the others for early 2017.

"
13 november 2016,aries,"With tomorrow’s full moon in your earnings sector, you may be seeing nothing but dollar signs around you. And with profitable Venus now in your ambition sector, you should be able to track down more sources of income. But slow and steady is the way to go. Don’t let impatience overrule common sense.

"
14 november 2016,aries,"Best time all year to score a raise, new job or close a client! A super full moon in Taurus, your income sector, helps make the cash register ring. A Neptune-North Node aspect tells you that it’s not your karma to be broke or struggling with finances! You deserve success, and with Mars in a super angle to the Moon, right now its the people you know (more so than what you know) who can help you move forward.

"
15 november 2016,aries,"The battle between security and independence rages on today, as four celestial orbs are at odds with each other in the heavens. A Moon-Neptune aspect may be making you feel confused or concerned about heading down a particular path, while Mercury and Mars are urging you to go for it! One of the problems may be deciding whose opinion or character you can trust. When Neptune goes direct this weekend clarity will return.

"
16 november 2016,aries,"It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it that counts. Reconsider how you connect with the people closest to you, as you may have been too blunt lately for your own good. This holds true for face to face conversations as well as texts, tweets and other modes of communication. You may be too quick to say what’s on your mind when you really should be holding back a little bit. Give others the opportunity to voice their opinions and be diplomatic in your response.

"
17 november 2016,aries,"Some of the people around you may be difficult to read, and your mind might start dreaming up dramas and scenarios that may or may not be accurate. You still have a way to go on your personal journey when it comes to relating to others, which includes not being a doormat. The key is discernment: the ability to separate when you’re actually being mistreated, and when you’re not. A lot of this comes down to your sense of personal security.

"
18 november 2016,aries,"Trust issues? Don’t be surprised if you’re unsure as to whom you can rely on. With Mercury in the most optimistic part of your chart chances are that you’d like to believe that everyone is on your side. But a Neptune-Mercury square today warns that someone in your environment may be working at cross purposes to you, perhaps even trying to stall a big plan of yours. That’s OK. When the Sun enters Sagittarius next week, you’ll be unstoppable.

"
19 november 2016,aries,"Get ready to make progress! Neptune goes direct, helping you release worn out feelings of low self-esteem. Fears, worries and dramas should recede into the background as you start to feel more empowered. Better yet is that Venus, situated in your house of ambition and success, forms a positive aspect with Neptune, indicating that a career matter can be worked out. So update your resume, get a brag book of your accomplishments going, and prepare to toot your own horn. December will be an awesome month for making progress on all of your goals.

"
20 november 2016,aries,"Inspiration could strike today, so take any ideas that pop into your head seriously. As the Moon is in your house of fun and creativity, you might be inspired to take the kids to the science museum, sign up for a cooking class or take a chance in love. With the Sun entering the most adventurous part of your chart tomorrow, the words “I’m bored” should not be a part of your vocabulary.

"
21 november 2016,aries,"It’s all systems “go” as the mighty Sun rolls into Sagittarius, your enterprising house of personal growth and optimism. You can go after any passion or goal that’s close to your heart, the bigger, the better! That’s because assertive Mars is in your house of long-held dreams. There will be nothing stopping you, Aries.

"
22 november 2016,aries,"Talks between you and someone close can take on an optimistic new tone. You’re in more of an open-minded state, and if you can be flexible when it comes to sharing responsibilities (and opinions), progress can be made. With powerful Pluto in your house of authority, you may have  often felt that you’ve had to beat people over the head in order to be heard. But in the four weeks ahead, subtlety will get you much further.

"
23 november 2016,aries,"It’s time to make a clean break from the past. This doesn’t mean leaving your job, lover or home. But it does mean leaving a life of boredom, playing it safe or not going after the items on your bucket list. You’re not supposed to be buried in a casket with that bucket! The idea is to check those items off the list while your heart is still beating. It is, which means that it’s time to get moving.

"
24 november 2016,aries,"You can only do so much to please others, something that may become apparent today. Someone in your circle may try to act like the boss despite your open and diplomatic approach. While this isn’t worth ruining your day over, you may realize over the weekend that you need to take more of an authoritative approach with the people around you. Otherwise you’ll continue to get run over.

"
25 november 2016,aries,"You’re known as the go-getter sign of the zodiac and current cosmic activity indicates green lights ahead. Over the next week you can initiate changes that will carry forward for decades to come. If you need training, education or the help of a mentor, seek it out. No man or woman is an island.
 

"
26 november 2016,aries,"Sometimes you just need to switch up your perspective in order to see what’s really going on around you. It’s so easy to get caught up in the same old way of viewing life, but this can hamper your personal growth. Today a spectacular Uranus-Mercury trine endows you with out-of-the-box thinking. Pay attention, because Tuesday’s new moon will allow you to take these ideas and run with them.

"
27 november 2016,aries,"You need a time out from working and thinking all the time, and today the cosmos urges you to do just that. Mentally step away from your career and other goals and just chill. You’re too close to the issues at hand to see them clearly. This week inspiration will flow, helping you view things in a different light.

"
28 november 2016,aries,"Of all the signs of the zodiac, you’re the most motivated to bust out of a rut and doing things the same old way, Aries. As Albert Einstein said, “Insanity is doing the same things over and over again and expecting a different result.” With so many planets in your houses of independence, expansion and your deepest held wishes, there’s no place to go but up.

"
29 november 2016,aries,"You may be trying out which direction to head in, considering today’s new moon in the most adventurous part of your chart. But before you decide to head down a particular path, you need to ask yourself a few honest questions. Are you willing to take ownership of a project or the results you achieve? Are you ready to ask for help, perhaps partnering with someone? With Uranus acting up in your sign, you may feel like being a lone wolf, but Jupiter advises aligning yourself with others who have similar aims. Strike a balance between being independent and a team player.

"
30 november 2016,aries,"Yesterday’s new moon was all about starting new initiatives in all areas of your life, but today you may be confused about where and how to begin. The problem doesn’t seem to be a lack of bright ideas, but doubts and fears that you can pull them off. The smartest thing you can do right now is to seek help in areas where you feel unsure. Sign up for a class, find a mentor, listen to pod casts, read a how-to book. The internet is loaded with free resources; take advantage of them.

"
1 december 2016,aries,"Networking is the name of the game in the weeks ahead. A powerful, positive aspect today encourages you to get out and meet as many people as possible. Go through your contact list and reach out to folks who will put in good words for you, introduce you to a future spouse or will stimulate your brain. When love planet Venus enters this part of the sky on the 7th, friends can be your ticket to finding new love—which includes a platonic pal who’d like to be more!

"
2 december 2016,aries,"If you’re looking for a new job, positioning yourself for a raise or working on new services to add to your business, now’s the time to get cracking. Intelligent Mercury, the shrewd planet of negotiation, moves into your career house today for several weeks. Problem is, it’s scheduled to go retrograde on the 19th and you know what that means. Besides, with the holidays coming right after that it will be hard to find decision makers anyway. Make your mark now.

"
3 december 2016,aries,"Chances are that you’re thinking about life with a much more elevated view thanks to Mars helping you see the big picture. Sometimes we get so caught up in the petty details of our days that we’re blinded to other, more exciting possibilities. Today Mars links up with Saturn in yet another part of your chart that is expansive, so all systems are go! The decisions that you make in the near future can carry forward for decades, so choose wisely.

"
4 december 2016,aries,"Friends or acquaintances can be extraordinarily lucky for you in the weeks ahead. With a happy Moon-Mars connection today, reach out to pals and make plans. Better yet, put yourself in places where you could meet new faces: your church, a mommy meet up group, singles mixers, seminars, trade shows. Your contacts could be the key to opening new doors in love, business and just plain fun.

"
5 december 2016,aries,"Cue Frank Sinatra, circa 1969: “I did it my way!”  Yup, that old standard applies to you, Aries, as the planets are encouraging you to break from the (rat) pack and do your own thing. This doesn’t mean that you should ignore the advice or wisdom of others. On the contrary, you could learn a lot from friends and mentors. But your path in this lifetime is yours alone to travel.

"
6 december 2016,aries,"Go with the flow, as planetary influences tell you that you’ll need to work with a team rather than against them. You may be surprised to discover that you actually enjoy it! That’s because Mars is in your house of camaraderie, encouraging you to consider the ideas and the company of other people. When Venus enters this part of the sky tomorrow, getting along with people, no matter how difficult they may have been in the past, should get easier.

"
7 december 2016,aries,"Get ready to rub elbows and schmooze. Now that Venus is in your house of camaraderie, the people you know (and those whom you haven’t met yet!) can become an even more important part of your life. If you’re working on any kind of group project or volunteer effort, you may be wrapping it up around the time of the full moon on Tuesday. The next week is excellent for networking with people, whether you’re looking for love, a new job or just for fun.

"
8 december 2016,aries,"You may be anxious to take on a leadership role at work or in some kind of group activity, which is a good thing. But before you go much further you should pick the brain of someone who has already traveled down this path. You’re not suffering from a lack of bright ideas with the Sun and Saturn in your house of innovation. But why reinvent the wheel? If someone can offer you wisdom, take it.

"
9 december 2016,aries,"A powerful Sun-Saturn meet up on Saturday can help you initiate a big idea that has been rolling around in your mind. But first you need to nail down some of the specifics, and your best bet today is to reach out to someone who can provide you with advice. You may want to team up on this venture with someone else as two heads are better than one. Consider collaborations that will take an idea from the planning stages to reality.

"
10 december 2016,aries,"Your head may be in the clouds, but the good news is that your feet are firmly planted on the ground! Today is excellent for taking big dreams from the planning stage to the off-and-running stage. With serious Saturn by your side, you’ll be thinking logically and will have the discipline to see things through. If you need the advice of a mentor or someone who has traveled this path before, seek it. Gaining knowledge is the golden key.

"
11 december 2016,aries,"Your ideas about what you need in your closest personal relationships may be changing, Aries. While you crave security, you’re not willing to be a doormat or play second fiddle. There’s a strong independent streak developing, thanks to maverick Uranus spurring you to look after your own needs and desires. But you don’t have to give up the comfort and companionship of the people around you while you take care of your own personal business.

"
12 december 2016,aries,"It may be time to strike off on a new path you haven’t traveled before, Aries. Don’t be surprised if a restlessness seems to take over. You’re becoming aware that there are more options to life than you may have realized, and some of them look mighty tempting. Tomorrow’s full moon will help you crystallize some of these ideas and let you run with them. Will everyone around you be happy? Maybe, maybe not. But life’s too short to play it safe.

"
13 december 2016,aries,"Got a big idea? Don’t keep it stuck in the recesses of your mind. Today’s full moon in the sector that governs thinking and expression encourages you to go from the ruminating stage to the planning and action stage. It’s also a smart move to brainstorm with other people right now as two heads are better than one (the lunation is in Gemini,  duh!). With Saturn in an excellent position to the Sun, your plans can really go a long distance—as in a worldwide stage. As long as you don’t expect overnight success and you’re willing to put in hard work, let your thoughts take flight.

"
14 december 2016,aries,"Open up the lines of communication with the people in your circle if you want to make progress. With lucky Jupiter in your house of partnering up, you can make faster progress by sharing ideas and responsibilities with others. However, a tough Uranus-Jupiter aspect might make you rebel against sharing and cooperating. Are you involved with the right kind of people? When Uranus goes direct on the 29th, confusion about your friends, lover and business contacts should clear up.

"
15 december 2016,aries,"Getting bossed around? Four planets squaring off against each other in the heavens create a push-pull in which you may feel like Cinderella. This could be at home, at the office or within a romantic relationship. If that’s the case, you’ll have the opportunity to reflect upon the role you play in these circumstances once Mercury retrogrades next Monday. But you won’t be huddled in a corner, licking your wounds! Hell no. When the Sun enters Capricorn next Wednesday, you’ll be stepping into a place of personal power.

"
17 december 2016,aries,"Life is too short to be working all the time and the cosmos suggests that you have some fun this weekend! With the Moon entering Leo, your house of creativity, why don’t you set aside some time to pursue hobbies that may have fallen by the wayside? With structured Saturn in a helpful angle, you might even make this a regular habit. You may also realize that you need  to be involved in an activity that fills you up and puts a smile on your face.

"
18 december 2016,aries,"How to keep everyone happy? Your busy schedule may have you at wit’s end as you don’t have enough hours in the day for friends and loved ones, let alone yourself. With the Moon in fun-loving Leo you’re aching to have a good time and relax. Don’t worry–once Mars enters Pisces tomorrow, you’ll find more time to slow down and recharge your batteries.

"
19 december 2016,aries,"Keep a lid on it! Mars enters the most confidential part of your chart just as Mercury retrogrades in your house of ambition. The message? Plan big, say little. Conduct research behind closed doors. Not everyone needs to know what you have planned next.

"
20 december 2016,aries,"Despite the holiday madness the cosmos is telling you to slow down and go within. Now that Mars is in the part of your chart that governs the subconscious mind, reflect upon the circumstances and people that throw you off balance. Then make the determination to deal with them somehow. Whether that means excising them from you life (or should I say “exorcising”?!), reframing the problem, speaking with a therapist or learning how to become more mindful, you’ll be working with the positive energy on hand.

"
21 december 2016,aries,"The Sun’s move into the most ambitious part of your chart sets the stage for some early resolution planning. The key is to examine where and how previous plans and goals fell apart or got side tracked. With Mercury retrograde in this part of your chart, the smart ram acknowledges past mistakes and delusions, then wraps up unfinished business. Once you’ve done that you can move forward with confidence and momentum.

"
22 december 2016,aries,"Is it all about “me” or is it all about “we”? A strong Moon-Jupiter conjunction has you questioning a serious relationship. Just how much freedom do you want–or need? This goes for business alliances as well as romantic ones. How to maintain a sense of independence within a partnership could be a big question in the near future. With the take-charge Sun now in your house of ambition, chances are you’re going to be looking out more for #1.

"
23 december 2016,aries,"You’re in quite the mysterious mood with the Moon in sultry Scorpio trining Mars. Your intuition could be operating at an extremely high level, not to mention your libido! It’s the perfect day to get in touch with your deepest thoughts and emotions, to soothe your soul and to connect with someone close.

"
24 december 2016,aries,"Maybe the best present Santa is going to bring you is a huge boost in self-esteem! There’s a “hell, yeah, why not?” kind of a vibe going on as rebellious Uranus in your sign is pushing you to take more risks. When Uranus goes direct in your sign on the 29th it will be all systems “go”.

"
25 december 2016,aries,"Wonderful day for being with people, new faces included. And it’s not because it’s Christmas. Lovely Venus is in your house of networking, forming three sweet angles with other planets. The more the merrier, they say, and that holds true right now. It’s also an excellent day for romance as lucky Jupiter in your commitment zone winks at amorous Venus. Are those wedding bells I’m hearing?
 

"
26 december 2016,aries,"Whose life is it, anyway? A rare opposition between Jupiter and Uranus pits your opinions and dreams against those of people close to you. It may even reach a point where you’re considering moving on from an alliance, be it personal or business. This energy will build as the new moon in your house of ambition and authority arrives on Thursday. You’ll be highly motivated to make big changes in 2017. The question is: who’s going to be with you on your journey?

"
27 december 2016,aries,"That little voice in your head that has been urging you to take more chances is getting louder, Aries. Mars in the house of the subconscious mind is pushing you to live life in a bigger fashion, and with the mighty Sun in your house of ambition, now’s the time to come up with some awesome New Year’s resolutions.

"
28 december 2016,aries,"You’re becoming pretty motivated to get things done, thanks to the high energy Sun in your house of ambition. But don’t try to go it alone. Reach out to people who can help you and that can be a pretty long list: a personal trainer, new housekeeper, booking agent, writing partner, head hunter, doctor, mentor…pick their brains for advice and retain their services if you can afford to do so. When Uranus goes direct tomorrow in your sign, the brakes come off.

"
29 december 2016,aries,"Sweet relief. Uranus ends its retrograde spin in your sign today, ending a five month period of uncertainty and too much juggling. Better yet? The new moon in Capricorn, your house of goal achievement and success. Focus returns and you can apply it to setting those 2017 resolutions.

"
30 december 2016,aries,"Some good things seem to be going on behind the scenes, especially on the work front. Perhaps your name is being mentioned in a favorable way to a decision maker. Or maybe you’re quietly deciding to do something different for a living in 2017. Either way the hush-hush vibe continues into next week, so continue to plot away!

"
31 december 2016,aries,"Ready to plunge in? Planetary aspects recommend taking a risk in love. No, this doesn’t mean dating bad boys or divas. But it does mean being more open to a different kind of lover, or expressing yourself without fear. Being vulnerable is not a weakness; it shows strength of character.

"
1 january 2017,taurus,"Networking with others is the best way to achieve your goals and resolutions for 2017, Taurus! A wonderful Mars-Neptune conjunction encourages you to get out there and mingle. Friends and contacts, both old and new, will be able to help you in so many ways: to find love, more meaningful work, help you contribute to the world via volunteer efforts and simply be an honest source of feedback when you need it. Make it one of your goals to meet as many new people as possible this year!

"
2 january 2017,taurus,"Making new connections and spending fun times with existing friends is on the planets’ agenda for you over the next month, and today is no exception. A positive lunar aspect today could bring about a fortuitous event that involves a close friend, so get on the phone and make plans now. From your chart it appears that an introduction to a new lover could be made, if you’re in the market for love!

"
3 january 2017,taurus,"The hectic pace of the holiday season may start slowing down for you Taurus, now that Venus has just glided into your more relaxed (yet social!) eleventh house. Single bulls may decide to take it easy and release the pressure of finding a new love, at least through the month of January. That being said the possibility of meeting someone is strong; however, you won’t be feeling desperate about it. Coupled up Taureans could invest their time and influence in a volunteer group or a worthy cause. Being around other people is what it’s all about.

"
4 january 2017,taurus,"Devote some time over the next week to reviewing your financial statements and net worth. It’s not because the Tax Man cometh on April 15th. No, Mercury is retrograding today into your house of financial security, urging you to examine your portfolio. Make sure you’re not being over billed for services and that all of the charges on your credit card statements are yours. Better yet, try to negotiate better interest rates on your mortgage and cards. Now’s the time to figure out a plan to pay down debt and save more too.

"
5 january 2017,taurus,"Your emotions could be riding high today, creating a tumultuous situation in which you’re unsure about which way to go. Don’t make any major decisions and wait for the weekend arrive, a much more opportune time for clarity and forward movement. The Sun and Pluto will be meeting in your ninth house of “green lights ahead”, optimism and big picture thinking. Today you’re thinking small. Grab a glass of wine and a book and just chill.

"
6 january 2017,taurus,"Your intuition will be in rare form today, so don’t dismiss what your gut is telling you. And chances are that it will have something to do with a quite personal and emotional matter. You’re about to enter one of the most expansive times in ages, a period in which you could make more progress than you ever dreamed possible. But deal with your demons first. The less baggage you carry, the faster you’ll fly.

"
7 january 2017,taurus,"2017 is not a year for the proud bull to be skulking off to the side of the pasture, watching everyone else have their day in the Sun. Hell, no! And today some major planetary activity is going to light a fire under your butt to get moving. Luckily for you, the Sun and Pluto meet up in one of the most exciting and expansive parts of your chart, the ninth house. This is where you take risks and grow via study, travel and meeting new people with different viewpoints than your own. If there was ever a time to bust out of a rut, this is it!

"
9 january 2017,taurus,"You may have your act together, Taurus, but do the people around you have a clue as to what’s going on? Make sure that everyone knows what their responsibilities are, otherwise you might get stuck doing all of the grunt work. And if someone tries to wrest control of a project or plan in some kind of a head trip, you may have to stand your ground.

"
10 january 2017,taurus,"Say as little as possible today, and keep you eyes open. A tense Uranus-Sun aspect indicates that a frenemy or hidden troll is determined to stir up trouble. Your intuition is strong, but that being said, don’t verbalize your suspicions or annoyance as it could backfire. Sometimes the wisest choice is to say nothing, walk softly and carry a big stick.

"
11 january 2017,taurus,"You’re an idea factory these days Taurus, with transformative and energetic planets blazing trails through the sectors that govern originality, innovation and long range thinking. That’s the good news! The downside is that optimistic Jupiter may be encouraging you to take on too many projects or commitments at once. There simply many not be enough hours in the day. Many self-help gurus say that the smart way to accomplish things is to only take on three goals and work on them until they’re completed, then start in on the rest, a wise piece of advice to consider.

"
12 january 2017,taurus,"You’re ready to close out some projects and goals you’ve been working on so that you can move on to newer ones, and today’s full moon will help you do that. This is an excellent time for taking a class, writing a book, starting a blog, teaching, lecturing and indulging in some shameless self-promotion. Better yet is that quick-witted, intelligent Mercury enters your house of expansive thinking and reaching a wider audience. Just don’t bite off more than you can chew, and make sure that people and services that you’re relying on are staying on top of their end of things.

"
13 january 2017,taurus,"A super romantic Venus-Neptune aspect is a great way to get the weekend rolling. Singles, a friend could make an introduction to a new hottie, and online dating could also be successful (believe it or not). Attached bulls will find it easier to discuss future plans and shared values with someone close, and with Mercury now in your blue-skies-ahead sector, you shouldn’t hold back when it comes to planning.

"
14 january 2017,taurus,"Spend some time this weekend refining your vision about what you’d like to see happen in 2017. Mercury is now in your house of taking in information and thinking outside the box. Then next Thursday the Sun enters Aquarius, your house of achievement. It helps to have the road map drawn up in advance! But don’t forget about love and romance while you’re pondering the future. A sweet aspect in the heavens could bring singles in contact with someone new, while attached bulls should be out mingling with friends and other couples.

"
15 january 2017,taurus,"You only live once, Taurus, but if you do it right once is enough! With magnetic Venus and dynamic Mars both in your house of fun events and new contacts, you need to seize the day. You seem to be wrestling with self-doubt, thinking that you don’t deserve life’s goodies. Hell yeah you do, so go out there and grab them.

"
17 january 2017,taurus,"Some doors seem to be stuck closed while others will swing wide open. Look for the opportunities that you can dive into quickly and don’t fret about the ones you can’t get to right now. The ancients used to say that the cosmos’s delays were not the cosmos’s denials.

"
18 january 2017,taurus,"Your career is just about to take off like a shot, thanks to the mighty Sun blazing into Aquarius on Thursday. To prepare yourself for upcoming advancement, make sure that you’re surrounded by the right kind of people. A productive Mars-Jupiter aspect today will help you work well with team members (even if they’re not cooperative themselves!). Roles may need to be switched up and protocols changed, but it’s necessary for growth. If you’re considering moving on to a new company, networking is a better way to go than just relying on jobs posted on the Internet. It’s now what you know, but who you know.

"
19 january 2017,taurus,"The brakes come off as the Sun barrels into Aquarius, your house of ambition and success. But if you want to move forward you’re going to have to make a decision about the people who may or may not be traveling with you on your journey. Current planetary aspects indicate that not everyone on your “team” is willing to do their share or support your efforts. Is it better to go solo? That’s a decision you’ll be making over the next week, especially around the time of the new moon on the 27th.

"
20 january 2017,taurus,"The mighty bull is scratching the ground, getting ready to charge. That’s because the Sun is now in the most ambitious part of your chart, encouraging you to go after your heart’s desires. The new moon on the 27th is the best time to launch new endeavors. But with megawatt Mars entering your house of secrecy the next day, your best work will be done behind closed doors.

"
21 january 2017,taurus,"Make an effort to work out issues with a lover this weekend as the Moon is in a helpful spot, your house of deeper commitments. A Moon-Chiron trine indicates that it’s time to open up and get clear about long term goals and to make sure that you have the same values. Singles, create a short list of the qualities you want in a mate. Now that the Sun is in your house of ambition and success, you may end up getting just what you want—and need.

"
22 january 2017,taurus,"It’s easy to get into a groove in which we stick with the tried and true, and that includes the people we hang out with. The cosmos recommends that you make an effort to meet some new folks–not that there’s anything wrong with your current pals! But making some fresh connections could help you in big ways, from expanding your mental perspectives to gaining some helpful contacts in love and business. The more the merrier.

"
23 january 2017,taurus,"This entire week is excellent for making long term plans and developing stronger bonds with people, the ones already in your life and the ones you’ve just met. Today is auspicious for having a heart to heart talk with a loved one about what you’d like to see in the future; Tuesday is fine for making new friends and networking; Wednesday helps you connect better with co-workers and group dynamics. It’s all good!

"
24 january 2017,taurus,"It’s wonderful to be surrounded by folks who all seem to enjoy each other’s company and who can work together as a team. Current planetary aspects indicate that the early part of this week is promising for group efforts, whether they’re within the family, your friends or at work. But when the new moon arrives on Friday in the house of your  personal goals and aspirations, these people may suddenly be not as supportive. Just keep your eye on the big picture and soldier on.

"
25 january 2017,taurus,"You may need to learn more to earn more. Transformative Pluto is encouraging you to develop your knowledge base and skill level. But this isn’t just to see more green in your wallet: there’s a happy vibe of curiosity, of learning just for the joy of it. Open up your mind to new philosophies. Read a different kind of a book. Plan a vacation to a far off part of the world that you might not have considered before. Besides, you never know who you might meet along the way.

"
26 january 2017,taurus,"If you want to make progress with your colleagues or a team effort, you’d be wise to coat your words with honey today rather than vinegar. Fortunately smooth-talking Venus is in a good spot to help you. Tomorrow’s new moon falls in your house of ambition, and under current planetary aspects you’re going to need the help of other people, at least for a little while.

"
27 january 2017,taurus,"This is one of the best days in 2017 to kick off new plans, especially if they’re related to your career and making more money. A new moon occurs in your house of goals and success and it’s surrounded by positive aspects. Saturn, the planet of long range planning, is sitting pretty in the financial sector getting ready to show you the money. Abundant Jupiter could bring in new work assignments and better systems for getting things done. Mercury and Pluto are shaking hands in the house that deals with media attention, book deals, or going international. As long as you don’t expect to become a millionaire overnight, you’ll rock it.

"
28 january 2017,taurus,"Remaining discrete is the advice the cosmos sends you as red hot Mars moves into your hush-hush twelfth house. Mars doesn’t necessarily like being contained in such a low key place, but you’d be wise to work quietly behind the scenes over the next few weeks. Yesterday’s new moon fell in your house of career and other ambitious goals. Don’t shout them from the rooftops; slow down, become more reflective, and tie up loose ends.

"
29 january 2017,taurus,"You’re positively visionary! Toss out old ideas and viewpoints and make way for some revolutionary new concepts, Taurus. Your sign is known for sticking to the tried and true, which is excellent when it comes to sticking to good habits and routines. But sometimes you just gotta switch up your way of thinking, and with metamorphic Pluto stirring up your house of thinking outside the box, today’s a good time to open the windows of your mind.

"
30 january 2017,taurus,"Romance is in the air as the passionate Moon and amorous Neptune meet in the heavens. Singles, an introduction from a friend could be just what you need now, although success with online dating is also in the stars. Couples, this is a good day to share your ideas about the future and discuss the next steps. You’re in more of a take charge mood these days, Taurus, so don’t sit back and wait for things to happen.

"
31 january 2017,taurus,"Sometimes you just have to just go with what feels right and push past your fears, and that’s what the cosmos is telling you to do today. Intelligent Mercury is opening up you mind to new ideas—are you open to trying them? A lack of confidence could arise, or a little voice saying “I tried that before and it didn’t work.” Well this time it just might, but you’ll never know unless you try, right?

"
1 february 2017,taurus,"Co-workers or clients could be in a button-pushing mood, Taurus, and you may need to summon up a mountain of patience in order to deal with them. Trouble is, the Moon could make you quite emotional today, or suspicious. Even if someone isn’t in your face you could sense some resistance coming from them. Let this pass and wait until next Monday if you can, when Jupiter goes retrograde in your house of work. You’ll be able to figure out what’s going on with much greater clarity.

"
2 february 2017,taurus,"A more tender touch should be used in personal relationships, especially when it comes to kids or a lover. Sometimes we have to switch up our methods of motivating others, communicating with them and just showing them love, and that’s what the cosmos is telling you to do today. Mars is pushing you to do some helpful inner work that will make life flow so much easier; pay attention!

"
3 february 2017,taurus,"50 Shades of Taurus? Now that amorous Venus is in your house of mystery, secrets and uh, forbidden fruit, you could enjoy quite a libidinous February. Singles, just make sure that you’re not being seduced 100% by someone’s sex appeal if what you’re really looking for is commitment and a soulmate. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with a damn sexy soulmate, so happy hunting.

"
4 february 2017,taurus,"Bill Gates and people of his ilk are often referred to as being “visionaries”, but that title just doesn’t apply to a select few. Your ability to see a much bigger picture skyrockets today with a sparkling Moon-Pluto trine. The Moon is in your house of self, so it all comes down to making the most of what lies within. When intelligent Mercury enters your ambition sector next week, all systems are go.

"
5 february 2017,taurus,"Mixed signals coming from someone close might make you feel unsettled, but this is a temporary blip. Over the next two months you’ll be doing a lot of soul searching now that Venus is in the house of your subconscious mind and emotions. As a result, you’ll have your good days and the more challenging ones, but in the end you’ll emerge a happier, more serene person. Besides, once Mercury enters your house of ambition on Tuesday you’ll become more focused on your own plans and not so engaged in the dramas that other people create.
.

"
6 february 2017,taurus,"The stalwart bull likes to plunge ahead, knocking down obstacles and making progress. But the cosmos is urging you to take a slower pace between now and early June, thanks to Jupiter going retrograde today in your house of work assignments and efficiency. Tighten up policies and procedures, let go of dead wood employees, switch service providers that aren’t responsive to your needs, and consider your own personal work habits. You’ll need to take action ASAP as Mercury enters your house of ambition tomorrow.

"
7 february 2017,taurus,"Reach out to mentors and the powers that be, Taurus. Mercury just entered your achievement sector and you’d be wise to hear the opinions of experts before you make your next move. This isn’t just about career success, although it can mean that. Being a better parent, losing weight, making smart investments, breaking a bad habit–all of these qualify as “achievement”. There is plenty of sound advice out there–seek it.

"
8 february 2017,taurus,"A project could go off the rails today, Taurus, but the good news is that you can get it back on track tomorrow. Whether it’s a diet, home remodeling plan, a client presentation or group effort at the office, it looks like things are moving too fast. Tighten them up, keep your opinions to yourself and don’t lose focus on the end result.

"
9 february 2017,taurus,"A quick “psychic hit” could come your way today, and the news it brings will have to do with your bigger ambitions. Your intuition is your best friend right now, thanks to hosting magnetic Venus and spontaneous Uranus in the house of the subconscious mind. They’re both going to be active over the next three days so pay attention to your gut.

"
10 february 2017,taurus,"Homebody? A new series of eclipses in Leo begins tonight in your domestic sector, stretching all the way into 2019. Let’s put it this way: your family life and residential situation will be dramatically  different within two years’ time. Moving to a new town, getting engaged, starting a family, handling issues with your parents and siblings—all of these will be on the table. The job of an eclipse is to get us out of a rut and they tend to act quickly. The current one is a honey, helping you get organized at home and possibly line up money for a down payment on a house or a security deposit. There are excellent career aspects too, so plan an interview if you’re looking for more cash and responsibility.

"
11 february 2017,taurus,"You have what it takes, Taurus. A super Sun-Jupiter trine will enable you to show off your talents and skills in the workplace over the next week. Schedule job interviews and client presentations. Dive into a new aspect of the business that you haven’t tried before. Tackling new projects should be easier, not to mention profitable in the long run.

"
12 february 2017,taurus,"“I’m a lover, not a fighter.” This may be your mantra today as the emotional Moon opposes Neptune. If people around you want to create drama, whether it’s a pal, spouse or family member, walk away. Let them wallow in their own theatrics. You’ve got better things to do with your time.

"
13 february 2017,taurus,"You may need to switch up your approach when it comes to a project you’re working on, as the cosmos suggests that more creativity is needed. It doesn’t matter whether you’re redecorating your bedroom or working on a client presentation–try a fresh idea, a different way of going about things. You’ll be happy you did as you’ll end up seeing more favorable results right away, especially over the next two weeks.

"
14 february 2017,taurus,"A sweet cooperative vibe pervades this Valentine’s Day, Taurus. With mature Saturn in the sector that governs your most intimate emotions, you should really be on target with your feelings. There’s no room in your life right now for jealousy, resentment or drama in love. If a romance needs to get straightened out then you’re the person to do it, as the Sun is in the most authoritative part of your chart. You’re responsible for your own personal happiness—remember that.

"
15 february 2017,taurus,"Your confidence may rise over a business success. Perhaps you’re going to win that promotion, or a new client is getting ready to sign on the dotted line. Maybe you just feel as though you’re becoming a stronger player. Kudos! But you might want to keep it humble, even subdued, as there could be a hidden troll in your midst. Don’t give away too much, not only today but all the way through the end of next week. Your aspects for success are excellent but confidentiality is key.

"
16 february 2017,taurus,"You’re more than ready to tackle new things thanks to a strong Mercury-Mars meeting. If your life needs more structure you’ll be able to develop it, which includes solid habits and systems for getting things done. But Rome wasn’t built in a day, so don’t try to completely overhaul your life in too short a period of time.

"
17 february 2017,taurus,"Be selective when it comes to choosing people to partner with, whether its on a personal level or a business one. With the Sun about to enter the friendliest part of your chart you may be ready to welcome everyone with open arms. However, some folks are just not a good fit. Your intuition is working in high gear—use it to your advantage.

"
18 february 2017,taurus,"Who’s on Team Taurus? That’s the big question over the next four weeks as the Sun enters your house of networking today. With a solar eclipse occurring here on the 26th, the last one in a series that has been going on since 2015, it may be time for some new faces and connections. Group efforts that have been going on for awhile may now finally come to a successful close.

"
19 february 2017,taurus,"It’s a honey of a day for spiritual clearing. If you’ve been critical of yourself, always seeing the flaws and not the beauty that resides within you, today’s Moon-Venus trine will help you change your viewpoint. Make a vow to be better to yourself–and kinder.

"
20 february 2017,taurus,"This is one of your best weeks in ages to make a good impression on others, thanks to intelligent, eloquent Mercury in your house of ambition. Today it forms a brilliant aspect with Uranus, the planet of genius–and fast results. As a result, if you have an idea or plan that you believe is worthwhile, then you must take action on it. Better yet–showcase it to people who are decision makers.

"
21 february 2017,taurus,"Ready, aim, fire! Get your ducks lined up because a profitable Mercury-Jupiter trine bodes well for taking an idea from the conceptual arena to the planning stage. Plot out what needs to be done, then get moving. Great day to impress a boss with your can-do attitude.

"
22 february 2017,taurus,"Walk softly and carry a big stick. The two most obstinate planets, Mars and Pluto, are squaring off in the heavens, bringing about a power grab on the part of someone you know. Observe, deduce but don’t act. Keep your words and opinions to yourself. This isn’t weakness–it’s actually strength. This battle is not worth fighting, at least not now.

"
23 february 2017,taurus,"Are you on the right path when it comes to your career? Today both your logical side and creative one will be holding a conversation about your future. With Sunday’s lunar eclipse falling in your house of deeply held dreams, you may be on the verge of making a major decision.

"
24 february 2017,taurus,"What you are interested in doing may not mesh with what others have in mind, but that doesn’t mean that you should cave to their wishes. On the contrary! A secretive Venus-Moon aspect today tells you to pursue your own plans without making a big noise about it. But over the next few weeks you would be wise to at least look like a team player.

"
25 february 2017,taurus,"Collaborations pick up steam now that clever Mercury is in your house of team activities. Not only can you make purpose-filled new affiliations, you can also share good times with your friends. A solar eclipse tomorrow in this part of your chart will bring in many new faces, so get ready to join forces with like-minded people.

"
26 february 2017,taurus,"The best way for you to get ahead in life is by joining forces with others. Taurus. A solar eclipse in your house of networking suggests that friends, colleagues, former bosses, and neighbors can bring you what you need: new love, a higher paying job, more friends, and people who share your values. Charitable work and social action are highly favored, so don’t just sit there–call a friend!

"
27 february 2017,taurus,"First, the good news: your intuition is working double overtime, providing you with information that’s valuable. Now for the less-than-stellar news: you may be realizing (thanks to the sixth sense) that someone doesn’t have your back, or that a circumstance just doesn’t fit you anymore. This could turn to anger pretty quickly, so think before you speak or act.

"
28 february 2017,taurus,"Growing pains. You might be feeling them today as metamorphic Pluto encourages you to break out of a rut or your shell, yet gentle Venus is warning “Wait! I’m not ready!” Honey, you can’t stay in the shadows too much longer. Megawatt Mars is about to enter your sign on March 9th, its first visit here in two years. Get your act together, dust yourself off and get ready to be on center stage.

"
1 march 2017,taurus,"Work that contact list! A super Sun-Neptune aspect rocks for making progress with the help of others. Team projects, volunteer groups, industry think tanks—all of these can be your ticket to a brighter and more fulfilled future. Tech ventures are highly favored too, so redesign your website, launch a social media campaign or even consider online dating for finding new love.

"
3 march 2017,taurus,"Out with the old, in with the new. The saying “but we’ve always done it this way” needs to be removed from your brain! A cosmic shakeup is pushing you to think outside the box and consider new options. A luscious Moon-Pluto trine today is perfect for not only making a few tweaks, but a major metamorphosis.

"
4 march 2017,taurus,"Need some down time to lick your wounds? The next four weeks are perfect for cocooning yourself away from the world a bit and indulging in some extreme self-care. This is a healing time when you can overcome grief, resentment and negativity. Forgive, release and move on. You can do this on your own, but a therapist, minister or trusted confidante could also be a big help.

"
5 march 2017,taurus,"Your psychological health is just as important as your physical vitality, and today you can take great strides in cleansing your mind of what ails you. This may entail opening up and spilling your emotions and thoughts to someone, but the end result will be worth it. Meditation, energy work, affirmations, visualization: all of these are tools that will help you.

6 march 2017,taurus,"It’s an excellent day to forge a dynamic connection. Join a professional group, socialize, make new friends and consider joining a team of like-minded individuals. This energy will continue all week, so keep your radar up. The contacts you make right now can add to the quality of your life in so many ways.

"
7 march 2017,taurus,"Teamwork is the planets’ focus for you this week, Taurus. But today you may need to tiptoe around others, or keep your opinion to yourself. You have some excellent ideas and insights, but other people may not be ready for them. Wait until Wednesday to share.

"
8 march 2017,taurus,"There is nothing  holding you back, Taurus! Where there’s a will there’s a way, and with the two most optimistic and forward-thinking sectors lit up, you’ll be able to figure out how to get past obstacles. This energy continues into Thursday when….a drumroll, please…Mars enters your sign. Stop feeling sorry for yourself or think you don’t have what it takes. You do. Find a way.

"
9 march 2017,taurus,"Yeah, baby! Mars is now in Taurus, making you the guy or gal to watch. Take this energy and run with it. Ask for the business, ask for the date, showcase your talents, make new friends, lose some weight, speak up, socialize and overall, have some fun. You just have to watch the tendency to become too bull-headed. Remember that your dreams, passions and timelines may not be the same as someone else’s.

"
10 march 2017,taurus,"Invite some friends over for dinner or drinks this weekend, Taurus. The planets are encouraging you to socialize more with people who truly understand and appreciate you. And with Sunday’s full moon falling in your house of romance, plan a sexy rendezvous with your amour. No amour in sight? The full moon could put an end to that situation! Pals could play matchmaker under these aspects—just one more reason to invite them over.

"
11 march 2017,taurus,"Don’t let others talk you out of your dreams, Taurus! Friends and family may mean well but you know in your heart what is best for you. A highly creative and convivial time is about to open up in your life, thanks to Sunday’s full moon in Virgo. You can’t travel to a distant new land if you don’t leave the shore.

"
12 march 2017,taurus,"Sweet! A full moon glows in your house of romance and enjoying life, Taurus. But while you’re busy wining, dining and canoodling, make sure that you’re coming from the same place as your lover. A tense Mercury-Saturn aspect indicates that you can’t gloss over such an important facet of a relationship. Singles, unless you’re looking for a quick fling, take your time when dating someone new. That said, this lunation could bring in a fresh prospect.

"
13 march 2017,taurus,"Sit with your emotions, Taurus. Sift through old baggage and forgive the transgressions of others so that you can heal and move on. Intelligent Mercury enters the house of your subconscious mind today, setting the stage for mental healing. The next few weeks are a good time to begin a meditation practice and take time alone for yourself every day.

"
14 march 2017,taurus,"Snark alert. Stay on your toes at the office, school or in a team activity as it appears that someone will be working their own agenda. The problem is that with a Moon-Jupiter conjunction you may be so optimistic and open-minded that you won’t be able to see it. Of course, if someone openly goes on a power trip, you’ll know it. Be watchful and remain calm.

"
15 march 2017,taurus,"With the recent full moon falling in your house of romance, you may be thinking about what you can do to improve your love life. And with red hot Mars confidently striding through your house of image, one of the best places to start is with your own level of self esteem. It may be time for an emotional makeover, something you can start once the Sun enters Aries on the 20th.

"
16 march 2017,taurus,"Sober Saturn in your house of intimacy demands more maturity and peace in your relationship. That includes you singles who are on the market; no more divas and players! All bulls will be seeking clarity, especially with tomorrow’s tough Sun-Saturn meet up. It’s crucial to be upon the same page as a lover. They need to share your goals and values, otherwise it may be time to move on.

"
17 march 2017,taurus,"Getting a solid grip on your finances is the order of the day with a sobering Sun-Saturn square. The size of your dreams may currently not match the size of your bank account, as disciplinarian Saturn will point out. Does this mean you should give up on cherished ideas? Heck no! But start doing some deep thinking about how you can change the way you’re going about saving, spending, investing and earning money.

"
18 march 2017,taurus,"Secret lover? Hmmm. With Mercury holding a convo with romantic Venus in your hush-hush twelfth house, sexy bulls could be considering an affair! Or maybe a secluded weekend in the boudoir with your Significant Other. Singles, you could be harboring a secret crush…or perhaps someone is crushing on you.

"
19 march 2017,taurus,"From your chart it appears that you have some big decisions to make, some of which are life changing. When the Sun enters Aries tomorrow you’ll be entering a highly reflective phase. But you can get started today with resolutions concerning your net worth as well as your romance, thanks to the Moon touching these areas. There is no need to make a decision now, but at least start ruminating.

"
20 march 2017,taurus,"Craving privacy? Feel the need to unwind, rest and reflect? That’s because the Sun has just entered your twelfth house of healing and closure. The next four weeks can be highly cathartic if you set your mind to it–literally. Learn how to meditate, talk to a therapist or close confidante, keep a dream journal or study Buddhism. Use any modality that helps you get centered and happy again.

"
21 march 2017,taurus,"An inspirational Moon-Pluto connection helps you think on grander terms, and with this mind-expanding vibe could come the desire to learn more. Sign up for a class or seminar. Listen to podcasts or pick up some good books on a topic of interest to you. Just don’t rush the process, expecting to have answers or be an expert in record time. Practice makes perfect here.

"
22 march 2017,taurus,"You may be raring to go with any number of opportunities but the sensible thing to do right now is nothing. That is until you’ve given plenty of thought to which plan or idea is the best one to pursue over the next few weeks. Your intuition is strong today–use it for guidance.

"
23 march 2017,taurus,"You would be wise to keep cutting edge ideas to yourself, as other people around you may be more than happy to either claim them for their own or try to stymie your progress. While you’re at it, keep your opinions to yourself too. A tough Mercury-Pluto aspect indicates that someone may be lurking in the shadows, operating at cross purposes to you. Don’t get them any ammunition to use against you.

"
24 march 2017,taurus,"Don’t kid yourself about what you can accomplish in a given time period, whether it’s a project at home or work. Optimistic Jupiter may have you thinking that you can take on the world. However, rational Mercury is saying otherwise, so get real about commitments and your schedule. You may have to cut certain obligations and activities in order to focus on just a few that are the most important.

"
25 march 2017,taurus,"You’re in a powerfully transitional time right now, Taurus. Sometimes making big decisions or changes is tough, but other times it’s easy. Luckily sweet Venus meets up with the authoritative Sun today, allowing changes to happen without a lot of fear, drama and resistance. Momentum will build over the next three weeks.

"
26 march 2017,taurus,"Intuition alert! Yours will be spot on today with a meeting of two of the most mental planets, Mercury and Uranus, in the house of the subconscious mind. Something might hit you—an idea, an emotion, a suspicion, a glimpse of what lies in the future—and it may come quickly, out of the blue. Don’t dismiss these thoughts; they are gifts from the cosmos.

"
27 march 2017,taurus,"With Mars in your sign you are unstoppable, Taurus. Today the red planet forms a glistening aspect with inspirational Neptune in your house of dreams and wishes. It’s the perfect time to envision the future and what you’d like to experience in the months and years ahead. Tuesday’s new moon is all about releasing parts of your past that are no longer useful or may be holding you back. You can’t voyage to new lands unless you’re willing to leave the shore.

"
28 march 2017,taurus,"Some serious R & R is on the cosmos’s agenda for you, Taurus. If you’ve been putting in long hours at work, or relationships with others have been causing stress, it’s time to relax, regroup and recharge your batteries. The new moon in Aries urges you to cleanse your weary soul of trouble, especially the romantic kind as love planet Venus is in a good angle.

"
29 march 2017,taurus,"Inspiration for building your net worth could arrive today in the form of a gut hunch or a dream. As a result, don’t discount ideas that pop into your head or what appears to be a random remark from someone you know. The good thing is that logical Saturn is in the house of your subconscious mind, so these hunches will be based on fact and not on fantasy.

"
30 march 2017,taurus,"With Mars in Taurus you may be feeling self-assured and extremely motivated, but you have to remember that not everyone else is. Avoid the tendency to push people too hard, too fast when it comes to getting things done, whether it’s at home or at the office. You may also be pushing yourself too hard, so dial things down a notch. Don’t worry—everything will be completed eventually.

"
31 march 2017,taurus,"Woo-hoo! Magnetic Mercury, the planet that helps you speak with eloquence and makes your mind as sharp as a tack, enters Taurus today. Better yet is that it joins Mars, the most assertive planet in the solar system. This is a terrific time to speak up for yourself, plan the next phase of your life, negotiate business deals or a new job, or reinvent your image. But hustle, because Mercury retrogrades here on April 9th.

"
1 april 2017,taurus,"Phew! The last six weeks may have been onerous, courtesy of Venus moving backward through one of the most sensitive parts of your chart. Hopefully you’ve released grudges and resentment, especially the kind directed at old flames. Toss that torch you’ve been carrying and get ready to meet someone new. Coupled up bulls should have worked on their issues as well. Venus moves into your house of values and cherished dreams tomorrow, so plan to make a decision as to what is really important to you.

"
2 april 2017,taurus,"You may need to make amends with a friend, but it will be worth the discomfort. Now that magnetic Venus is retrograding through your house of close contacts, it’s time to reconnect with people you’ve lost touch with–and those with whom there’s been some friction. Once Venus resumes direct motion on the 15th you should be enjoying a far more social scene.

"
3 april 2017,taurus,"You may be in a candid mood, ready to open up and express your opinions and ideas, but the planets warn against being too transparent. Keep some of your cards close to your vest. That said, be a part of a team, chat with your friends and have a discussion with your lover. Just be circumspect with the amount of kind of information you release.

"
4 april 2017,taurus,"Your emotions might get the better of you, so think before you act or talk. Ungrounded fears might be making you concerned about the future. Your heart and head will be sending mixed messages, so this is definitely not a good time to make any major decisions. When logical Saturn begins to retrograde in your house of emotions and deepest thoughts on Thursday you’ll have the time to think things through.

"
5 april 2017,taurus,"Playing nice with family members and friends can be a blessing for all of you. You can make the day of someone who is going through a hard time, and in doing so you’ll end up feeling such a sense of contentment. The best part is that they’ll be there for you when you need it.

"
6 april 2017,taurus,"Romantic liaisons take a serious turn now that mature Saturn is retrograding in your house of intimacy. The next few months are critical for getting to the root of any problems in your relationship. Singles should get clear about what they want from a partner, and all bulls need to let go of drama, jealousy and past wounds. Will your romance survive? Saturn is the planet of the long term, so if your union is strong it should last.

"
7 april 2017,taurus,"If you feel like being a doormat or a work horse, then today’s your day. Others will be glad to dump on you if you allow them to. If, however, you have healthy self-esteem and boundaries, you’ll need to let those qualities show. With so much planetary activity in your efficiency zone you’re looking like a can-do person, which can have its downside. Don’t let others assume that you’re dying to take on more work.

"
8 april 2017,taurus,"The button pushers are out there today and they might have you in their cross hairs, Taurus! Be wary of people who seem to have an axe to grind, want to stir up drama or push you around. The problem is that the more you respond the worse it will get. If you can, just grab a good book and hide away somewhere—or go to a day spa for an extensive set of treatments.

"
9 april 2017,taurus,"Time for some self-reflection! Intelligent Mercury just went retrograde in your sign, forcing you to examine your thoughts, beliefs and plans. While you may feel misunderstood and perhaps even unappreciated in the weeks ahead, you can still make progress. Between now and the 20th focus less on what other think and want and more on what floats your boat.

"
10 april 2017,taurus,"With optimistic Jupiter in your house of productivity this is an excellent time to figure out the most important things that need to be done. But in order to do that you need to drown out the voices of people who are weighing in with their opinions. Only you can create a short list.

"
11 april 2017,taurus,"New life is breathed into work assignments and other plans as a full moon illuminates the heavens. It occurs in your detail-oriented sector of efficiency, giving you the can-do attitude to get things done. Just be aware that you may be flying solo, as others are either unwilling to help or stuck in their own vision of how things should progress. That’s OK–you can make faster progress if their baggage isn’t holding you back.

"
12 april 2017,taurus,"Working well with others isn’t always easy, and indeed the planets are encouraging you to do as much as you can on your own. But it wouldn’t hurt to at least pretend that you’re interested in being a team player, at least for the next few days. When Venus stations direct on Saturday people will become more cooperative.

"
13 april 2017,taurus,"Your desire to take a bold risk is increasing, Taurus, but this may mean making a break from the past. So be it. Today’s a good time to talk over your new ideas with the people closest to you to see if they’re on board. Once Venus resumes direct motion on Saturday it will be even easier to reach an agreement and rally the troops.

"
14 april 2017,taurus,"I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more! That old line is your mantra today as rebellious Uranus pushes you to the breaking point. It could be an unfulfilling job or relationship. The face that you can’t zip your pants anymore due to the gut roll. A person who keeps putting you down. Dependency on cigarettes or another unhealthy substance. The time to change is now, Taurus. What are you waiting for?

"
15 april 2017,taurus,"Yassss. Love planet Venus goes direct after a four-week back spin, easing relationships not only with an amour but also friends and colleagues. Momentum can start to build in team efforts, such as a departmental task at the office or planning a wedding, family reunion or charity event. There will always be friction of some kind in a group activity, but Venus’s direct turn will give you the gift of diplomacy.

"
16 april 2017,taurus,"Romance takes a sexy turn with the two cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, in a sweet angle today. A friend could play matchmaker to you singles, and online dating sites could also produce (gasp!) a winner. Coupled up bulls will find it easier to discuss the big picture with their amour. With the Sun getting ready to enter your sign it’s a great time to think about what you’d like to experience over the next year.

"
17 april 2017,taurus,"Dig deep, Taurus, deep into your emotions. If you need to release any bad mojo today’s the day to do so. A powerful meeting between two no-nonsense orbs, the Sun and Saturn, encourages you to release old mental traumas and let them go. Saturn is the planet of discipline and the long term, so its presence is important for making things stick.

"
18 april 2017,taurus,"You can’t force enthusiasm to just pour out of you if you’re not really feeling it. The good news is that the Sun is about to enter your sign, getting you jazzed up to chase down some exciting dreams. But Pluto retrogrades Thursday in your visionary ninth house, which might make you pause and wonder if you’re on the right track. Don’t let Pluto’s retro turn dampen your optimism. Instead, use it to refine your vision.

"
19 april 2017,taurus,"Happy birthday Taurus! Now that the Sun is crowning you the celestial favorite of the zodiac for the next four weeks you can try your hand at all sorts of new experiences, meet fresh faces and party your little heart out. However, make sure to book some down time for nurturing and pampering yourself. With Mercury about to retrograde in the most secluded part of your chart, it’s the perfect opportunity to practice some extreme self care.

"
20 april 2017,taurus,"A big concept is no better than the sum of its parts, something that you would be wise to remember over the next few months. Pluto retrogrades in your big-picture-thinking sector, urging you to ferret out weaknesses in a plan or project. This little planet demands that shaky foundations be torn down, but the upside is that it will help you rebuild with fortitude. Slow and steady will win out over fast and sloppy.

"
21 april 2017,taurus,"Hope you’re well-rested. Mars enters your income sector, helping you pull on more dinero through your own business, a raise or a brand new job. But when the red planet enters this part of someone’s chart it often demands long hours, more cooperation with co-workers and clients, and sometimes punishing deadlines. Considering that both Mercury and Pluto went retrograde yesterday, you’ll need to resist the urge to blast forward with projects. Take your time and do things right.

"
22 april 2017,taurus,"The size of your wallet may not match the size of your dreams, Taurus. Luxe Venus is aching to spend some cash: not necessarily on extras but big ticket items, like a house, car, boat or even funding your own business. While there’s nothing wrong with pursuing your dreams, serious Saturn is telling you to bank more cash and pay down debt before you go down that path.

"
23 april 2017,taurus,"Friends with benefits? It could happen today, Taurus! Of course whether that’s a smart idea or not is another story. With the Moon and love planet Venus linking up in your friendship sector, anything could happen, such as a pal introducing you to a new hottie. Online dating could also work out, believe it or not. Couples might find that it’s more fun to socialize with friends rather than spending the day with just your amour.

"
24 april 2017,taurus,"Take off the rose colored glasses. Stop placing someone on a pedestal. Drop the resentment and grudges. Stern Saturn tells you to delete the negative and sometimes foolish thoughts that we entertain when it comes to love, whether they’re around a current amour or an ex. The good news is that if you make the effort to do this inner work, the results will stick.

"
25 april 2017,taurus,"Catharsis! A surprising breakthrough can occur which will help you release some of the troublesome bonds of the past. Tomorrow’s new moon falls in your sign, Taurus, and other planets are working hard to empty your mind and soul of toxic trash so that you can move forward with confidence. Create some healthy new habits, such as repeating affirmations in the morning or meditating. Disciplinarian Saturn is in a good spot to help you stick to them and reap the rewards of a clear mind.

"
26 april 2017,taurus,"Your personal new year begins today, thanks to a luscious new moon in your sign, Taurus. Spontaneous Uranus is acting out in a good way, telling you to toss out preconceived notions as to what you’re capable of. There’s a strong healing vibe in the air, so let the past go and charge forward like the stalwart bull that you are. Once Venus changes signs on Friday your imagination and intuition will increase dramatically, so use these skills to help plan the next phase of your life.

"
27 april 2017,taurus,"Hurry up and wait? The new moon in Taurus yesterday kicked off a six-month period in which you can pursue any goal of your choosing, and today you may feel like a kid in a candy shop as you consider the possibilities. A Moon-Pluto trine is helping you think big and bold, but don’t blast forward just yet. An impatient approach will lead to mistakes. Slow down and consider all of your options.

"
28 april 2017,taurus,"Romantic Venus glides into the dreamiest part of your chart, which stirs up fantasies and the desire to bond with another. Which is fine….as long as you’re keeping it real. Besides, the recent new moon occurred in your sign, which puts your needs front and center. Don’t be shy about having expectations from someone you love. Otherwise you’ll end up being a doormat.

"
29 april 2017,taurus,"There’s no place for emotional spending this weekend with a sobering Moon-Saturn aspect. Keep your credit cards in your wallet and avoid car, boat and furniture showrooms. Mars is tearing through your house of money. Unfortunately, it can tear through your savings too. Play it safe instead.

"
30 april 2017,taurus,"With the Sun in your sign it’s all systems go when it comes to achieving personal projects that are important to you. Today is a winner for seeking advice, strategizing, doing research or rubbing elbows with folks who can help you. Don’t rush this process, however. Now that Venus is in your hush-hush house of confidential planning, you need to be circumspect about just how much you share.

"
1 may 2017,taurus,"Your intuition is razor sharp today, thanks to a powerful meeting of intelligent Mercury and vibey Uranus. Indeed, you might end up being amazed at the kind of information your gut provides you with. But no matter how strongly you feel it, or how accurate you think it is, keep it to yourself. This is not the time for venting.

"
2 may 2017,taurus,"Your self-esteem gets a boost thanks to a sweet lunar aspect that is designed to help you release some of the negativity of the past. Considering that Mercury has been retrograde for several weeks in the house of the subconscious mind, you may have been doing some inner work. It moves direct tomorrow, so get ready to face the world with a brand new attitude.

"
4 may 2017,taurus,"The Sun is shining in Taurus Land, putting your dreams on center stage. And what a day it is to dream! A glorious Sun-Neptune trine stirs up your creative juices as you consider all sorts of yummy possibilities for the future, in all areas of your life. Inspirational Neptune opens up the floodgates to the realm of hidden wisdom that exists in the ether. Let it pour in.

"
5 may 2017,taurus,"Reconsider your productivity level. Are you truly getting things done as efficiently as possible, both at home and at work? Is your life relatively stress free because you have good systems in place? If not, it’s time to get real and make some changes. Fortunately they’ll be easier to implement than you might expect as optimistic, abundant Jupiter is in your house of getting things done.

"
6 may 2017,taurus,"Feeling emo? Not surprising with today’s Moon-Saturn square. Saturn demands maturity and logic and happens to be in one of the houses that governs our deepest thoughts and feelings. So while one part of you may feel like going on a crying jag, pitching a fit, acting jealous or demanding answers from someone, the ringed planet tells you to snap out of it. Now.

"
7 may 2017,taurus,"Over the next week you may realize that the “rules” governing a friendship or team effort need to be rewritten. With the Sun in your sign your self-esteem is rising and you’re less willing to put up with people’s nonsense or lack of work ethic. Today’s a good time to diplomatically try to make changes. Otherwise things could get heated by the 11th.

"
8 may 2017,taurus,"Your head and your heart may be at odds today, and from your chart it looks like your logical left brain is going to win this battle. Intelligent Mercury is zipping through the sector of the subconscious mind, pumping up your intuition. As a result you may be able to read between the lines of what people are saying. Wisdom, not emotion, should guide your decisions.

"
9 may 2017,taurus,"You’re in brainiac mode these days, Taurus, what with the Sun in your sign and Mercury in the house of the subconscious mind. Ideas may be popping up left and right and some of them have incredible long term potential, something that might become apparent today. The next few days are excellent for showcasing and promoting your ideas to power brokers, not to mention landing media attention. Don’t hold back.

"
10 may 2017,taurus,"Serious commitments of all kinds are in the spotlight of tonight’s full moon in Scorpio. Mercury and maverick Uranus are meeting up in the heavens too, in the deepest part of your subconscious mind. This means that you may decide to suddenly walk away from a situation that is burdensome or toxic, such as a romance that’s been on the rocks or a business alliance that’s more trouble than it’s worth. The good news is that you’re in quite a visionary place these days so your decisions will be far reaching. This includes the decision to marry, start a family or enter into a business partnership that could end up being quite profitable.

"
11 may 2017,taurus,"Don’t hold back! A super trine, the best angle possible in astrology, occurs today between the Sun and Pluto. Picture these two as strategists who are holding a powwow, determined to bust you out of a rut and kick your sorry butt into an exciting new stratosphere. The best part is that this won’t be a fantasy land full of unicorns and rainbows: it will be the real world, just at a much higher playing field. Pack your bags.

"
12 may 2017,taurus,"Mars is making you more determined than ever to develop better habits, especially when it comes to earning or saving more dinero. And today it forms a magnificent trine with optimistic Jupiter in your efficiency sector. This is the perfect weekend to go through financial statements, balance your checkbook and strategize as to how you can boost your income. Generous Jupiter is in fine form, trying to land you better clients, work assignments, a nicer office environment and perhaps even a new gig. Don’t waste this valuable energy.

"
13 may 2017,taurus,"Which is going to win—your emotions or your logic? They’re at odds today, but at least it’s a minor altercation and not an out-and-out brawl. With the Sun in your sign you are redefining who you are and what you want to do with your life. Different possibilities are bubbling to the surface of your mind—thus the confusion. When Mercury enters your sign next Tuesday things will become more clear.

"
14 may 2017,taurus,"You shouldn’t be doing all the heavy lifting and grunt work, whether it’s at home, at work or within a volunteer organization you’re part of. And you won’t have to, thanks to a sweet aspect in the heavens that is telling you that teamwork is the way to go. “Yeah, right” you may be saying, “You don’t know what my co-workers are like. Or my kids.” Listen, inspirational Neptune is trying to help you, along with optimistic Jupiter. Create rules and consequences at home, stop being the office go-to person, search for hacks that will reduce your time doing chores or speed up your work flow. Megamouth Mercury enters your sign on Tuesday. Speak up!

"
15 may 2017,taurus,"Yikes, get out of Taurus’s way today. They’re not pissed—they’re passionate.  A powerful meet up of the emotional Moon and determined Pluto in the most adventurous part of their chart is making them more than ready to bust out of a rut. It doesn’t matter where that rut may be—love, career, friendships, body image, finances—but they’re gonna move on.

"
16 may 2017,taurus,"No hiding in the shadows for you, Taurus. Today Mercury enters your sign, making you the guy or the gal with the right attitude, magnetism and ideas. Then on Saturday the Sun enters Gemini, kicking off a four-week period in which you can network for any purpose you have in mind: finding new love or a new gig, talking to movers and shakers about an entrepreneurial venture, meeting the neighbors or getting involved in charity work. A busy, social time lies ahead, so get rested now!

"
17 may 2017,taurus,"If you need to rally the troops (your kids, co-workers, team members) today’s the day to start making inspirational speeches. You will actually be able to gain control over a situation and steer it to a successful finale without overtly pressuring people to get things done. This is the “iron hand in the velvet glove” routine so use it to your advantage.

"
19 may 2017,taurus,"If improving your mindset has been difficult to do, along with breaking bad habits and cutting toxic ties, today is a game changer. A rare Saturn-Uranus aspect takes place that can bring an epiphany, a sudden realization that change is possible. Are you going to have to do some inner work? Yes. Might you need the wise counsel of a therapist, friend or minister? Maybe. But the good news is that between now and mid-November these two planets will be in a close, cathartic angle. Take advantage of it, my friend.

"
20 may 2017,taurus,"Cha-ching! The proud bull loves that sound (don’t we all?) but your sign is the most likely to latch on to cash. And fortunately for you, the Sun enters your earnings sector today for a four-week stay. This happens every year in May, but what makes 2017 different is that aggressive Mars is in the same house. This can act as a double edged sword: you can be spending like a drunken sailor on shore leave, or you can be hustling like mad to line up new sources of income while you build up your savings. There will be a new moon in this sector next Thursday, so get ready to launch job hunts, businesses or income streams then.

"
21 may 2017,taurus,"With glamorous Venus in the most hush-hush part of your chart, it’s time to get a makeover going–on the sly. Listen, do all 537 of your Facebook friends need to know about the diet, exercise regimen or “tweaking” at the dermatologists’ office? Hell no! Besides, you should never underestimate how much fun it is to shock people with a brand new look and attitude.

"
22 may 2017,taurus,"Who said that fantasies were a bad thing? Sometimes the word “fantasy” gets a bad rap as it conjures up images of unicorns and fairies and delusional people who think that their favorite movie star will appear on their doorstep and marry them. But today you can day dream your little heart out, and your ideas may actually have legs. With the new moon later this week in your practical, let’s-get-this-done house, a fantasy could become reality.

23 may 2017,taurus,"Pushy, pushy! Aggressive Mars is waving a red flag at you, bull, and you may be way  too interested in getting things done pronto. Like: having that diamond ring slipped on your finger; landing that raise and the corner office; or losing weight and getting fit. Problem is, we all know what happens when we push too hard, too fast—mistakes get made, people around us become alienated, we spend cash we don’t have and maybe even injure our bodies. A Mars-Saturn opposition is responsible for this and it reaches critical mass next week. Slow your roll.

"
24 may 2017,taurus,"Your passion to live a more interesting and fulfilling life is increasing, Taurus. You can make a lot of progress here as long as you keep it real and avoid airy-fairy thinking. Remember that you alone are responsible for creating a certain lifestyle, education, or mindset for yourself. If you place these things in the hands of others, waiting for them to fulfill your plans or agree with them, you might be waiting for a long time.

"
25 may 2017,taurus,"Get ready for doors to open in your career, Taurus. Today’s new moon falls in your income sector, allowing you to track down a better paying gig or more income streams for your business. More responsibility may come your way which will build your self esteem. However, a strenuous Mars-Saturn opposition warns you to play it safe with any newfound cash. Don’t run up debt assuming that the bucks will be endlessly pouring in. Likewise, double check the terms of any employment or financial agreement. For example, if offered a new job that pays on a commission basis, crunch the numbers before you accept. Stern Saturn wants you to save.

"
26 may 2017,taurus,"With love planet Venus in the most hidden part of your chart, you may be harboring hidden fantasies about someone. Likewise, you might be picturing a house with a white picket fence and two kids in the yard on swings. Or, you’re telling yourself that the problems in a union will miraculously work out. Get real, Taurus. Luckily some positive aspects over the weekend will help you understand your feelings better and enable you to work things out.

"
27 may 2017,taurus,"You may be looking for ways to build a nicer nest egg, and if that’s the case you’re in luck. With profitable Venus in your house of intuition and hidden wisdom, the best way to hunt down bigger bucks is to go within. Meditate, keep a dream journal or tuck yourself away someplace quiet and ponder new ways to earn and save more. New millionaires are being minted every minute. Why not you?

"
28 may 2017,taurus,"Family and friends can be the best source for advice and assistance these days, so be sure to reach out to them. While you’re in a practical mindset thanks to smart Mercury in Taurus, the people closest to you can open your mind to possibilities and solutions that you hadn’t considered before.

"
29 may 2017,taurus,"Mars can act like a double edged sword in whatever house it happens to be in, and right now it’s in your house of earning, spending and saving money. You can either spend with abandon, assuming that the money will be there somehow when the credit card bill comes in, or you can become motivated to earn more and invest. A tough opposition from mature Saturn today strongly suggests that you follow the latter path.

"
30 may 2017,taurus,"Some quiet reflection about where you’re headed with your career is advised thanks to Uranus firing up your subconscious mind. A sudden solution could hit you that could put more money in your pocket, or you may make a fast decision to leave your current job or even change careers. Tomorrow is an excellent day for researching and then strategizing your next move.

"
31 may 2017,taurus,"Say what you mean and mean what you say! This is no time to hold back your opinions or bright ideas as a superb Mercury aspect encourages you to share your thoughts. People will be listening and will take note. This holds true for personal as well as professional endeavors.

"
1 june 2017,taurus,"Sometimes we can feel tossed and turned by the circumstances in our lives: the things that other people do, the state of the economy, the political scene, our own health issues and so on. But today a structured, cathartic trine between Venus and Saturn allows you to feel as though you’re becoming the captain of your own ship. Your emotional state doesn’t have to be gyrating from moment to moment due to outside conditions. Take control.

"
1 june 2016,taurus,"Be careful where you place your trust, Taurus! This affects your wallet more so than your heart, but both need to be considered. On the financial side, a Sun-Neptune square indicates that you could be asked to invest or spend money in some kind of group activity. Whether it’s a summer share at a beach house or a buddy’s new startup company, the aspects are not the best. On the romantic side, you may be demanding security and answers about long-term plans, but a lover may not be completely honest. Bide your time.

"
2 june 2017,taurus,"The two most optimistic orbs in the solar system, Jupiter and the Sun, are in an awesome angle in houses that deal with making more money. Don’t be surprised if some new assignments or clients come your way that could pay off nicely down the road. But before you jump right in, ask yourself if you’re in the right line of work to begin with. If your job doesn’t stir your soul, it may be time for a change. Next week’s full moon is in your house of passive income, so you might want to consider starting a business on the side rather than changing occupations right now.

"
2 june 2016,taurus,"The Moon is in your sign, Taurus, and it’s winking at amorous Neptune. Whether you’re single or attached, this is good news. A long cherished dream may come to fruition, whether it’s finding the right one, having baby or falling even deeper in love. It seems that you have waited a long time for this, maybe too long…and the cosmos is saying that it’s payback time.

"
3 june 2017,taurus,"Your subconscious mind might be as active as a steaming volcano today, Taurus, thanks to a meeting of abrupt Uranus and Venus. This is good news if you’ve been trying to rid yourself of fears, depression or negative emotions that have plagued you for a long time. Should I even use the word “enlightenment”? It’s possible, and it will be swift in happening. But you could also stumble upon a secret that someone’s been keeping (good or bad). If someone close has been treating you poorly, you may decide that you’ve had enough and quickly make a break. This is all part of a healing process, so roll with it.

"
3 june 2016,taurus,"It’s a good day to turn off your phone and take a short sabbatical from the human race, Taurus!  A Grand Cross in the heavens creates a kerfuffle among the people closest to you, primarily your pals and lover. No one will be able to agree on a course of action, and you’ll be caught in the middle. To top it off, finances get thrown into the mix. One minute you want to get married, the next minute the prospect of supporting a family frightens you. A buddy wants to borrow $1000, and you don’t want to lend it to him. Your lover wants more of a commitment, and you’re thinking you want more independence. There’s a strong security vibe running through this, which will intensify at the time of Sunday’s new moon.

"
4 june 2017,taurus,"Your ability to get your point across skyrockets now that megamouth Mars is in your chatty third house! This is the place where we express ourselves, so get ready for some shameless self-promotion. (Just don’t get into everyone’s faces while you’re at it, a possibility with this placement.) The next few weeks are awesome too for brainstorming, holding meetings with like-minded people who share your vision, graphic arts projects, writing, producing videos, and sales and marketing. Getting to know the neighbors and clinking cocktail glasses with the tribe is also favored, so get out there and mingle.

"
6 june 2017,taurus,"Damn, I look good! That will be your mantra over the next few weeks now that glam Venus is in your house of self image. And if you’re not happy with your appearance, physique or attitude it’s the perfect time to make a change. But you’ll still turn heads, babe, even if you think that you need to drop a few pounds.

"
7 june 2017,taurus,"As Friday’s full moon approaches in your net worth sector, you should be going over your financial statements, figuring out how to pay down debt and considering new ways to increase your income and return on investments. Helping matters along in a big way is the fact that shrewd little Mercury enters the other money house, the place that allows you to really get into the nitty gritty details. Create a budget, slash expenses, and work on projects that will bring in more clients or promote your brand.

"
8 june 2017,taurus,"Group endeavors seem to need a bit of adjustment, whether it’s at the office, your family unit, the tribe or a volunteer effort you’re involved in. Whether you like it or not, it’s time to step up and be the team’s cheerleader! Someone’s gotta get this group moving and with optimistic Jupiter in your house of efficiency, you’re the natural choice. This doesn’t mean that you should get saddled with all of the work, however. Motivate and then delegate.

"
9 june 2017,taurus,"From your chart it appears that some serious decisions need to be made in love, as today’s full moon in Sagittarius is a turning point. Serious Saturn is close by, indicating that whatever you do will have significant long term consequences. This could be anything from breaking up to getting engaged. There’s an air of secrecy too, as if you deliberately keep the “news” from reaching the public, at least for awhile. With so many planets in practical houses, you’re going to want guarantees from love, not half-baked promises that aren’t very comforting.

"
10 june 2017,taurus,"Phew. Gigantic Jupiter resumes direct motion in the most productive part of your chart, putting an end to overload at the office or at home, systems that aren’t working and people who may have been unreliable. Any confusion on your part as to which direction you should be heading in, especially in your career, should start to dissipate. Your previously frazzled state may have caused you to overlook details or the smartest and easiest ways to get things done. Now that the dust has settled you can approach tasks from a position of greater clarity—and optimism.

"
11 june 2017,taurus,"Adventure is calling your name, but so is duty. You know: laundry, house cleaning, chauffeuring the kids around, catching up with work at the office. Tuesday is a much better day to tackle chores, so why not take the day off and play?

"
12 june 2017,taurus,"The devil is in the details, Taurus! You may be really optimistic and ready to roll with a plan that floats your boat, but the planets recommend that you slow down and consider all of the moving pieces that will make it a success. If you push either the project or the people involved in it too hard, things could fall apart. Tomorrow is a much better day to get things in order.

"
13 june 2017,taurus,"Today the cosmos brings some mixed vibes. You  are in an excellent position to knock out chores both at home and at work. You  can impress clients and land new assignments. You  know how to create and stick to a budget. Problem is, despite your best efforts, other people around you aren’t much interested in cooperating. Screw ‘em. Carpe diem. Do your best without their help.

"
14 june 2017,taurus,"Laser like focus is needed when considering your big plans, but you’re in luck. Mature, logical Saturn is in the house that deals with research and probing, enabling you to get clear about the path ahead. One word of warning, however: Neptune will be retrograding on Friday in your house of teamwork. People will flake out, drop the ball or play games. It may be better to do your own thing for the rest of the year. There is no “I” in the word “team”? Too freakin’ bad.

"
15 june 2017,taurus,"Stern Saturn tells you to take an in-depth look at your financial situation, Taurus. This is no time to take risks with your income, career or spending. If you’re looking for a new job or income stream, the good news is that your intuition is working overtime to help you find one. Go within and seek answers.

"
16 june 2017,taurus,"The bull is known for being brave and fearless, but over the next few months you need to become more discrete. Neptune begins to backspin in your eleventh house of friends and networking, which includes business contacts. Reveal little and make sure that team members aren’t slacking. Since this sector also governs technology, it’s imperative to think before you hit the “send” button! Avoid rants, slanderous e-mails and trolling. It could come back to bite you in the tuckus.

"
17 june 2017,taurus,"If you feel like an old friend is someone you knew in a past life, there may be something to it! The cosmos is telling you to stick to people who are true blue, the folks you can count on no matter what. Sometimes a small, close knit circle is more rewarding than a bevy of acquaintances.

"
18 june 2017,taurus,"Sometimes half the battle is believing in yourself, even if deep down you have doubts about your abilities or future prospects. Uranus, the planet of genius thinking, is in one heck of a good mood today, urging you to take a chance on you.  Slow and steady will win this race so take it one day at a time.

"
19 june 2017,taurus,"Your long term financial future is in the cosmos’s crosshairs today, so get ready to buckle down and analyze your statements and investments. Pay close attention to what your own inner wisdom advises you rather than the opinions of others who may not have a clue. Tomorrow is a good time to seek the advice of experts.

"
20 june 2017,taurus,"Filters, please! Some of the stuff that goes on in your head should remain there, not to be released to the world. You’re entitled to a private life, something that you may forget over the next few weeks as the Sun enters the chattiest part of your chart. So go ahead and mingle with others, but keep some information to yourself.

"
21 june 2017,taurus,"This is one of your best times all year to get together with other people and toss around ideas, shoot the breeze and enjoy their company. Both the Sun AND chatty Mercury enter your house of self-expression today, setting the stage for socializing and brainstorming. If you express yourself through the arts, this is one heck of a time to produce excellent work.

"
22 june 2017,taurus,"No matter what you do for a living, you need to be able to express yourself well. The same goes for being a good parent, friend or lover. The next four weeks are superb for polishing up your communications skills, the written kind and the verbal. Heck, you may even consider teaching or going on the lecture circuit!

"
23 june 2017,taurus,"Getting your point across should be easy today as the Moon conjuncts chatty Mercury. You’re currently in a very expansive mindset, thinking about possibilities that others around you may not be able to see. Give them some time to catch up to your level.

"
24 june 2017,taurus,"While today’s new moon is falling in your house of local activities—meeting the neighbors, going to parties, signing up for an adult ed class—a happy Venus-Pluto aspect suggests having even more  fun abroad! So if you’ve been thinking about a long distance vacation, or even spending junior year in another country, now’s the time to start researching it.

"
25 june 2017,taurus,"Take a time out from either a project or a problem that you’ve been attempting to wrap up. Aggressive Mars is stirring up your brain to the point where you’re overwhelmed or too caught up in minutiae. If you need to seek advice from a mentor or close confidante, do so: another person’s viewpoint could do the trick.

"
26 june 2017,taurus,"Super schmooze! What a day to work a room and meet new people. Shop your resume, go to a singles get together, attend an industry event, or join a club. Not only will you make new contacts, but some of these people will inspire you in ways that you simply can’t imagine right now.

"
26 june 2016,taurus,"Jupiter has been working double overtime in your romance department since last summer, trying to bring you happiness in love. Today it forms a rare and special angle with Pluto, something that you won’t see again until 2024! Both of these orbs are asking you to reconsider your attitude and values toward romance. It’s time to become more adventurous and take a few risks.

"
27 june 2017,taurus,"With go-getter Mars and the Sun in your third house of thinking and planning you’re in a good spot for making progress in just about any area of your life. Inspirational Neptune will help you (and your team, if you have one) keep your eye on the prize–but you’ll need to check in daily to make sure that you’re on the right track.

"
27 june 2016,taurus,"I love you to the moon and back. Words of love can finally flow as Mercury enters your communications sector and Mars resumes direct motion in your house of committed relationships. Better yet: an amorous trine between the two planets of love takes place today! Venus and Neptune hold a serious convo about the state of your union. Heads up, single people! You’re included. Get out there and mingle.

"
28 june 2017,taurus,"Hands down, this is one of the best days in 2017 for you to express yourself. Mars and Mercury meet in your third house of communication, so start shouting from the mountaintop, my friend. Pitch a client or potential employer, make the big ask, propose marriage, ask someone out on a date or unleash the mother of all social media campaigns.

"
28 june 2016,taurus,"Slow down, babe! The planets are telling you to cool your jets, especially where romance is concerned. It’s not that you’re on the wrong path; it’s more like you want things, and you want them now.  Weddings, babies, commitment, an answer of some kind, whatever it is, you’re ready to move on–and your partner may not be. Single bulls may be in too much of a rush to find someone and settle down. Chill.

"
29 june 2017,taurus,"Feel like you’re talking to a wall? That might be the case with a Mercury-Pluto face off in the heavens. Someone may be hell bent on sticking to their opinion, unwilling to listen to sound advice. This dynamic could happen in a group as well. You’re coming from a smart place thanks to Mercury in your intellectual third house, but that doesn’t mean that others will recognize that your words are wise.

"
29 june 2016,taurus,"You’re more than ready to close out past dramas, be they of a personal or financial manner. The full moon on the 20th was designed to help you rid yourself of toxic ties and worn-out stories that you’ve been telling yourself (not to mention the stories you hear from other people!).  Fortunately, a positive and powerful conjunction between the Moon and Uranus helps you put an end to at least one drama, enabling you to move on to a better place.

"
30 june 2017,taurus,"There seems to be a disconnect between an ambitious plan that needs to get rolling and the actual means of getting it done. However, a snappy Moon-Jupiter connection today will put you in more a can-do attitude. Jupiter is the planet of abundance, so it will enable you to see possibilities instead of limitations.

"
30 june 2016,taurus,"A battle of wills or words could erupt today, as Venus and Pluto stare each other down in the heavens. It’s critical to think before you speak, as Venus is in the most verbal part of your chart. However, even if you have honey dripping from your tongue, someone else may have acid dripping from theirs. It’s possible under current planetary aspects that they’re trying to protect their “turf”, however small and insignificant that might be! Let ’em keep it.

"
1 july 2017,taurus,"Feeling fit and vibrant is a wonderful possibility, thanks to healing and optimistic Jupiter urging you to take better care of yourself. From your chart it appears that this might work better if you take the team approach, so: find an exercise buddy. Take a class at the gym instead of  jogging solo. Search out the expertise of a nutritionist or physical therapist if need be.

"
2 july 2017,taurus,"Watch your tongue, toro! Blabbermouth Mars in your communication sector opposes Pluto, which could make you say the wrong thing at the wrong time to the wrong person. This is no time for making accusations or tossing around half-baked opinions. Say as little as possible, and make sure that whatever you say is objective.

"
2 july 2016,taurus,"Catharsis. That’s what the planets have on offer for you as an extremely helpful angle occurs between the illuminating Sun and rational Saturn. Give a voice to your deepest emotions, even if you just scribble them down in a journal. The new moon on Monday will help you communicate necessary thoughts and emotions to the people in your world over the next few weeks, to your benefit and peace of mind.

"
3 july 2017,taurus,"You may be in the mood for doing things your way, but a happy lunar aspect paves the way for successful partnering or socializing with others. Don’t worry, you won’t get tied down to other peoples’ expectations. With the upcoming full moon in your house of independent action, you’ll have plenty of freedom.

"
3 july 2016,taurus,"Someone from your past may reappear on the scene, Taurus, and they may be interested in rekindling a relationship. Whether you want them back or not is another issue, but with so much positive planetary activity happening in your communication sector, you’ll be able to sort out your thoughts. A misunderstanding with a friend could also be resolved within the next few days.

"
4 july 2017,taurus,"Now that romance planet Venus is in your house of stability you’ll be in no mood for a lover who won’t commit, nor sitting at home alone. It’s a good time to find someone new, a person with maturity and some financial cred. Happily involved? Then it’s time for some posher nights out on the town–no beer and pizza in front of the TV. Live a little!

"
4 july 2016,taurus,"You may be feeling highly emotional these days, as a new moon in your house of thinking and expression is opening up your heart and mind. But there is so much support coming from other planets that this won’t be an unhappy event; on the contrary, it’s quite beneficial. The planet of logical thinking, Saturn, is in a fabulous angle, helping you release old emotions that are no longer serving you.

"
5 july 2017,taurus,"Awesome day to showcase your talent or ideas to a willing audience. It could be your friends, the boss, your family, the news media, you name it–don’t hold back today. Just be aware that they will probably want to know the details, the nitty gritty about how you intend to get things done.

"
5 july 2016,taurus,"If you’ve been considering doing something inspirational—starting or joining a charity, writing a book, helping a friend through a difficult time—this is a wonderful day to get started. Your ability to work with others and speak your truth are powerful, thanks to a happy Mercury-Neptune trine.

"
6 july 2017,taurus,"OK Taurus, it’s time to stop talking  about living a healthy lifestyle and getting in shape, and time to start doing something about it. Abundant, healing Jupiter has been in your house of vitality since last fall and it will leave this October. Don’t let this fabulous opportunity go to waste. Start the diet and exercise regimen, set appointments with physicians and get more sleep. You have a busy time ahead and you need to be in top form.

"
6 july 2016,taurus,"Things could start getting cozier at home with a warm Mars-Venus trine. From cohabitatiing with your amour to shopping for luxe throws and table ware, your home could finally start to feel like your castle. If you’re not happy with your current digs, roommate, or domestic situation, today is perfect for talking things over and finding solutions. Not to mention shopping!

"
7 july 2017,taurus,"You can get your point across today in a practical yet loving manner. This is especially important at home or with a lover, as verbal Mercury is now in your house of domesticity and serenity. If boundaries need to be established, or “roles” (“it’s your job to clean out the litter box, honey”) by all means let people know what you expect.

"
7 july 2016,taurus,"Your words carry weight and you can’t take them back. That is especially true today, as two oppositions and a square in your communication sector warn you to parse your words carefully. Things that you say could carry, meaning that others may read too much into them; they could be endlessly forwarded to others via e-mail; or they could become distorted. The smartest move is to act like a cloistered nun who has taken a vow of silence.

"
8 july 2017,taurus,"Workshops, webinars, classes, lectures, mastermind groups–all of these may be on your agenda as a full moon takes place in the most mind expanding part of your chart. Whether you want to improve your tennis game, become a better parent or learn how to blog, the timing is perfect for seeking out knowledge. The more people you talk to, the more inspired you will become.

"
8 july 2016,taurus,"Considering learning new skills? Then go online and see what’s on offer at the nearest college, trade school or adult ed program. With quick-witted Mercury in your education sector, you’ll be able to pick up new information quickly. Better yet is that profitable Jupiter is in a good angle, suggesting that you could earn more from your efforts.

"
9 july 2017,taurus,"Your desire to learn more is high with planets in the houses that govern the taking in of information. You may feel like a great big sponge, soaking up knowledge, but even a sponge can reach a point where it can’t hold any more water! Give yourself time to absorb (no pun intended) what you’ve already learned before you take on more.

"
9 july 2016,taurus,"Feeling flirty? You should be! The lovestruck Moon meets up with happy Jupiter in your romance sector, jazzing you up for some coquetry. Singles could meet a new flame, the stork may visit and attached bulls could share a tender moment. Hobbies and creative pursuits are also highly favored this weekend.

"
10 july 2017,taurus,"Pick your battles wisely, Taurus. People around you may be critical or pushy, and chances are you may want to strike back. But is it worth it? Only you can decide. Besides, with the recent full moon in the most optimistic part of your chart, you may not really care all that much!

"
10 july 2016,taurus,"If you love someone, let them know and let it show! With the Sun and Mercury in your candid third house, it’s time to let down any walls and start talking long term. Yes, I’m talking to you commitment-phobes, because these orbs are forming magnificent angles to Jupiter in the house of romance and Mars in the partnership area. It’s also a phenomenal day for singles to meet someone new, but honey, you’ve gotta advertise!

"
11 july 2017,taurus,"Your desire to accomplish many tasks is admirable, Taurus, but you may end up overwhelmed and unable to complete them all. Furthermore, from your chart it appears that other people may not be willing to do their fair share, or they’ll oppose your ideas. Create a short list and dig in to it.

"
11 july 2016,taurus,"It may suddenly occur to you today that someone around you is operating with a hidden agenda. Whether it’s a family member, frenemy, lover or colleague, your gut may tell you that everything is not what it appears to be. Should you talk it over? Chances are you won’t get the straight story. This energy continues into the weekend, so stay on your toes.

"
12 july 2017,taurus,"It’s smart to seek the advice of a friend or a seasoned professional before you move ahead. The recent full moon has pushed you to take some calculated risks…but why put yourself out there without gaining the wisdom of people who know what to do next?

"
12 july 2016,taurus,"Start trawling the lifestyle blogs, Taurus, because luxury-loving Venus is now in your domestic sector! If your place could use a facelift now is the time to call in the interior designers, painters and contractors. Venus can push you into posh, or bring out your inner no-frills feng shui. Your home should be your castle. Get thee to the store.

"
13 july 2017,taurus,"With the passionate Moon connecting with amorous neptune, this can be quite a romantic day–and evening! make plans with your honey, and try something new considering that the full moon was in your house of living a more colorful life. Singles, both online dating or an intro from a pal are auspicious for meeting a new flame.

"
13 july 2016,taurus,"Getting in touch with our emotions is not always an easy task, but now that intelligent Mercury is stationed in your fourth house of contentment and security, it should be. Over the next few weeks you should think about what it is that you need to make your life run more smoothly and happily. Then talk things over with the people in your life. With planet of ease Venus in the same part of the sky, you have a wonderful opportunity to create a more serene lifestyle.

"
14 july 2017,taurus,"It’s time for the people around you to start working together as a team, whether it’s your family, friends or work colleagues. And you may have to be the person to get them there. Fortunately silver-tongued Mercury is in a good spot, shaking hands with optimistic Jupiter in your synergy sector. Take action today so that you can relax more next week.

"
14 july 2016,taurus,"How we communicate with the people closest to us is of paramount importance. Today, you may be struck with a positive insight as to how to handle your romantic relationships (current or future) in a much more productive manner. You’re growing as a person, Taurus! Next week’s full moon will expand your mind and put you in a much more philosophical place.

"
15 july 2017,taurus,"This is not a weekend for staying inside, unless that means attending a rager of a party. A happy Moon-Mars trine is telling you to gather the tribe and have a hell of a lot of fun. Besides, you never know whom you might meet (yes single people, I’m talking to you.)

"
15 july 2016,taurus,"We’re all plagued by difficult emotions and memories, but today’s powerful Moon-Saturn conjunction allows you to release them. Now is the moment for a spiritual and emotional cleansing. Saturn will provide you with the tools to replace old negative patterns and replace them with happier ones that will stand the test of time.

"
16 july 2017,taurus,"Your intuition will be running high today courtesy of a Moon-Uranus meet up. A sudden realization may hit you as Uranus is not only the planet of genius, but abrupt change. Don’t divulge any psychic hits that you receive, however, even to people who are close to you. Keep your cards close to your vest.

"
16 july 2016,taurus,"This weekend is all about family and other people in your inner circle, Taurus. The Sun in your demonstrative third house urges you to connect with your loved ones and have a good old-fashioned talk,  which means: no e-mails, texting, or sitting in front of a TV or computer screen. That goes for your tribe as well as you! Trust me, your electronic devices will still be there on Monday.

"
17 july 2017,taurus,"Your own logic and intuition are a far better source of understanding than the opinions of others, so don’t waste too much time listening to them. Furthermore, someone may be working their agenda, which naturally favors them instead of you. Remain vigilant and say little.

"
17 july 2016,taurus,"Wanderlust alert! The Moon moves into the most adventurous part of your chart today, setting your thoughts on vacations, new sports you’d like to try, and even the kind of new people you’d like to meet! When La Luna becomes full on Tuesday in this sector, you may make the decision to start living a little bit more on the edge. And why not? Life’s too short to have regrets.

"
18 july 2017,taurus,"Building better bonds is the name of the game with a fortuitous Venus-Jupiter trine. These are the two “benefics” of the solar system, the planets most willing to ease the path ahead and bring abundance. In your case they’ll help solidify your connections with others, which will lead to a sense of security on your part.

"
18 july 2016,taurus,"There are people in our culture, past and present, whom we deem to be visionaries: Bill Gates, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Maria Montessori. But their ability to see the big picture isn’t a gift, it’s a skill that can be developed. And that’s what the planets are encouraging you to do today: think out of the box, reject small and petty attitudes (in yourself and others), and soar. Tomorrow’s full moon in the most adventurous part of your chart will open up the windows of your mind.

"
19 july 2017,taurus,"This is no time to keep your feelings or opinions to yourself. A positive Mercury aspect encourages you to open up, even if you feel vulnerable in doing so. The long term benefits that you will derive from productive conversations may surprise you, so start talking!

"
19 july 2016,taurus,"Moving out of your comfort zone isn’t always easy, but today’s full moon in the most expansive part of your chart will do wonders to boost your resolve. A positive angle between talkative Mercury and serious Saturn suggests that you have a heart to heart talk with a friend, family member, lover or trusted confidante about your innermost thoughts, the kind that might be holding you back. Fear, worry, lack of confidence…banish them. When the Sun moves into Leo this Friday your faith in yourself will only increase.

"
20 july 2017,taurus,"Family and housing matters start to heat up now that Mars is in this part of your chart. Mars is like a two-edged sword: it can stir up way too much drama, or cut problems quickly so that you can make real progress. The choice is yours.

"
20 july 2016,taurus,"You’re a grounded person by nature, Taurus, and current planetary influences are trying to bring more peace and stability to your home base. A marvelous Venus-Saturn trine allows you to smooth over family or residential dramas so that you can move on to greater contentment. You may be the one extending the olive branch and playing the role of consigliere, but isn’t greater serenity worth it?

"
21 july 2017,taurus,"Snark alert! Someone seems bound and determined to play games with you today, knowing just what to say to push you over the edge. Whether it’s an all-out assault or a passive-aggressive technique, you have a choice here: to react and respond, or just to let it go.

"
21 july 2016,taurus,"In order to reach the top you’re going to have to change your methods somewhat. Having goals and a game plan aren’t enough under current planetary influences. Just how creative is your process? Doing things the same old way will produce the same old results.

"
22 july 2017,taurus,"It’s been a bumpy few weeks with people acting up, perhaps trying to throw you off your game, but now that the Sun is in Leo they won’t succeed. This is your fourth house of comfort and security, the place where we reach an inner peace that others can’t mess with.

"
22 july 2016,taurus,"Now that the Sun is in Leo, you’ll be focused on living a fuller life with more contentment and ease. Start with your home base. Is it a chaotic mess? Are family members sullen, or at each other’s throats? Do the furnishings reflect who you really are? If not, it’s time to bring beauty, comfort and peace back into your life, whatever it takes.

"
23 july 2017,taurus,"A happier period in your home life begins with a new moon in Leo. That is, if you’re willing to accept happiness! The issue is that erratic Uranus is acting up in the subconscious mind sector, stirring up past grudges and dramas that may have occurred with a lover or family member. Want peace? Then let it go.

"
23 july 2016,taurus,"It’s tribe time. With the Moon in your friendship sector forming a terrific angle with Neptune, you can not only enjoy the company of friends, but comfort as well. Get things off your chest with the people who understand you the best. With the Sun now in your domestic sector, a quiet evening at home with pals is in the stars.

"
24 july 2017,taurus,"Don’t be so hard on yourself, Taurus! A Venus-Saturn opposition indicates that you’re being way too self critical at a time when you should be healing your psyche and pampering yourself. Drop some of the rules and regulations that you’ve imposed on your life.

"
24 july 2016,taurus,"In Taoism, the “empty mind” is prized, which essentially means a mind free of worry and anxiety. A nurturing Moon-Sun angle helps shed light on the parts of your psyche that are causing unrest. Contentment can  by yours; empty out the “trash” in your subconscious first!

"
25 july 2017,taurus,"Hey there, foxy. Mercury has just entered your romance sector, enabling you to get flirty–and maybe a little bit dirty! Seriously, you can charm just about anyone these days, so use this suave and creative energy to make connections with people in all walks of life.

"
25 july 2016,taurus,"Risky business! Pluto is currently in the most adventurous part of your chart, pushing you out of your comfort zone into a bolder place. So why are you holding back? The emotional Moon in your house of the subconscious mind is dredging up fears and concerns. Slow down and relax. When the Moon enters Taurus tomorrow clarity will return.

"
26 july 2017,taurus,"Fabulous day for creating emotional security, whatever that means to you: getting engaged, settling a family quarrel, starting a mindfulness or gratitude practice, finding out that someone loves you back. You may need to take the lead but the results will be worth it.

"
26 july 2016,taurus,"With the Moon in your sign forming a happy trine with Pluto, you may feel compelled to stretch a bit out of your comfort zone. And why not? Life is too short to do things the same old way. Travel, study, appreciating art and other cultures-these are the best ways to grow right now.

"
27 july 2017,taurus,"When it comes to the nuts and bolts of our daily lives, we can either be way behind on our chores, barely caught up with them or–better yet–nicely ahead. Now that the Moon is in your efficiency sector, why not try to hustle and blast though your list? Greater serenity lies ahead, a sweet bonus.

"
27 july 2016,taurus,"You’ve been experiencing some intense emotions as of late, but today provides you with a welcome–even surprising–patch of peace of mind. Not only that, you’re ready to nurture your mind with positive treatment, such as going for a walk in nature, or meditating, rather than the usual stuff–junk food, a few drinks, trawling the web. Keep up the healing energy.

"
28 july 2017,taurus,"Somehow the trolls and the malcontents won’t annoy you as much today–could be due to optimistic Jupiter in a good position! Yup, you’re just going to charge forward with your day’s activities, humming a happy tune. Contentment is something you can get used to!

"
29 july 2017,taurus,"Your body language can say just as much about you as your words, so if you want to control your “message” be aware of both. Don’t give away too much information via subtle clues hidden in your gestures or facial expressions.

"
29 july 2016,taurus,"Uranus starts its annual backstroke session through the house of your subconscious mind, creating ripples in its wake. This is the planet of genius and rebellion, but it can be erratic. Pay close attention to your gut hunches and dreams as they can be downright psychic. But before you act upon a hunch, use logic and rational thought to guide your actions.

"
30 july 2017,taurus,"Security can actually be sexy! Singles, keep your mind open to the “quiet” types–there could be a lot more steamy stuff going on beneath the surface. And for those of you already attached, this is a good day for spending some secluded hours with each other.

"
30 july 2016,taurus,"What do you want out of a romance? With whip-smart Mercury heading into your love sector, you’ll be able to elucidate your needs without delusion. True, deceptive Neptune is in your house of big dreams, but if you’ve been kidding yourself about a partner, Mercury will clear the fog. The next few weeks are excellent for talking things over with your amour, and kids as well.

"
31 july 2017,taurus,"Your sign likes feeling grounded, and now that Venus is in Cancer you should be able to develop more stability, especially on the home and romantic fronts. You may have to take the lead when it comes to initiating conversations with loved ones, but the end result–greater contentment–will be worth it.

"
31 july 2016,taurus,"We all have big plans and dreams, but today you’re advised to keep them under wraps. Verbalizing them could stir up resistance from the people closest to you, who may not be on board with your ideas–yet. The good news is that Neptune, the planet of inspiration, is in a good angle, indicating that your goals are coming from a pure place.

"
1 august 2017,taurus,"The opportunity to make more money is on the table, and the best way to go about it is to be as amiable as possible with people who can help you. Pull people onto your team and strategize as a group rather than going this alone. Aggression or fast starts won’t work: take your time and make wise decisions.

"
1 august 2016,taurus,"With Venus and the Sun so active in your family sector, it would be wise to set aside some quality time to spend with loved ones–or just yourself. Recharge your batteries by cocooning with a good book and a glass of wine. And while you’re at it, take a look around–is there a room that could use some redecorating? Tomorrow’s new moon is going to make you a lot more interested in turning your home into a castle.

"
2 august 2017,taurus,"Long term financial and romantic plans are under a microscope today, but that’s a good thing! You’ll be able to assess the direction you should be heading in, which is important as next week’s lunar eclipse falls in your house of big dreams and goals.

"
2 august 2016,taurus,"Ggrrrr! Hey there, tiger.  Mars enters your house of intimacy and libido for a nice long, sultry stay. With a new moon occurring at the same time in your cocooning-at-home sector, chances are you’ll be more interested in cuddling chez vous  rather than hitting the scene. So while PDAs may not be on the menu, watch out for dramas behind closed doors. Mars can stir up jealousy and mistrust: mix logic with your lust.

"
3 august 2017,taurus,"Say “adios” to problematic people and situations. Brilliant Uranus is now retrograding through your house of closure and transition, pointing out the areas of your life that needs to be revised. Between now and early January you will be cutting a lot of unnecessary cords. Buh-bye!

"
3 august 2016,taurus,"Impulsive Uranus may be making you anxious to resolve a family or romantic situation, and indeed the aspects for doing so are excellent. But while you want to get things out in the open, don’t push others too hard to make a decision, especially about long-term plans. They’ll come around over the next few weeks. Give them time.

"
4 august 2017,taurus,"Power struggles could erupt at the office with people trying to grab credit, gain control or push a project ahead faster than it should move. At the same time others may be nitpicking and dragging their feet. With next week’s full moon occurring in your house of ambition and success, you’ll have no trouble getting this situation back in line.

"
4 august 2016,taurus,"Someone’s going to be feeling flirty and amorous over the next few weeks, and it’s the sign of the bull. But you have to be careful who the target of your attention is. Under the current planetary aspects, even the most innocent remark could be misconstrued by someone. Think before your speak…or wink.

"
5 august 2017,taurus,"A friend may be in need of comfort and assurances that things will work out, and you may be the light to guide them. With the Sun in Leo, you’ll be able to strike just the right note of compassion and authority.

"
5 august 2016,taurus,"While Venus enters your house of romance today for a three-week visit, you’re being warned by the cosmos to think not only with your heart, but with your head. The issue is that your passions may rise to the point where you’re guided more by lust or fantasy than common sense. And just because your friends may all be coupled up doesn’t mean that you should rush into a relationship. Take your time, Taurus.

"
6 august 2017,taurus,"Bright ideas may be bubbling through your mind….but how the heck to execute them? With the passionate Moon boxed in by other orbs, the answer may not be clear today. But it will be by the time of Monday’s lunar eclipse.

"
6 august 2016,taurus,"Got something to say to your sweetheart? Can it wait? Because this weekend has some tense vibes, especially when it comes to holding serious discussions. Your best bet is to keep it light: take in a movie, make a date a group event with close friends invited along, or head to the beach for some fun in the sun. Hold off on convos til next Wednesday, a far more opportune time to chat.

"
7 august 2017,taurus,"Yasss!! A lunar eclipse in your goals sector could bring a deeply held wish to a stunning conclusion, if not this week then over the next six months. This is especially true in both your career, family and fitness plans. The good thing is that you may finally be able to balance the demands of a busy job with your personal life, so make this a priority.

"
7 august 2016,taurus,"We live in an Instagram world in which so often it appears that everyone else is living the good life. Fear of missing out could lead us to covet things or people that may not be the best for us, however. A tense opposition today between Mercury and Neptune could make you pine for a fantasy life that really wouldn’t make you happy, even if it did come true. Keep it real and count your blessings.

"
8 august 2017,taurus,"The eclipse yesterday in your goals and career sector has opened up an auspicious six-month period in which you can make enormous progress. Today a hush-hush Moon-Uranus aspect suggests that you tuck yourself away for a quiet strategy session. A bright idea may appear out of the blue–pay attention to it!

"
8 august 2016,taurus,"How well you work as a member of a team is in the planets’ crosshairs today, Taurus! Yes, you may have dealt with troublesome co-workers and romantic partners in the past, but in order to  move forward you’ll need to switch up the way you view them. This isn’t some kind of “kumbayah/everyone is beautiful/surround yourself with white light” nonsense, but a practical approach. Let their s*** be their s*** as you go about your day.

"
9 august 2017,taurus,"You may be tempted to take a risk with powerful Pluto encouraging you to push up against previous boundaries. Fortunately, the Sun links with Pluto in such a way that you can consider making changes intelligently without a lot of undue risk.

"
9 august 2016,taurus,"You’re getting tired of living a life that feels hemmed in by budget constraints and old dramas. Fortunately, the cosmos is serving up a delicious trine tomorrow, but you should start to feel its energy today. The idea of taking a chance in love or business is becoming less of a fantasy and looking like more of a reality. When Saturn goes direct this weekend, the resources you need to make progress will start to manifest.

"
10 august 2017,taurus,"You’ll be highly motivated to get things on an even keel with everyone in your world: kids, family, co-workers and your lover. With lovely, gentle Venus in your house of communication, you’ll be able to catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. No need for drama or ultimatums.

"
10 august 2016,taurus,"If you want a project to move ahead, you’re in an excellent position to persuade someone. Expansive Mercury in the most creative part of your chart will help you paint the right kind of imagery with your words. This energy will last for several days so take advantage of it. Partnerships and alliances are especially favored.

"
11 august 2017,taurus,"Careful, El Toro! Mercury begins to retrograde manana in your romance sector through the 31st. A harsh opposition to Neptune demands that you find out for sure whether a lover is on the same page as you when it comes to long term plans, and that includes those of you who are single and looking. Don’t sell out just to have a Saturday night date.

"
11 august 2016,taurus,"You may conflicted about a course of action, Taurus. Assertive Mars is telling you to go for it while stern Saturn is warning you to step on the brakes. Adding fuel to this fire is the emotional Moon gliding past both of these orbs in the heavens today. Wait until the weekend, at which time Saturn goes direct. The answers may not come quickly but there will be more clarity for you.

"
12 august 2017,taurus,"Despite the fact that Mercury has just retrograded in your romance sector, this weekend is quite amorous with a Venus-Neptune trine. This is an excellent time to work things out with calm, sensible discussions, not to mention enjoying dinner in a cozy cafe. Singles definitely should attend parties or events where people gather as this is an auspicious time for meeting someone new.

"
12 august 2016,taurus,"Trust your gut when it comes to vetting the people around you, as the planets are casting a stern eye toward lovers and friends. It’s possible that you just need to take a little alone time away from the tribe to get in touch with your emotions and relax a bit. But if a relationship with someone has become more trouble than it’s worth, it may be time to move on.

"
13 august 2017,taurus,"This is no time to hide in the shadows when it comes to love or family matters! On the contrary. A Sun-Saturn trine bodes well for creating structure and figuring out what lies ahead: a pregnancy, getting engaged or helping your parents out.

"
13 august 2016,taurus,"The clouds part as Saturn resumes direct motion in one of the most emotional areas of your chart. The past five months may have been onerous as you questioned a romantic relationship, or were beset by financial burdens. Court awards, child support, commission monies and inheritances may have been stalled. Hallelujah, the ringed planet starts to pull you out of this funk. Serious decisions about where you’re headed, both in love and business, can now be made.

"
14 august 2017,taurus,"With the passionate Moon in your sign, you’re willing to speak up about the way you feel, especially when it comes to showing affection! Don’t hide your love for your family, kids, lover or even your pets. It’s also an auspicious time for showcasing your ideas at the office, as profitable Venus has your back.

"
14 august 2016,taurus,"Having fun is definitely on the planets’ agenda for you, as three planets–Mercury, Venus and Jupiter–are all parked in your house of entertainment, love, sports and culture. But relationships with friends could get a bit dicey today and into early next week as watery Neptune swirls its mist. If you need to take a little time out, do so. You don’t want to be influenced by their opinions right now, even if they have your own best interests at heart. Be your own judge.

"
15 august 2017,taurus,"The critics are out today in full force, so don’t fall prey to worrying about what others say to you. And make sure that you’re not doling out opinions that someone else won’t appreciate. The air clears on Friday.

"
15 august 2016,taurus,"Take a chance on a creative new idea or plan! The passionate Moon conjuncts Pluto, the great transformer. They’ll boost your optimism and desire to go for something that you haven’t tried before. With Mercury in a terrific angle from your cutting-edge thinking sector, your ideas will be way ahead of the crowd.

"
16 august 2017,taurus,"Pay more attention to what a lover or family member has to say than a friend, Taurus. Likewise, start focusing more on your family than your pals. Murky Neptune in your friendship sector warns that not all of your “buddies” have your back.

"
16 august 2016,taurus,"It’s nice to have a lovely looking home, but a gorgeous interior setting that looks like it came from a design magazine isn’t worth it if you’re not truly enjoying the space. Home is more than a place to sleep and eat–it can be your workshop. Start setting aside more time for cooking, gardening, sewing, woodwork; whatever kind of hobby that fills you up with contentment and makes you smile.

"
17 august 2016,taurus,"Take the time to have a heartfelt talk with someone today, as it will only strengthen your relationship. A beautiful Venus-Pluto trine enables walls to come down and a true exchange of opinions and emotions. In matters of the heart, you and a lover may now be able to plan the next big step.

"
18 august 2017,taurus,"You can get your point across today with passion, so speak out! Whether you’re trying to make a major sales presentation or work things out with a lover, the lines of communication are definitely open. Tomorrow is a better time for reflection, so don’t waste today’s energy.

"
18 august 2016,taurus,"Take a bow, Taurus. Today’s full moon falls in your house of achievement and success. Something that you’ve been working on may finally come to a fabulous close. But even if you haven’t been pushing hard to reach new goals, this lunation will give you the drive to go after them. When the Sun enters Virgo next week your creative mojo will soar, so take advantage of the good energy on offer.

"
19 august 2017,taurus,"Be guarded with your opinions and words as erratic Uranus could prompt you to say things that need to be kept below the radar for now. Just because you think it doesn’t mean that you should say it. Wait until Sunday if you need to get something out in the open.

"
19 august 2016,taurus,"You’re coming into your own, Taurus. Yesterday’s full moon is pushing you to seize the reins in life rather than letting others call the shots. You may be tested today by someone who is determined to maintain their “power position”, but hold your ground. With Neptune prominent, you don’t need to be aggressive or loud–silence rules. Let the other person figure it out for themselves.

"
20 august 2016,taurus,"With so much planetary energy taking place in your fifth house of fun, creativity and romance, this is a perfect weekend to get outside and enjoy what’s on offer: street fairs, the park, a bike ride, art galleries, or a tucked-away little cafe. And don’t feel guilty about it either! Others may be making demands on your time, but you need some down time for yourself.

"
21 august 2016,taurus,"The planets are encouraging you to seek emotional balance. Issues such as mistrust, fear, jealousy, resentment or even obsession need to be moderated or subdued with a healthy dose of logical thinking. Today a positive trine between the Moon, Mars and Saturn sets you on the right path to serenity and a more objective viewpoint. This energy will build as the week progresses, with Wednesday being a breakthrough day.

"
22 august 2016,taurus,"A sizzling set of aspects puts you in the driver’s seat for an enjoyable month ahead, Taurus! First, the Sun moves into Virgo today, your fifth house of fun and romance. It joins three other planets, so the message from the cosmos is loud and clear: carpe diem, baby! Clear the deck of extraneous duties or obligations and seek more love and excitement in your life. Intelligent Mercury also meets up with Jupiter in the same part of the sky, allowing your creative juices to flow.

"
23 august 2016,taurus,"Whom you connect with on a regular basis is under review by the cosmos, Taurus. A wonky aspect tomorrow between Mars and Saturn simultaneously urges you to move forward with an alliance, yet slam on the brakes. Take some time out to analyze your feelings about another person, whether it’s a lover, friend or business partner. If emotions such as anger or resentment bubble to the surface, ask yourself why you feel this way–and then determine to fix the problem.

"
24 august 2016,taurus,"“Don’t be so emo!” may be a phrase that gets tossed around a lot, but getting in touch with your emotions is important today. Both Mars and Saturn are in your house of psychological depth and intimacy, forcing you to examine the feelings that lie deep beneath the surface. Hot-blooded Mars may make you anxious to move forward in a romance (lust! sex!), but cautious Saturn warns you to slow down. Even if the issue at hand is not about love, getting to the bottom of things that have been bothering you is critical if you’re going to move forward.

"
25 august 2016,taurus,"A super conjunction yesterday between Mars and Saturn can help take your financial portfolio to a much higher level, but first you may need to tighten your belt. The emotional Moon in your house of income and spending is urging you to be realistic as to what your dreams will cost, whether it’s a house, retirement, or adding to your family. Joint finances can be a sticky wicket today–make sure you’re on the same page when it comes to fiscal choices.

"
27 august 2016,taurus,"One of the luckiest days all year for love! Bulls are blessed by the cosmos as love planet Venus meets up with abundant Jupiter today in your house of romance. New flames could be kindled while existing ones burn ever brighter. Since this is also the sector that governs children, a baby could be conceived, in addition to simply having an awesome day with the little ones. If love has been elusive, know that a solar eclipse is scheduled to take place in this part of the sky on September 1st.

"
28 august 2016,taurus,"With so many planets piled into your house of fun and socializing, you must  make plans with others and enjoy the planetary energy on offer. But a square between the Moon and Uranus could create mixed lines of communication between you and someone close. With the Moon in your candid third house you may be tempted to blurt out your thoughts. Think before your speak, which includes posting online.

"
29 august 2016,taurus,"Romantic relationships are going to be all over the map this week. A happy Mercury-Venus convo today is super for discussing where things are going and expressing your feelings. But tomorrow Mercury goes retro in this part of your chart, stirring up past issues, and then there’s a solar eclipse on Thursday here too. Put on your seatbelt.

"
30 august 2016,taurus,"You’ve heard about “revenge bodies”, right?  It’s when someone gets into awesome shape just to make their ex miserable. Well, Taurus, it’s your turn for some sweet revenge. Gorgeous Venus just entered your house of fitness, helping you create a masterpiece of fitness and vitality out of your body. And what do you know, Mercury retrogrades in your romance house, possibly bringing an ex back into your life. This is also a good time to work on creative projects and get them ready for showtime.

"
31 august 2016,taurus,"A quirky mix of planetary aspects may find you questioning the state of a romantic liaison. Should you stay or should you go? If you’re happy in love, are you ready for the next step that your partner is expecting? Should you speak up about issues or keep them to yourself for now? Things will become clearer at the time of tomorrow’s eclipse.

"
1 september 2016,taurus,"Your creative mojo goes off the charts with today’s solar eclipse in the most inventive part of your chart. Get ready to impress others with your skills and talent, although with Neptune in a cranky spot, there may be a few haters out there. But what do you care? This lunation can also bring in new love or take an existing relationship to the next step, and quickly at that.

"
2 september 2016,taurus,"With chatty and candid Mercury winking at optimistic and happy-go-lucky Jupiter in your house of love, it will be hard to hold back your feelings! So if you’re lusting after a married co-worker, you better put a filter on that mouth of yours. But if you want to tell a viable prospect or current amour how much you love them, this is a banner day to do so.

"
3 september 2016,taurus,"Yum! Clear your schedule for fun, sports, cultural events and romance as the Moon swings past Venus and Jupiter in your frisky fifth house. The laundry can wait, along with cleaning the toilets and dealing with cranky relatives. Get outside, call some friends, and plan a juicy weekend.

"
4 september 2016,taurus,"It’s a holiday weekend in the US, but you may be so tuckered out from the stress at the office and just trying to keep up with your errands that you can’t see the big picture: the happier, more adventurous side of life. Don’t worry. Generous Jupiter is just about ready to enter your house of efficiency this Friday, helping you come up with tricks and hacks that will enable you to get more done in less time, resulting in greater serenity.

"
5 september 2016,taurus,"Burning the candle at both ends? Then it’s time for a reality check! A strong moon-Uranus opposition suggests that you’ve been taking on too much at the office as well as at home. Planetary influences are firing you up to get organized and become more efficient, but there’s only so much you can accomplish in a day. Slow down, take better care of your health and create a more realistic timetable for getting things done.

"
6 september 2016,taurus,"You’re about to enter a highly effective time period in which you’ll be able to cut through tasks like a hot knife through butter. Jupiter’s entry on Friday into your orderly, practical sixth house will help transform your life into a less stressed experience. But you won’t be doing this alone. With the Moon currently in your partnership sector and the Sun in your house of romance, it would be wise to involve the other people in your circle in your strategy to live a more streamlined, simplified life.

"
7 september 2016,taurus,"Work and leisure are both calling your name, Taurus, as a bevy of planets are in a helpful mood. Venus encourages you to streamline your daily routine, as it will help put more money in the bank. Whether you become a savvier shopper for your family or your efficiency dazzles the boss, it’s all good. And a happy Sun-Pluto connection wants you to balance your daily grind with a big helping of fun, relaxation, travel and culture. Nice!

"
8 september 2016,taurus,"This could be an emotional day as the Moon stirs up old feelings and emotions in one of the most sensitive parts of your chart. However, this is beneficial as it will help you release things that should have been tossed quite some time ago. A happy side effect is that your vitality and health should get a boost, thanks to Venus in your house of glowing health.

"
9 september 2016,taurus,"As precise as a Swiss clock! That’s going to be you  this year, Taurus, thanks to powerful Jupiter entering your house of efficiency and streamlining for the first time since 2005. From your house to the office, you will be on top of chores and impressing bosses and clients with your can-do attitude. This is also an amazing year to get fit and banish chronic aches and pains that have been plaguing you. Just watch the tendency to go overboard with a new fitness regimen, as Jupiter can make us a tad over-optimistic.

"
10 september 2016,taurus,"Your deepest thoughts and emotions should stay in the depths today, Taurus! A strong Saturn-Neptune square advises against sharing confidential thoughts with a person who will make them go viral in your circle. Be cautious when dealing with other members of a team or group you’re associated with, as they may not be trustworthy. Making big plans with a mate? Ensure that they’re on the same page as you, and not just telling you what they think you want to hear.

"
11 september 2016,taurus,"Time for a little assessment. A square between Venus and Pluto indicates that you need to take a time out: in romance, work, health, or other big plans for the future. Sometimes we’re so busy trekking along on our path that we don’t stop to determine just how our progress is going. Being busy doesn’t mean that you’re progressing. Take a few minutes to check.

"
12 september 2016,taurus,"Take what you hear with a grain of salt, Taurus. A Venus-Pluto aspect indicates that someone could be trying to butter you up. This vibe continues into the week, so don’t let up your guard. Likewise, someone may not be expressing their true feelings. This energy changes by Saturday, a much better time for getting down to the truth.

"
13 september 2016,taurus,"Planetary influences this week may find you torn between following your own instincts or those of the herd. Lovers, friends, family members, team mates–they could all be putting in their two cents’ worth. In the meantime, Mars is stirring up your own deep thoughts about matters, which may be quite different than those of your circle. To thine own self be true.

"
15 september 2016,taurus,"That’s what friends are for! That old saying is on point today as a number of planets are encouraging you to reach out to a trusted pal or confidante. If you need to get something off your chest, or want to get the opinion of someone you trust, do so. Don’t go it alone.

"
16 september 2016,taurus,"Between now and February, the people in your orbit will play big part in your future happiness and success. That’s due to the lunar eclipse occurring in your eleventh house of teamwork, friends and camaraderie. You may decide to cut ties with people whose loyalty you question, but exciting new friendships can be made. This is also the house of technology, so online ventures, such as launching a website or an app, ought to take off like a rocket.

"
17 september 2016,taurus,"Hmmm. Mars in your house of sexuality is forming an amazing link to spontaneous Uranus in the house of seclusion! Do I see bodice-ripping sex in your boudoir? That’s a possibility, along with mega-flirtation in public, sexting away on your smart phone, and lusting after that hottie who’s caught your eye. My, my Taurus, what a steamy day you have!

"
18 september 2016,taurus,"You may experience an “aha!” moment (or hear a juicy secret) when it comes to the people you deal with on a daily basis, such as work colleagues or someone at the gym or in the car pool. It could hit you like a tornado, but the smart Taurus keeps their mouth shut. A tough opposition between Venus and Uranus warns to let sleeping dogs lie.

"
19 september 2016,taurus,"Healthy is sexy. Healthy is also confident, which makes you even more charismatic! A super angle today between Venus and Mars will encourage you to improve your vitality. Do it for yourself, your lover (or a future one), and your family.

"
20 september 2016,taurus,"Pluto in the most expansive part of your chart is changing your philosophy of life in a big way. The good news is that you’re developing a bigger and broader view: of love, family life, career, travel and overall lifestyle. Today and Friday Mercury forms a glorious trine with Pluto, adding a dash of creativity to your plans. This entire week is wonderful for brainstorming and day dreaming.

"
22 september 2016,taurus,"A lean, mean machine. That’s what you’re going to become, Taurus, not only with your physique but also at home and work. That’s because the Sun has just entered your sixth house of fitness, health, organizing and streamlining. Helpful Jupiter just went there on the 9th, so with two power players like this in da house, you can’t go wrong. You’ll be beyond  motivated.

"
23 september 2016,taurus,"People around you may be over-optimistic about what can be achieved in a certain amount of time.  Whether it’s your kids, spouse, boss, personal trainer or co-workers, you may need to be the voice of reason today. It may take until next week for them to realize that you’re right! Better late than never.

"
24 september 2016,taurus,"A helpful aspect between Mercury and Pluto will allow you to hold meaningful, productive conversations with your kids or a lover.  From your chart it appears that you need to take control of a situation that has long-term ramifications. Just watch out for coming on too strong or being way too emotional, a possibility with the Moon opposing Pluto.

"
25 september 2016,taurus,"You’re quite focused on a project or course of action, and your determination will only grow in the weeks and months ahead. You’re thinking more long-term and may be reconsidering your path: the best way to move forward on it. With assertive Mars entering Capricorn on Tuesday, others may deem your ideas too lofty or unachievable. Prove them wrong!

"
26 september 2016,taurus,"A superb Sun-Jupiter meeting could bring you the career advancement you’ve been looking for. It could come in the form of a job offer, but there are other ways to become successful: hiring the right staff, employing new technology that makes you more efficient, or streamlining your operations. Your vitality can also soar as a new chapter opens, helping you heal past maladies while you get toned.

"
27 september 2016,taurus,"It’s all systems go as Mars powers its way into your house of adventure, travel, and study. Pluto just went direct here yesterday, so any roadblocks that were holding up big plans should be removed. Sometimes the “roadblocks” are in our minds, and Pluto’s retro spin was designed to have you analyze the areas where you might have been fearful or unsure of yourself. Now Mars will provide you with the ambition to get things done.

"
28 september 2016,taurus,"It’s important to ensure that you and a romantic partner are on the same page, especially when it comes to long-term goals and values. From the current planetary lineup it appears that you may be racing far ahead of your amour—and they may be telling you what they think you want to hear.  Singles could also be too anxious to land a lover and turn them into a spouse. Slow down!

"
29 september 2016,taurus,"A sudden realization may hit you about a romantic situation that needs to be addressed. The Moon is in your vibey twelfth house, helping you assess your life with wisdom that comes from other realms. Even if you’re single you may come to a quick decision about what you want from a future partner. Parents could also intuit what’s going in their kids’ heads, especially helpful if you have teenagers!

"
30 september 2016,taurus,"A lucky meeting between Jupiter and the Moon raises your prospects at the office, so don’t be shy today about promoting your talents. Stay-at-home moms and dads can also benefit from this energy as it can help you land a better babysitter, find play dates for your kids, make your food shopping easier or just streamline your chores.

"
1 october 2016,taurus,"Over the next few months you can make awesome progress at work or at home, dazzling others with your efficiency. A new moon in your productive sixth house sets the stage for a new era of organization and streamlining. If you live with a romantic partner, a pleasant Venus-Neptune trine will help you divide up your household chores in an equitable manner. In business you may discover that taking on a partner or an agent to represent you is the best way to get through your daily grind, as it will free up time and much-needed energy.

"
2 october 2016,taurus,"Life is too short to waste on people and situations that don’t support you. Maybe you feel duty bound to remain in these relationships, or that some kind of crazy karma is at work. But that’s not the case. Pluto asks you to consider whether these factors are holding you back in any way, and if that’s the case, it’s time to move on.

"
3 october 2016,taurus,"If you’re trying to figure out what makes another person tick, today’s planetary aspects could provide some insight. Nurturing Venus forms a positive angle to subterranean Pluto, the planet that points out the inner workings of someone’s mind. This doesn’t mean that you’ll like what you see, but at least you can gain some understanding.

"
4 october 2016,taurus,"You’re in an excellent position to make big strides in creating more wealth today, courtesy of a Sun-Saturn trine. Whether you start your own business, invest in someone else’s, start an IRA, go after your ex for past due child support, refinance your mortgage, patent an invention or consider a joint venture with someone, Saturn has your back. The Sun points out the possibilities; Saturn helps you think logically and long term.

"
5 october 2016,taurus,"You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar, the old saying goes, and truer words were never spoken! With magnetic Venus in your house of partners it will be far easier to convince a lover or business connection that your opinions or needs are worthwhile and should be considered. A more adventurous, free-thinking approach is the way to go.

"
6 october 2016,taurus,"The cosmos is creating a “tortoise and the hare” situation today, with energetic Mars squaring Jupiter. You risk the danger of being so anxious to complete a task that you overlook, fudge or worse—screw up—key details. Don’t go there. Slow and steady is going to win this race, something that you need to keep in mind through the 16th of the month.

"
7 october 2016,taurus,"Resist the urge to control every aspect of your life and those of the people in your environment, which includes co-workers. The fiery Sun is in your house of efficiency, and an angle today with Pluto could encourage you to come down hard on people whom you feel are not pulling their weight. Mercury enters this part of the sky today, making you even more determined to get things done. Since this is the planet of intelligence and fast thinking, your productivity will only increase; don’t worry about what others are (not) doing.

"
8 october 2016,taurus,"Feeling adventurous? You should be, considering that the Moon meets up with energetic Mars today in your risk-taking ninth house. Don’t be surprised if a pal suggests doing something that’s not typical, such as flying off to the Galapagos Islands or doing some cave diving. Teaming up with others for any reason is wise right now, such as charity work or networking at an industry event to make new contacts. Get out there and mingle.

"
9 october 2016,taurus,"Are you afraid to take a risk? The current planetary lineup indicates that you may be holding back when it comes to pursuing an ambition. You’re in an incredible expansive place right now, with many possibilities on offer–even if it doesn’t feel that way. Pull off the blinders and take a chance.

"
10 october 2016,taurus,"Your brain strikes the right balance between short-term planning and focusing on the big picture too with a productive Moon-Mercury-Jupiter connection. Happy Jupiter should make you feel optimistic about your plans, and intelligent Mercury will help keep it real.

"
11 october 2016,taurus,"Efficiency is key, Taurus. You’ll be inspired to be at the top of your game, both at home and at work, with Mercury and Jupiter holding a meeting today in your productivity sector. But this isn’t just about finding quicker ways to plod through chores. Hell no, you’re going to consider big possibilities for the year ahead and strategize how to attain them.

"
12 october 2016,taurus,"Thinking about going into the office today, guns a blazin’? No matter how brilliant your ideas may be, no matter how polished a presentation you possess, it would be wise to tone down your approach. The issue at hand is that smarty pants Mars in your house of opinions may make you come across a wee bit…smug. Or maybe just too intelligent and organized for your co-workers.

"
13 october 2016,taurus,"Details, details. You need focus on them, Taurus, like it or not. It’s fine to have grand ambitions, plans and lists but if you’re in too much of a rush to make the finish line you might overlook some key points. Mars and Pluto are firing up your ambition to break out of ruts and put through changes, which is all good. But the Sun and Jupiter demand a keen eye on the smaller stuff.

"
14 october 2016,taurus,"Excellent day for making long term plans that will build a bigger nest egg. This covers a lot of ground: talking to an investment adviser, accountant or attorney; going after bigger clients with deeper pockets; looking for a higher-paying job; or adding products and services to your company’s lineup with greater potential for profit. Sunday’s full moon, though, falls in your house of confidentiality. Keep things quiet for now.

"
15 october 2016,taurus,"No matter how carefully you’ve made plans, no matter how meticulous you’ve been in your work or errands, today a monkey wrench could get thrown into things. It could be a person trying to pull rank or boss you around; or someone wreaking havoc more quietly behind the scenes. It’s also possible that it’s not a person but a circumstance, such as a traffic jam that keeps you from getting somewhere on time. Whatever. Let this pass, even if it gets emotional. You’ll have the opportunity to dive back into your projects more efficiently next week.

"
16 october 2016,taurus,"Enough is enough. Today’s full moon falls in your house of closure, and it’s time to reflect upon what’s working in your life and what’s not. This can be tense or painful, but on the other hand it can be cathartic and cleansing. Spontaneous Uranus is close to the Moon, indicating that you could experience an “aha!” moment in which you resolve to close out people, circumstances and thought patterns rather quickly. Leave the past behind and move on.

"
17 october 2016,taurus,"Feed your head! A mind-opening aspect between the Moon and metamorphic Pluto is all about broadening your horizons: traveling more, going back to school maybe, meeting new people, studying philosophy or metaphysics, and basically living a more adventurous life! What’s not to like about that? Take it and run with it!

"
18 october 2016,taurus,"Time to head to Victoria’s Secret. Sexy Venus just glided into your house of sensuality and intimacy for a three-week stay! Lest you think that this is just about canoodling, it’a actually a soulful house where you can bond emotionally and spiritually with another person. Let your feelings show.

"
19 october 2016,taurus,"Mars and Pluto are meeting up today, churning up your desire to make progress in all areas of your life, which is a good thing. However, these are both aggressive little dudes, which means that you could become way too focused on fast results as you eye what’s going on in the lives of others. Control the urge to play the “keeping up with the Joneses” game (or the Kardashians for that matter). Your life is yours alone, and progress can’t be forced. Make sure that you pay attention to the process  of your goal attainment, not just the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

"
20 october 2016,taurus,"A project could get temporarily derailed as a sudden occurrence mucks things up. Maybe it’s self-doubt on your part, or interference from someone who’s determined to just be difficult. You may have seen signs of this brewing toward the end of last week so it may not come as much of a surprise. The recent full moon should have pointed out your own weak points as well as those of others. Since you only have control over yours, start working on them now.

"
21 october 2016,taurus,"With courageous Mars and Pluto both pushing you to move past previous limitations, no one would blame you for feeling a little unsettled. After all, change makes a lot of us a bit edgy. Today you may feel it as the Moon opposes the other two orbs in the heavens. However, this vibe passes within a day or so, but while it’s in play, why not analyze the fears and considerations that may be holding you back?

"
22 october 2016,taurus,"Serious relationships receive a breath of fresh air now that the energetic Sun has entered your seventh house of partnering. Candid Mercury enters this part of your chart on Monday, helping all bulls communicate with their beloved—or a business alliance. Single Taureans won’t be in any mood for playing around; it’s serious commitment time, and the new moon on the 30th is custom made for opening up a brand new chapter in romance for all.

"
23 october 2016,taurus,"The division of labor in a group or team activity may need to be revised in the days ahead. Make sure that you’re not carrying all of the weight, a good possibility with generous, optimistic Jupiter in your work sector. You run the risk of taking on too many responsibilities which will enable others to slack. Don’t let them use guilt or charm to wriggle out of their tasks.

"
24 october 2016,taurus,"Time to have “The Talk” with a romantic partner now that candid Mercury has entered your house of commitment. If you’re already married this is still an excellent period for working out any issues or lingering questions, especially with a new moon in the same part of the sky occurring soon. Singles, don’t waste your time on players, married people or commitment-phobes. It’s all about the real thing right now.

"
25 october 2016,taurus,"Mixed signals! That’s the situation with a confusing Venus-Neptune square. Some of the people closest to you may act in strange ways, running hot-cold, passive-aggressive, decisive then stalling. As a result your emotions may bubble over, but this is a tempest in a teapot. Let it pass. For today, let your own wisdom guide you rather than the opinions of others.

"
27 october 2016,taurus,"Time for “the Talk”? A brilliant Mercury-Sun conjunction in your house of commitment means that it’s time to figure out which direction a relationship is heading in. This goes for business alliances as well. Is it time to hire a booking agent, PR firm or consultant? Or maybe you need to get rid of your existing representatives and find a new one. At the romance level, singles could meet a keeper in the days ahead, and the “just dating” crowd could get a lot more serious.

"
28 october 2016,taurus,"A work colleague, client or friend could be key in helping you land a new job, better assignments or help you switch to a different department. Good things are being said about you as your work ethic speaks for itself. There’s a karmic vibe to this too, as the years you’ve spent developing your craft are about to pay off.

"
29 october 2016,taurus,"A tug-of-war between safety and security versus being adventurous takes place today. Part of you may just want to settle down in a committed relationship, for example, while another side of you desires to explore other “opportunities”. A practical voice in your head tells you to stay at the day job for the regular paycheck and benefits while another little voice whispers to take a chance and become an entrepreneur. The good news is that serious Saturn is in an excellent position in your chart, indicating that whatever decision you make will be based on logic and careful planning.

"
30 october 2016,taurus,"Thinking about teaming up with someone to advance your career? If that’s the case today’s new moon sets the stage for progress–including the financial kind. Whether you form a traditional business partnership or hire someone to represent you (such as a booking agent or PR firm), it has success written all over it. And since this lunation falls in the house of serious relationships, it’s time to find a keeper if you’re single. Attached bulls should plan the next logical step in their romance. Neptune is in quite the amorous mood, so if you don’t have enough sizzle in your life, go out there and find it!

"
31 october 2016,taurus,"There is power in numbers, something that you would be wise to pay attention to this week. Teaming up with someone for a common goal or end result is the way to go, rather than trying to do battle all by yourself. With erratic Uranus acting up, someone or something behind the scenes could throw a monkey wrench into your plans–all the more reason to have someone in your corner.

"
1 november 2016,taurus,"Common ground. You can reach it today with someone close, such as a lover or even a group of colleagues at the office. There may have been confusion in past months about the specific direction to head in with a project or goal. As a matter of fact, there may have been people stalling and obfuscating. But that clears up with a brilliant Sun-Neptune trine.

"
2 november 2016,taurus,"Who needs a warm body? Not you, Taurus! With the passionate Moon swinging past love planet Venus, and other planets in your commitment sector in a lively mood, you’re not going to be interested in having a partner just for the sake of being coupled up. Heck no, this is all about passion, lust and excitement. So if your love life has been a snooze (or nonexistent for that matter) it’s time for a romantic reboot.

"
3 november 2016,taurus,"No man (or woman) is an island, and the planets are encouraging you to team up with others rather than trying to do it all on your own. With the Sun and Mercury in your partnership sector it would be wise to consider the input and assistance another person can provide. An influential person may enter your life in the near future who will open your eyes to brand new possibilities.

"
4 november 2016,taurus,"The planets are increasing your tolerance for risk, but that doesn’t mean that you’re going to quit the day job to sell pina coladas on a Caribbean beach. However, you could  start thinking more about being your own boss. This not only applies to your occupation, but also to taking greater control of your life in general: your education, travel plans, living arrangements and relationships.

"
5 november 2016,taurus,"Still waters run deep, and sometimes they can become a boiling cauldron. Keep your emotions (and therefore your words and actions) under control today as erratic Uranus is pushing your buttons. This isn’t necessarily a problem if you can control the flow of your statements. It can actually be beneficial for you to get your feelings out there so that others know what’s going on inside your head and heart. Just don’t reveal too much too soon.

"
7 november 2016,taurus,"Assertive Mars enters your career house on Wednesday for the first time in two years, but this time around is a game changer. Are you willing to settle for the same old position, salary or even industry? With Saturn in Sag, I would say that the answer is “hell, no!”  It’s time to secure your financial future for decades to come with strong Saturn by your side. Do what it takes to strengthen your foundation.

"
8 november 2016,taurus,"It’s not what you know, it’s who you know, and someone in a position of power may be willing to help you from behind the scenes. If you know of a person— a mentor, industry contact, friend—who’s well-connected, reach out to them today. When Mars enters your house of ambition on Wednesday for the first time in two years, you’ll be quite interested in working those connections.

"
9 november 2016,taurus,"You’re entering a highly productive phase in which your ideas, plans and schemes will be front and center. The full moon in Taurus on the 14th will permit you to step away from other people’s dramas and agendas and attend to your own needs. With assertive Mars entering your house of ambition today for the first time in two years, don’t be surprised if you’re ready to bolt ahead with new projects.

"
10 november 2016,taurus,"Need advice? Call a trusted friend or mentor. They’ll be the best source of information and inspiration today. Now that go-getter Mars is in your house of ambition, you could be overwhelmed by the possibilities and projects that lie ahead. By the time of Monday’s full moon in your sign, you will have developed more clarity and know exactly which path to take.

"
12 november 2016,taurus,"Your outlook for achieving your ambitions is off the charts, Taurus! Mars just entered your success zone, Venus is now in your house of optimism and taking chances, and today Mercury glides into your big-money sector. The messenger planet is also perfectly poised to help you out with matters of the heart, so don’t hold back your words or emotions.

"
13 november 2016,taurus,"The biggest super moon since 1948 arrives tomorrow, and it occurs in your sign! Start creating a short list of the things you’d like to manifest in the year ahead. You may find that others around you–friends, lovers, co-workers–are not as enthusiastic as you are about your dreams, but don’t let that stop you. Look out for #1.

"
14 november 2016,taurus,"Shine a light on me! The biggest super moon since 1948 takes place in your sign, Taurus. It’s time to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight. There’s nothing wrong with putting your needs and dreams on the front burner. Brand new, important cycles can begin now, so spend some time thinking about what you’d like to manifest in the year ahead. But when you start mapping out your path, pay close attention to the details and don’t expect things to happen overnight. Mars in your house of ambition could make you way  too impatient.

"
15 november 2016,taurus,"With aggressive Mars blazing a trail through your house of ambition, nothing is going to stop you from moving forward with things that are important to you. But you would be wise to keep your own counsel today rather than listening to the advice of others, including “friends”. A tense Moon-Neptune aspect that people around you may be trying to dissuade you from making progress. This energy reappears on Friday, so stay on your toes.

"
16 november 2016,taurus,"The role that you play in a romantic or business partnership may need to be adjusted, Taurus, and this is an issue that could get touchy. If you feel that you’ve been taking on too much responsibility in the relationship, you must let the other person know where you stand. Likewise, it may be your turn to pick up some of the slack. Either way, the situation plays out nicely, as you both will be breathing a sigh of relief once you’ve aired your opinions.

"
17 november 2016,taurus,"You may think that you know everything there is to expressing your opinions and deepest feelings, but the planets indicate that your communication skills could use some polishing up. But part of the problem lately also seems to be defensiveness on your part. Are you suspicious of the motives of friends or a loved one? Ask yourself that question before you start to rant, accuse or whimper. Make sure you have the facts first.

"
18 november 2016,taurus,"Keep your wits about you and don’t make any major decisions today, Taurus. Confusing Neptune is stirring up some pretty murky waters, and they could be coming from someone close. They may be trying to push your buttons to gain some kind of emotional advantage over you, something you certainly don’t need. The recent full moon fell in your sign, and it was designed to help you kick off brand new cycles. If someone in your circle doesn’t fit, it may be time to cut the tie and move on.

"
19 november 2016,taurus,"It’s time to clean house, but I’m not talking about your abode. I’m referring to the network of people in your life, from friends to industry contacts to people in volunteer organizations you’re involved in. If someone doesn’t have your best interests at heart, nor the good of the group, they need to be removed. How you handle this—gently or grittily—is up to you. A positive Venus-Neptune aspect today indicates that some big plans of yours are about to take flight. You don’t need any baggage holding you back!

"
20 november 2016,taurus,"You’ll be in a far sultrier mood over the next four weeks once the Sun enters Sagittarius tomorrow. With the Moon in your domestic sector today winking at unpredictable Uranus, it’s time to turn your bedroom into a boudoir. Or a lair. Your choice. Head out to the store and stock up on some new sheets, pillows, candles and room fragrance. You can thank me later.

"
21 november 2016,taurus,"Open book? You may become one over the next four weeks now that the Sun is in your house of intimacy and sharing. But are the people around you as candid? Consider that over the next week, as planetary influences warn you to selectively share your opinions and emotions. Next week’s new moon on the 29th ushers in a new phase in which you may decide to trust your gut more than what others say or do.

"
22 november 2016,taurus,"Time is money, and that old saying applies to you today, Taurus. Becoming more efficient is the name of the game, and today intelligent Mercury will help you uncover new habits and tips that will streamline your work flow. The more productive you become, the more money you’ll end up having in your wallet. It’s as simple as that.

"
23 november 2016,taurus,"Close relationships reach a turning point with an important Saturn-Mercury meeting. If someone hasn’t been sharing their thoughts or their heart with you 100%, it’s time for a serious talk. Naturally, this isn’t always easy. But with a new moon arriving next week in this part of your chart, it’s wise to start discussions right now.

"
24 november 2016,taurus,"Can’t see the forest for the trees? A touchy Jupiter-Pluto aspect today indicates that you may be nitpicking or focusing on small details that don’t count. In doing so, you misunderstand or miss the point about a person or situation. A more open-minded point of view starts to spread through your mind on Friday, like a fresh breeze blowing gently through a window. Eventually you’ll be able to see the big picture as it really is.

"
25 november 2016,taurus,"With so many planets situated in the parts of the chart that deal with your deepest emotions, it’s not surprising if you’re doing a lot of soul searching. A cathartic Venus-Pluto aspect helps you release pent up feelings and to be honest not only with the people closest to you, but also yourself. It’s time to let go of feelings that may have been holding you back, and today’s energy is perfect for that fresh start.

"
27 november 2016,taurus,"Your attitudes and philosophy about life are changing, Taurus, and it’s safe to say that by this time next year, you won’t be the same person. But this is all for the best. With Uranus in the most hidden part of your chart you may not be ready to let the world know what you’re thinking, at least not in the near future. But that will change in December as you increasingly get in touch with your deepest feelings.

"
28 november 2016,taurus,"Sometimes it’s wiser to only pay attention to facts and logic; other times it’s better to rely on your gut. The problem is lately that your brain and your gut are sending you mixed signals, creating confusion as to which direction to head in. The fog lifts with Tuesday’s new moon. It will provide a happy balance of rational thought along with a solid emotional foundation.

"
29 november 2016,taurus,"You’re now in an excellent position to build wealth, courtesy of today’s new moon in your house of fiscal responsibility. However, don’t expect overnight results with anything you undertake: starting a business, investing in mutual funds, writing a best selling book or pursuing a court case. Sober, serious Saturn is in an excellent position to support the Moon (and therefore your goals) but this is also the planet of slow, steady achievement.

"
30 november 2016,taurus,"You may want to keep an invisible wall up today between you and others as deceptive Neptune is active. This is especially true of friends, acquaintances, co-workers and people who are on a team with you. Someone in your circle may not be straightforward or honest, or they may be expecting you to carry the load. Be friendly, cooperate but look out for #1.

1 december 2016,taurus,"December starts off with a bang! An energetic meet up between Mars and Jupiter helps put your career goals in high gear. Take charge of your future and start acting on ideas that you have for advancement. With lucky and optimistic Jupiter in your house of the “daily grind”, you should be able to uncover ways to become more efficient—and time is money.

"
2 december 2016,taurus,"Despite the fact that aggressive Mars is tearing through your house of ambition and goals, you should set aside time for enjoyable pursuits. And with Mercury entering your house of adventure today, you should be able to dream up at least a few fun things that should be added to your bucket list. Like: learning how to cook French cuisine, trekking through the Andes Mountains, taking a hot air balloon ride or learning how to flamenco dance. The thing about bucket lists, though, is they need to be acted upon! So stop waiting and start planning—and doing.

"
3 december 2016,taurus,"It’s time to get serious about building a strong financial foundation: retirement money, college funds for the kids, solid health benefits and a substantial savings account. Fortunately, Mars is actively ratcheting up your ambition to earn more, so consider your options. Reach out today to the people who can help you take on more responsibility and earn more cash. Next Tuesday is excellent for some private brainstorming.

"
4 december 2016,taurus,"Practicality is the word o’ the week with dynamic Mars forming a helpful angle with Jupiter. Whatever your plans may be for your family, finances, career, or love life, it’s imperative to keep it real. Today you may become inspired to get off your duff and take action, which is a wise move. The cosmos will be pushing you to make some big decisions between now and the full moon on the 13th.

"
5 december 2016,taurus,"Finding a balance between being assertive and secretive is your challenge today, Taurus. The cosmos is currently telling you to go within for wisdom and to keep some things to yourself. On the other hand you need to communicate with others and let them know you’re in charge. Call it diplomacy, call it discretion, but either way, the world isn’t entitled to know your deepest thoughts…or agenda.

"
6 december 2016,taurus,"Stop putting off self-care, hoping that “someday” in the future you’ll have the time to read that book, get a massage or start a mindfulness meditation practice. The cosmos tells you that now is the time to nurture yourself and that you need to take charge of your level of serenity and contentment. To your surprise, you may find that just spending a half hour on yourself brings so many benefits that you decide to dig in and make this a regular practice.

"
7 december 2016,taurus,"The holidays may be coming, but don’t even think about putting your career on the back burner until after New Year’s. That’s because magnetic Venus enters your house of ambition today, urging you to reach out to people who can take your aspirations to the next level. This is also the house of all  of your big goals, so now is the time to plan your 2017 resolutions.

"
8 december 2016,taurus,"With Mars, Venus and the Moon all in your house of ambition today, it’s an understatement to say that you’re on a roll. Just don’t roll over other people in your desire to get ahead. You’re actually better off keeping your own counsel and not letting others know what you’re up to these days. Think “stealth” and not calling attention to yourself.

"
9 december 2016,taurus,"Hunt down productive hacks that will streamline your life, both at home and the office. With next week’s full moon falling in your house of making mo’ money, you definitely need to become more productive if you want to earn and save more. There is an emotional payoff to getting your act together: an increased feeling of self-worth and greater peace of mind.

"
10 december 2016,taurus,"A funky mood could pervade serious relationships today as stern Saturn forces you to face reality. The same holds true for your finances. If you’re overspending and under saving, it’s time to develop some fiscal responsibility. Not getting what you need from a lover? Then get real and get out. Next week’s full moon falls in your house of self-worth, and if yours is low, you need to get clear as to why.

"
11 december 2016,taurus,"If you feel like busting loose from the ideals of society, or your family, or your friends, there’s a good reason! The Moon forms a spunky aspect today with metamorphic Pluto in the most adventurous part of your chart. Playing it safe and conforming to the rules isn’t going to appear very appetizing. Let’s face it, did all the great artists, scientists, inventors and authors produce their masterpieces by following the status quo? Hell no. They turned it upside down.

"
12 december 2016,taurus,"Financial security is the name of the game these days as the cosmos focuses on building wealth for you, Taurus. Pay close attention to your gut hunches as your intuition can guide you into making smart decisions. If something seems to good to be true, avoid it; with tomorrow’s full moon in your house of security you need to make sure that everything, from your income to investments, is rock solid.

"
13 december 2016,taurus,"Fiscal responsibility is the name of the game with today’s full moon in your house of earnings. You’re in a terrific spot to score a raise, bonus or new job, but make saving money a priority. If you’re looking for a new job, don’t assume that the week after Christmas is going to be dead. The cosmos is dishing up positive career aspects every day from the 26th through the 30th.

"
14 december 2016,taurus,"Keep your head down at the office today as a tense Uranus-Jupiter aspect could fray your nerves. Co-workers and clients may be raring to go with a project or idea, but you seem to be holding back. Problem is, if you voice your concerns there could be pushback. Your best bet is to keep your mouth shut and go along with the crowd—just for today. When Mars enters Pisces next week you’ll be more willing to be a team player.

"
15 december 2016,taurus,"Something may happen today that will let you see a person or a situation for what they really are and it may come as a bit of a surprise. It could be a statement or an action. It also could be an intuitive hit that you receive from the cosmos. But voicing it is not wise under current planetary conditions. As a matter of fact, once Mercury retrogrades next Monday in your opinionated ninth house it would be wise to keep a lot of thoughts to yourself. Become more of an observer than a talker.

"
17 december 2016,taurus,"You can get to the bottom of an issue that has either perplexed you or has been a source of worry. And the good news is that the solution to this dilemma may arrive on the scene very quickly. Once you get everything settled, your peace of mind should increase dramatically, although the planets indicate that you may need to make some changes on a personal, emotional level. New habits such as mindfulness, or refusing to judge people and situations could help you enormously.

"
18 december 2016,taurus,"With aggressive Mars wrapping up its tour through your house of ambition today, you may be wiped out. Summon up the energy to put the finishing touches on goals and projects you’re working on. Then get ready to party as the energetic red planet blasts into your house of friends and networking tomorrow. This should be a far more social holiday season than in years past!

"
19 december 2016,taurus,"Over the next seven weeks, your grandest schemes can begin to take flight. Dynamic Mars has just entered your eleventh house of long-held dreams, and networking with others may well be the best way to achieve them. However, with Mercury retrograding in the house of skill development and learning new perspectives, it’s critical to take your time and make sure that you have the right stuff before you lift off.

"
20 december 2016,taurus,"Double check your holiday travel plans now that Mercury has retrograded in this part of your chart. Likewise, if you’re going to book a vacation between now and January 12th, make sure that you receive confirmations and go over them for mistakes. The same holds true for college applications, term papers and dissertations, marketing plans, manuscripts, screen plays, and any applications that deal with government agencies, such as citizenship or the division of motor vehicles. Mercury is back spinning in the part of your chart that’s known as the “far and wide” sector—traveling long distances, getting your message out to the masses, or expressing yourself in a very public way.

"
21 december 2016,taurus,"Woo-hoo! The Sun moves into the most adventurous part of your chart today, asking you to take some calculated risks. Maybe it’s time to leave that soul sucking job or move across country. Perhaps you need to start dating different kinds of people. And while you’re it, shouldn’t you stop talking about “someday”? Someday I’ll write that book, start that business, patent my invention, travel around the world, leave my husband. Someday is here, and the time is now.

"
22 december 2016,taurus,"If you’re sick and tired of routines and doing things the same old way, you can blame it on the emotional Moon meeting up with Jupiter in your house of getting things done. But what’s wrong with shaking things up a little bit? If the tried and true isn’t working, should you keep doing it? Maybe it’s time to break out of a rut and forge a new path.

"
23 december 2016,taurus,"Even thought the holiday slowdown is about to begin, this is the perfect day to network with people whom you’d like to partner with in 2017. They could be business contacts, local parents, people in your church group, members of a volunteer organization, or your pals. Likewise, think about seminars or trade shows that could be helpful to your personal and career development. Tuesday the 27th is a good day to take these plans further.

"
24 december 2016,taurus,"Emotions ride high today with an energetic Saturn-Uranus trine. Passion for a lover can increase, or just a passion to live life more fully! Why hide in the shadows when you can be living large and loving life? With Uranus in a self-reflective place, it’s not surprising that you would be thinking deeply about the future. The new moon on the 29th is the time to kick off new initiatives.

"
25 december 2016,taurus,"You’ll be stepping into a more authoritative role in the weeks ahead, whether that’s at work, a volunteer organization you’re part of, or a family matter. So relax and enjoy the day. But the word “authoritative” doesn’t mean grim or nose to the grindstone; on the contrary, there will be a lot of fun and optimism with this.

"
27 december 2016,taurus,"“When you wish upon a star, your dreams will take you very far..”  So sang the group Earth, Wind and Fire back in the ’70’s. Well Taurus, today’s your day to dream big with a super Mars-Sun connection. The fact that these two dynamic orbs are teaming up right before 2017 begins is highly auspicious. Start planning what you’d like to manifest now, and don’t wait for January 1st to get going. The new moon on the 29th is your best time to launch.

"
28 december 2016,taurus,"My, aren’t we anxious! A super charged meeting between the Sun and Mars in two of the most visionary and optimistic parts of your chart are firing up your desire to make some big changes. One of the things you need to consider today is the image that you present to the world, and that includes your brand if you have one. Perception is reality to many people, and whether that’s fair or not is another issue. Get into your A game.

"
29 december 2016,taurus,"Just say “Ohmmm.” Uranus finishes back stroking through the house of your subconscious mind. Over the past five months you may have wrestled with fears, dramas, and negative thought patterns. Now that the quirky planet is moving direct, greater peace of mind should be coming your way. It’s the perfect time to open your mind to ancient or foreign philosophies, such as Zen Buddhism, thanks to a new moon taking place in your house of learning.

"
30 december 2016,taurus,"Yesterday’s new moon sparkled with possibilities for the future, and today is perfect for delving into one of them. What would make you the happiest in 2017? If it’s something that requires a little research, get started now. When Mars and Neptune meet up on New Year’s Day in the house of your deepest hopes and wishes, all systems are “go”.

"
31 december 2016,taurus,"Some of the not so pleasant emotions that have been troubling you for awhile may start to dissipate, thanks to a helpful aspect between Saturn and Uranus. Healing can take years or it can happen in an instant, and it seems as though you’ll be able to close out past dramas more quickly than you thought possible.

"
1 january 2017,gemini,"My, my, aren’t we motivated! With a powerhouse meeting of Mars and Neptune in your house of ambition and success, you are definitely  determined to make your mark this year. “If I can dream it, I can do it” is your motto, Gemini, but you have to be mindful of just one thing: keep your feet on the ground. Foggy Neptune is inspirational, yes, but when it teams up with Mars you run the risk of boldly charging down a path without giving a lot of logical thought to what you’re doing. Slow down.

"
2 january 2017,gemini,"You have some big plans for the near future in mind, but the cosmos suggests that you slow down and get more of the picture before you move ahead. The problem is that you may be operating too much on emotion and not enough on logic, thanks to the vibey Moon meeting up with foggy Neptune today. If career or other projects require the input or cooperation of someone else, get in touch with them between tomorrow and the 8th to review plans.

"
3 january 2017,gemini,"2017 kicked off with Mars and Neptune firing up your house of ambition and success, and now magnetic Venus joins them for a four week stay. Getting up every day and doing work that you love will become more important to you, and the new moon on the 27th will increase your optimism that it can happen. There is a strong financial focus for you in January that will help you follow your bliss–logically, carefully and with a solid financial foundation.

"
4 january 2017,gemini,"Passion rules! The next week could be quite a steamy one in the boudoir, Gemini, but it could also create confusion in romance. That’s because Mercury retrogrades today into your house of commitment, bringing up issues from the past that need to be resolved. At the same time the Sun and Pluto move ever closer in your house of libido, stirring up emotions and desires. Don’t let sex or lust blind you to matters that must be straightened out.

"
5 january 2017,gemini,"Power struggles may be building in some kind of team effort, such as a department at work, a family reunion or wedding, a volunteer effort or among friends. Someone could push your buttons today, or perhaps the whole scene is just getting on your nerves. Take a breather and try to take the long view. As next week’s full moon approaches on the 12th, this nonsense could intensify, so if you can cut off any negative thoughts about it now the better off you’ll be.

"
6 january 2017,gemini,"The desire to be on the same page with someone isn’t the same as actually being there! And an emotional Moon aspect today could fire up your wishes to be in agreement with another party, be they business or personal. Not to worry. When Mercury resumes direct motion on Sunday you’ll be able to communicate more freely. Truth be told, over the month of January you’ll have to continue to negotiate with others, especially on the 10th, 11th and 19th. This energy will be in play for several weeks, so patience is key.

"
7 january 2017,gemini,"The eighth house in astrology is all about sharing with others: your body, soul and even your financial assets. Yup, we’re talking about sex, intimacy and money! And today two of the most persuasive orbs in the cosmos, the Sun and Pluto, hold a convo in this part of your chart. Your emotions and passion could rise in matters of the heart, as you may experience intense desire for someone else—but are they right for you? Pluto is all about domination and control, so you have to watch the tendency to go into dictator mode in love. But being a powerhouse in finance is another story, so step into that role and make the cash register ring!

"
8 january 2017,gemini,"Swing back into action with business deals–Mercury goes direct today, freeing up stalled contracts and joint ventures. The messenger planet has been retro in your house of serious partnerships, which includes romantic alliances, so if there has been tension and crossed lines with your amour things should start to smooth over. You need to get matters straightened out before the full moon on Thursday, which will shine its light on the state of your union: how strong it is and how secure you feel.

"
9 january 2017,gemini,"Keep the BS meter powered up today, as it could get pretty deep. Someone may try to pull rank as they’re tossing those bull chips, so don’t be surprised if a boss or a boss wannabe is acting out. This could also be a lover, client, banker or anyone else who perceives themselves to be higher and mightier than the rest. With the Moon in Gemini, you could become too emotional for your own good, so count to ten and let ’em rant. Namaste.

"
10 january 2017,gemini,"Be careful where you invest or spend your hard earned money today, as a difficult Sun-Uranus aspect could affect your ability to make a sound decision. Likewise, don’t be pressured into doing anything  you don’t want to do, and that includes your personal relationships. With the Sun in the most passionate part of your chart you’re relying more on feelings than logic, and someone may try to take advantage of that.

"
11 january 2017,gemini,"Power struggles may be erupting in key relationships both at work and in your personal life, so you need to watch your moods and temper. Tomorrow’s full moon falls in your house of security and guarantees, possible making you keenly aware that you need more money, commitment or help from others. But are they willing to cooperate? Just make sure that you’re not the one acting in a domineering manner. If others do, put them in their place.

"
12 january 2017,gemini,"Today the cosmos delivers a full moon in Cancer, your annual opportunity to land a higher paying job, a promotion, or to take your company’s revenues to a much higher level. This lunation may finally see something come to a happy conclusion, something that you’ve been working on for some time. But separating the wheat from the chaff is the issue thanks to a Grand Cross that could make decision making difficult. Examine the fine print on financial documents and job offers and know exactly which responsibilities will be yours in the future (and those of other people). Don’t assume that a team has its act together or that a creative vision is on point. Do your homework before making a decision.

"
13 january 2017,gemini,"One thing’s for sure–you want guarantees about the future, and that means in all areas of your life. A happy meet up between Venus and Neptune is designed to put things in greater focus for you. Your romance, finances and overall peace of mind can all benefit from the greater sense of security that is building inside of you. The key is to take off the rose-colored glasses and see people and situations for what they really are first.

"
14 january 2017,gemini,"Some pretty sweet financial opportunities could be coming your way, but you must be realistic about them. Whether it’s a new job, a joint venture or investing money in a retirement account, make sure that you have all the details before you sign on the dotted line. The possibility exists that you may be too starry eyed, expecting overnight success. The outlook really is good, especially after the Sun enters Aquarius next Thursday, but you shouldn’t count your chickens before they hatch.

"
15 january 2017,gemini,"Got guilt? If someone is trying to make you feel like you owe them something, Gemini, it may get on your nerves! Whether the other person thinks that they need love, money, a favor, a job or your undivided attention, it seems that they’re pushing it. Draw some boundaries, otherwise you’ll end up being a doormat.

"
16 january 2017,gemini,"Financial opportunities surround you, some of which could really add to your net worth. But do you see them? Start paying attention. With dynamic Mars in your house of ambition and powerhouse Pluto in the net worth sector, you may need to do things differently to get ahead. But then every millionaire eventually figured that out!

"
17 january 2017,gemini,"Matters of the heart can be a roller coaster this week, so put on your seat belt. Today emotions can bubble up to the surface, especially resentment and fear. If a lover isn’t willing to communicate it will only serve to piss you off even more. Wait until tomorrow to talk, but know this: if you want this situation to be resolved, you’re going to have to take ownership of it.

"
18 january 2017,gemini,"Goal oriented? You should be, considering that energetic Mars is now in the success and ambition part of your chart. Today is stellar for making progress with something that’s important to you as Mars forms a helpful aspect with bountiful Jupiter. Fresh new creative ideas can come your way, concepts that may change the way you’ve been going about things. But these are beneficial. Remember, do things the way you’ve always done and you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.

"
19 january 2017,gemini,"Roadblocks! That’s what you may be facing in love and career matters as the two most stubborn planets in the cosmos square each other today. Mars, who wanted everything yesterday, is annoyed with Saturn, who claims that long term success comes from slow and steady improvement. It’s the classic tortoise and hare scenario. So what’s a Gemini to do? Stay calm, because this energy continues into next week. Things should start to gain momentum after the new moon on the 27th.

"
20 january 2017,gemini,"Impatient, are we? The Sun just entered the most visionary part of your chart, a good thing. And red hot Mars is in your house of ambition—which can also be a blessing. The downside, however, is that this potent mix could lead to frustration and impatience that events aren’t happening fast enough. Under current planetary influences you will  need the cooperation of other people to achieve your aims. They should start to support you more after the 28th.

"
21 january 2017,gemini,"It may be the weekend but it’s a super time to work on passion projects, and if that includes career growth, so be it. A cluster of planets in your ambition sector are in a terrific angle to the Moon in your “let’s do this” house of efficiency. You can accomplish a lot on your own over the next week, and when Mars enters Aries on the 28th you will do even better by woking with others.

"
22 january 2017,gemini,"The Sun is now in the most visionary part of your chart, pushing you to go past previous self limitations. But you won’t be doing this on your own as planetary aspects indicate that you’ll need the cooperation of others. A cooperative Moon-Sun angle today suggests that you talk over future plans with loved ones. Are you on the same page? Try to get there now, as February will be a big month for forward momentum.

"
23 january 2017,gemini,"Long term relationships of all kinds are in the cosmos’s crosshairs for you today, Gemini. A Moon-Saturn conjunction in the part of your chart that deals with partnerships shines its light on alliances of both a personal or business nature. It’s quite possible that an offer could come your way for a job, a date, a joint business venture or the opportunity to join a group that you’ve longed to be a member of. This entire week is an active one in the heavens, so stay on your toes.

"
24 january 2017,gemini,"Which way is up? You’re going to have to get clear about which way you’re heading, whether it’s a solo effort or an alliance with a partner or group. The good news is that the planet of inspiration, Neptune, is in your ambition sector. So is magnetic Venus and assertive Mars. The problem is that they may be presenting your mind with so many options that it seems like you’re standing on line at a buffet, not knowing which yummy delicacy to go after. Fortunately intelligent Mercury steps in and helps you make the choice that brings you the most passion.

"
25 january 2017,gemini,"Feel like life is just dishing up the same old s*** day after day? Well, the cosmos wants to change that for you. Metamorphic Pluto and smart little Mercury are currently in your house of passion, and today they’re joined by the emotional Moon. It’s possible that you could feel annoyed or drained from being in a rut. On the other hand, you could feel energized and ready to rock and roll. Either way, momentum is starting to build as you become a lot more motivated to pursue a meaningful life. And this is just the warmup: the real action starts with Friday’s new moon.

"
26 january 2017,gemini,"Toss out old ways of thinking and take a fresh approach! With three planets in your house of ambition, chances are you’re anxious to get important plans underway. Nothing wrong with that, but the planets are telling you today to be more creative and think more in big picture, conceptual ways. This energy is only going to increase after tomorrow’s new moon in the most free spirited part of your chart. Chasing your passions shouldn’t be a drag—it should bring you joy!

"
27 january 2017,gemini,"Today’s new moon in Aquarius is making you more than ready to soar to new heights, but is everyone around you ready to do the same? This is especially true in serious romantic relationships due to a harsh Venus-Saturn square. You may be looking for guarantees from a lover that they’re not ready to give, or perhaps it’s the other way around. That being said, the atmosphere bodes well for discussion. It may be simply a matter of getting more intimately acquainted with the other person’s thoughts and feelings before progress can be made. Singles, you’re perfectly positioned to meet a sexy flame who’s quite a break from the usual type.

"
28 january 2017,gemini,"Expect your social calendar to start filling up as energizer bunny Mars barrels into your eleventh house of fun, parties, networking, trade events, and charity work. This also happens to be the sector that governs technology, so now is the time to launch or develop a website, blog, online store or app. Yesterday’ s new moon in your house of international business dealings means that these projects could really take off.

"
29 january 2017,gemini,"Comparing your life to others’ is never a good idea as we never really know what’s going on in someone else’s life. People post a lot of happy-happy stuff on their social media sites that may induce envy but isn’t grounded in reality. Beware the tendency of playing the comparison game, a possibility under current planetary aspects. Now that Mars is in your house of networking and camaraderie, you could be in a quite social mood. But keep a close eye on your emotions.

"
30 january 2017,gemini,"Being idealistic is fine as long as you don’t enter the land of foo-foo fantasies that can’t be achieved. You’re in quite the visionary place right now, thanks to a number of planetary aspects that are opening your mind to new possibilities. But a Moon-Neptune conjunction today warns that you’ve got to keep it real. That being said, their meeting could fire up the passion you need to make things happen.

"
31 january 2017,gemini,"The cosmos is telling you to get serious about developing a strong financial footing, and you’d be wise to listen. The issue is that the Sun and Mars are in houses that encourage adventure, entrepreneurship, attending a university, and being part of fun events like wedding parties or group vacations–all of which cost money. You need to temper your enthusiasm. Either create a short list of the things that absolutely must have funding now, or find thriftier ways to do all of them.

"
1 february 2017,gemini,"It’s your life, Gemini, and you should march to the beat of your own drum. But today you might be getting way too much unsolicited advice from people around you who say they have your best interests at heart. The truth is that they may, but only you  really understand what makes you tick. Likewise, don’t waste your precious time comparing yourself to others.

"
2 february 2017,gemini,"No man or woman is an island, and we often have to work with others, whether it’s planning a family reunion, the PTO bake sale or a brainstorming group at the office. The planets suggest that group activities need to be readjusted so that everyone is operating upon a more rational level rather than an emotional one. Obviously you can’t control what others will say or do, but you don’t have to participate in unnecessary dramas and diva meltdowns.

"
3 february 2017,gemini,"Work the room! The next four weeks are super for networking, regardless whether it’s for finding new love or a new gig. Now that Venus is in your friendship sector the possibility of meeting influential people increases dramatically. Mastermind groups, bachelorette parties, family reunions and community organizations are all well aspected. However, on March 4th Venus retrogrades here, which may mean culling frenemies and people whose friendship you’ve outgrown. Make a short list.

"
5 february 2017,gemini,"La Luna is in your sign today Gemini, which could make you reflective about your plans, emotional even. But try not to make any major decisions or launch something new until next Friday. Right now Neptune is obscuring facts and smart plans of action, but the stimulating Leo eclipse on Friday will burn away the fog. Swing into action then as the aspects are perfect for strategizing, talking about your plans with others, learning more and thinking bigger.

"
6 february 2017,gemini,"Got call blocking? You may need it, Gemini! Jupiter retrogrades in your romance sector for the next four months, dredging up exes who may try to resurrect a relationship. Even if no one returns from the past, your love life could slow down a bit. Maybe you decide to take a breather from dating. Perhaps you start to put the brakes on an existing romance that needs to have issues worked out before you can take the next step. Having a baby may need to wait in order for you to save up money first. This time period isn’t a deal breaker, but a good time to make smart decisions after giving them enough thought.

"
7 february 2017,gemini,"Tell it like it is! Now that verbal Mercury is in your worldly, highly opinionated ninth house your ideas can take you far. Your horizons can broaden under this aspect, so consider what you can do to live life a little bit bigger–by signing up for a class, traveling to a part of the world you’ve never been to, or learning a new skill for starters. Friday’s lunar eclipse is custom made for expansion and initiating projects.

"
8 february 2017,gemini,"Don’t be surprised if you feel like you can’t keep everyone happy today, Gemini! From friends to kids to a lover, everyone wants a piece of you and they may be in a button-pushing mood. While this might rock your equilibrium, know that this weekend’s lunar eclipse is perfect for speaking your mind.

"
9 february 2017,gemini,"Yowza! Your brain is on fire, Gemini, as the Sun in your house of visionary thinking winks at rebellious Uranus in the big plans sector. If there was ever a moment to toss out old, outmoded, “little” ways of thinking it’s now. This is an “if I can dream it I can do it” kind of aspect. The good news is that Friday’s lunar eclipse can help you take grandiose ideas and cut them down into workable chunks.

"
10 february 2017,gemini,"As comedienne Joan Rivers used to say, “Can we talk?” You’re not known as being the wallflower of the zodiac, Gemini, but even you  are about to become a heck of a lot more social and chatty. Tonight’s lunar eclipse in Leo falls in your house of self-expression: the way you think, write, speak, and communicate your thoughts through creative means, like a book or a video. A super Moon-Uranus trine indicates that some visionary ideas of yours could be met with acclaim, so get ready to dazzle your colleagues or industry. On a personal level you can make progress with a lover as serious Saturn is in a good angle. Singles, this lunation could help you meet someone in the neighborhood, so look your best—not just today but over the next few months.

"
11 february 2017,gemini,"“Joie de vivre” means enjoying life, and that’s what the cosmos is encouraging you to do more often. A meeting of the two most optimistic orbs, Jupiter and the Sun, tells you to carve out time for enjoying the people, hobbies and events that put a smile on your face. This includes putting yourself out there and being open to new experiences and connections. You only live once, but of you do it right, that’s all you need.

"
12 february 2017,gemini,"Don’t give up your personal power today, as the planets warn that someone may try to take over a situation or project that you’re involved in. Whoever tries to do so is in for a big surprise, especially after the 18th. That’s when the mighty Sun enters your house of authority and ambition, putting you in the driver’s seat. Then the solar eclipse on the 26th will leave no doubt as to who’s in charge–you.

"
13 february 2017,gemini,"Just how ready are you for jumping in to the “deep end” of life? The Sun and Mercury are both in your house of adventure, encouraging you to dive in. But the emotional Moon is stirring up fears, telling you to stay safe in your little cocoon. Fortunately they’re in a conciliatory mood, willing to reach a compromise. You can take some chances without taking major risks.

"
14 february 2017,gemini,"With the cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, in your house of deep friendship, it’s important to not only have a sizzling sex life with a lover, but to be their best friend as well. Singles, your tribe is the best source of introductions on Valentine’s Day, so head out to a party or restaurant and start mingling. Your sign is the envy of the zodiac considering that the planet of long-term success, Saturn, is in the commitment sector! Today it forms a sparkling aspect with the Sun in the house of optimism and taking chances. Date a new type, or open yourself up and become more vulnerable with a lover.

"
15 february 2017,gemini,"Romance revs up with a happy Moon-Jupiter aspect, but don’t over romanticize a union. It’s critical that you’re realistic about shared goals and values. This holds true also in business, especially when it comes to the overall vision for a project. Your creativity is soaring. However, others may not be too quick to accept your visionary talents. That will change after the Sun enters Pisces on Saturday.

"
16 february 2017,gemini,"There’s an old saying, “Attitude is everything” and truer words were never spoken. You can choose to look at the glass half empty, but under the current positive planetary aspects, chances are you’ll be looking at it as being half full. Your upbeat attitude will be noticed by others, people who might want to travel with you on your journey through life.

"
17 february 2017,gemini,"Duty calls, Gemini. Take some time today or over the weekend to get your chores done and become a heck of a lot more organized. With so much planetary energy going on in the lofty and visionary parts of your chart, you may be more inclined right now to just focus on the big picture. Sorry, but ya gotta tend to the grunt work first.

"
18 february 2017,gemini,"Like a horse at the gate, you’re ready to take off like a shot. The Sun and Mercury have been stirring up your house of adventure and thinking big; now the Sun moves into the place where you can actually make them happen. Over the next four weeks you can make important headway with plans that you’ve been considering for awhile. The best time to launch them? The solar eclipse on the 26th. Start planning now.

"
19 february 2017,gemini,"Now that the Sun is in your career sector, you may be thinking about who can help you make headway with your income and reputation. With the Moon in your partnership house, consider new alliances that will benefit not only you but the other person or group. A strong and positive give-and-take vibe is at play this week.

"
20 february 2017,gemini,"If you’ve been craving more freedom and spontaneity lately, then get ready–the cosmos is getting ready to deliver it to you. Perhaps the boss gives you more creative freedom, or you decide to quit your job to pursue your own enterprise. Maybe you plan a trip to a far off destination that’s been on your bucket list for eons. A romance can take on a more relaxed, exciting atmosphere. Roll with it, Gemini!

"
21 february 2017,gemini,"A new level of closeness can be reached with someone today, thanks to a happy Mercury-Jupiter trine. You may need to let bygones be bygones in order to form a stronger bond, but so be it. Thursday is another good day to make progress.

"
22 february 2017,gemini,"Keep an eye out for bossy types today, as obstinate Mars squares off against power-hungry Pluto. This could occur at the office, in a romantic relationship or even in some kind of group effort, like the PTO. Don’t let this person derail your efforts or those of a team. They’re not above playing head games and pushing emotional buttons, so stay calm and use logic as your weapon.

"
23 february 2017,gemini,"New opportunities are coming your way: socially, in business and for travel and adventure. But you won’t be flying solo, at least not if you want to enjoy these experiences to the fullest. Think about whom you’d like to take along on your journey–and expect to meet some new faces along the way.

"
24 february 2017,gemini,"Major planetary activity is just about ready to take place in your highly ambitious tenth house, but the planets want you to have a really good time before you buckle down and get to work. A happy Moon-Venus trine today tells you to book a vacation, plan an adventure or just make plans to see your pals this weekend. Once next Monday rolls around it’s time to get more serious.

"
25 february 2017,gemini,"Now that Mercury is in your success and ambition sector it’s time to think about where you’re heading in all areas of your life. Mercury is a highly mental planet, fond of analyzing and coming up with smart strategies. Get out a pad of paper and a pen and start brainstorming. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in this part of your chart is the perfect launch opportunity.

"
26 february 2017,gemini,"Sweet success! It’s coming your way, thanks to a solar eclipse in your house of ambition and making things happen. This is the last in a series of eclipses that began back in 2015, so if you’ve been hard at work with any goal of your choosing, you could reap the rewards over the next six months. However, in the days ahead you may need to pull away from people in your circle for some serious focusing.

"
27 february 2017,gemini,"“To thine own self be true.” This is a nice way of saying that from time to time ya just gotta look out for yourself, and that’s OK. If people around you want to be absorbed in theatrics and dilemmas that’s their choice. But you have so much positive planetary energy pushing you to go after  your big dreams that you just can’t waste too much time on unnecessary drama. These folks will just have to figure it out for themselves.

"
28 february 2017,gemini,"The solar eclipse on Sunday has kick started your ambitions, so take this energy and run with it! Yes, you’ll need the help of people along the way, and it’s smart to have confidantes and mentors. But you don’t  need to be engaged in unnecessary drama and time-sucking commitments that aren’t worth it right now. It may not be easy, but some people and activities may need to go.

"
1 march 2017,gemini,"Thinking about which direction to head in with your career? Then the next few days will be highly inspirational. A terrific Sun-Neptune aspect will provide you with fresh ideas and the motivation to run with them. This is a good time to step into your power, by the way, which may mean ignoring the noise coming from friends and family. It’s time to be true to yourself.

"
3 march 2017,gemini,"Passion is wonderful, whether you’re pouring it into your romance, raising your kids, your hobbies or your job. But sometimes you need to dial it down a notch and let cool, rational thought take over. A conflict may be brewing in your mind right now about this, and when Venus retrogrades on Saturday it would be wise to go the rational route. Focus on being objective versus subjective over the next four weeks.

"
4 march 2017,gemini,"Questions may begin to arise about the company you keep now that Venus has gone retrograde in your house of friends and close connections. Sometimes we outgrow our friends; other times we simply realize that they’re coming from a completely different place than we are. The same holds true for lovers, where not being in agreement can create waves. It may be difficult to decipher what’s going on, but things should improve after the 13th.

"
5 march 2017,gemini,"Getting on the same page with someone close should be easier than usual over the next few days thanks to a productive Mars-Saturn meeting. This is especially true in romance, so make an attempt to understand your lover’s viewpoint. Singles are in a good spot to meet someone, with your best luck being at an event. Think book signing, seminar, charity gala, party or trade show.

"
6 march 2017,gemini,"Making progress toward long term goals gets a boost today from an important Sun-Mercury meeting. The entire week is peppered with good aspects, so reach out to decision makers, mentors or people who can help you on your journey. It’s also a smart time to strategize and plan your next steps.

"
7 march 2017,gemini,"Landing a raise, new job or increasing your company’ s revenues are all in the stars for you this week. The only issue today is that you could be too emotional about money, not a good thing if you’re negotiating or considering your options. Don’t sell out or settle for less than you deserve.

"
8 march 2017,gemini,"If you’ve been feeling like a ship on a stormy sea, being tossed around by other people’s attitudes and agendas, you can put a stop to this today—no drama necessary. It’s a matter of owning your power, stepping into it. With intelligent Mercury and the Sun both in your house of authority, you can do so with ease.

"
9 march 2017,gemini,"The planets are setting up a highly cathartic time in which you can release drama and unpleasant memories of the past, Gemini. Energetic Mars moves into your twelfth house of nurturing and healing today, to be followed by a full moon next Sunday in your comfort-driven fourth house. It’s important over the next six weeks to dig down and uncover what personal work needs to be done, especially when it comes to family and love-related issues.

"
10 march 2017,gemini,"The lines of communication open up nicely, not only in romance but in business affairs. You may need to become more involved or authoritative in these matters, standing up for yourself or being the agent of change. The time is now, as Sunday’s full moon falls in your house of feeling emotionally secure and content.

"
11 march 2017,gemini,"With the Sun in the career sector of your chart, this is one of your best times all year to advance. And with lucky, profitable Jupiter in your house of skill and creativity, you have the ability to wow decision makers. But make sure that your skill set is up to snuff. Do you need to take a course, read a book or study with a mentor to become more valuable? Consider new avenues and possibilities.

"
12 march 2017,gemini,"“When you think everything is someone else’s fault, you will suffer a lot. When you realize that everything springs only from yourself, you will learn peace and joy.” This quote from the Dalai Lama sums up the message behind today’s full moon, Gemini. It falls in your house of contentment and emotional security. Even if the people around you are not at peace, you can still learn to remain serene.

"
13 march 2017,gemini,"Time to make some new friends? Now that chatty Mercury is in your house of camaraderie along with Venus, it will be easy to expand your social circle. Volunteer and charitable activities are also favored, so if you want to give back to the community, the animal kingdom or planet Earth now’s a great time to help make a difference.

"
14 march 2017,gemini,"Reality check! You could be so passionate about your beliefs or a project that you simply can’t fathom why others wouldn’t be thrilled with them too. This goes for love, work and friendship. Don’t be surprised if someone laughs at your ideas, calling them impossible or unrealistic. But they’re not, so keep on truckin’.

"
15 march 2017,gemini,"The Sun will be blazing a path through your ambition sector for six more days, and you may already be feeling a bit wiped out from the activity of the last few weeks. Today a healing lunar aspect suggests that you slow down and take a mental health day–or hour! Consider a massage, a yummy home cooked meal, or a night alone with a glass of wine and a good book.

"
16 march 2017,gemini,"Inspiration flows with a stimulating Moon-Neptune connection! While this will help you dream up more innovative solutions at the workplace, you can also use this energy to redecorate a room at home, sculpt your body into a work of art or dive into hobbies that will make your heart sing. Considering that the Sun is about to enter your house of friendship you should buddy up with a pal as you take on new challenges.

"
17 march 2017,gemini,"You may have to tiptoe around a partner over the next few days as a tense angle in the heavens warns against coming on too strong. You’re in quite an authoritative position these days, thanks to the Sun in the most ambitious part of your chart. However, a romantic or business partner may not share your vision, nor your enthusiasm level. You can try forcing your agenda down their throat (which will backfire) or you can wait until next week when working as a team becomes easier.

"
18 march 2017,gemini,"What a weekend to have some fun with the tribe! Chatty, sociable Mercury meets up with magnetic Venus in your house of camaraderie, so schedule cocktails, brunch or a shopping spree. Don’t be surprised, oh single Geminis, if a friend tries to set you up with someone. Even if your pals are busy for the weekend singles should get out there and network, as this is prime time for meeting someone new.

"
19 march 2017,gemini,"Your relationships with people are the focus of the cosmos over the next two weeks. Today, serious Saturn asks you to examine close business and romantic ties. Are you coming from the same place? Once the Sun enters Aries tomorrow you’ll be meeting new people, some of whom will be in your life for years to come. Is it time to cut some old ties in order to create new ones?

"
20 march 2017,gemini,"Working closely with other people will become quite important over the next four weeks, Gemini. The Sun glides into Aries today, your eleventh house of camaraderie and networking. You’ll be able to make some new friends, get involved in charity work and perhaps be asked to join a cutting edge team at work. It won’t be easy going everyday, however; you’ll experience times when you have to suck it up and cooperate with people who are difficult. But the end result will be worth it.

"
21 march 2017,gemini,"You could encounter some kind of friction today, especially in the area of personal relationships. Someone may be trying to make you feel guilty or push your buttons, which could really make you emotional. With the Moon in the part of your chart that governs your psychological depth, though, you also have the opportunity to see this for what it is—then let it go.

"
22 march 2017,gemini,"If you need to get something off your chest today is a good time to do so. The planets are acting up tomorrow and Friday, so either speak now or hold your piece until next week. Friends can be a good source of solace and advice today, and then again at the time of the new moon on the 28th.

"
23 march 2017,gemini,"Watch out for the green-eyed monster, especially among your friends or colleagues—or within you! Envying other people for what appears to be their “fabulous life” won’t help improve your own. If you’re at the receiving end of someone’s jealousy (and the remarks and looks that may come with it), let it go. And get used to it. You have more good stuff coming your way and you deserve to enjoy it.

"
24 march 2017,gemini,"Optimism can be a beautiful thing. After all, would you rather be around a gloomy pessimist or someone who’s looking at the brighter side of life? But the planets may shake your optimism with a tense Jupiter-Mercury square. This could be most apparent in the areas of love and friendship. You may start to question an alliance, wondering if it’s secure or if you want to remain in it. The new moon next Tuesday will help you get a clearer picture.

"
25 march 2017,gemini,"The people you know—as well as the people you haven’t met yet—are going to play a big part in your life in the weeks ahead, Gemini. Be open to making new acquaintances and business contacts. Consider joining some kind of a team, whether it’s a golf league, charity or industry think tank. Today is perfect for mingling—especially if you’re looking for love!

"
26 march 2017,gemini,"Your career can get a big jolt forward thanks to two terrific aspects in the heavens. The first one encourages you to join forces with others as collaborations are your key to future success. If you’re not part of a team at the office, is there one you can join? If not (or the people aren’t cutting edge thinkers) is there an industry meeting or group you can attend? The second aspect, a Mars-Neptune sextile, tells you that inspiration can flow your way with (yes, I’m serious) meditation. Hey, that’s how Jack Canfield came up with the name for his book, Chicken Soup for the Soul.

"
27 march 2017,gemini,"Got love on your mind? You should be considering that the emotional Moon is sidled up next to romantic Venus in the heavens. If you’re looking for amour, head out to where people gather: a party, seminar, book signing, industry event or convention. This is the most auspicious way to land a new mate. Attached? Then start planning more nights out instead of in, and go the group route instead of just the two of you. There is quite a convivial air encouraging you to mingle.

"
28 march 2017,gemini,"A much more social season swings into place for you Gemini, thanks to the new moon in the most outgoing part of your chart. The next six months are no time to sit at home in front of the TV. Get out there and network, as the connections you make will play big part in your overall happiness level and success. A pal could play matchmaker or tip you off about a job. Becoming part of a volunteer effort will bring gratification. Hanging out with people who share your hobbies and interests can be a heck of a lot of fun. What are you waiting for?

"
29 march 2017,gemini,"Teaming up with others can really work in your favor over the next few weeks and months, thanks to yesterday’s new moon in your networking sector. A superb Mercury-Saturn trine today tells you to start reaching out to others. This could be for a neighborhood association, charity, planning a family reunion, creating an industry think tank or any other purpose. While the road ahead won’t be completely smooth, you’ll still travel farther if you take others with you on your journey.

"
30 march 2017,gemini,"Power struggles may erupt within a romantic relationship or some kind of work project. It appears from your chart that the overall direction that things are heading in is a point of contention. Not only that, someone may try to grab the reins and take control—which will only lead to more problems. To be honest, the power player could be you, so think twice before you start pushing others around.

"
31 march 2017,gemini,"Dig deep, Gemini! Intelligent Mercury enters the house that governs your subconscious mind, joining energetic Mars. This is one heck of a time to take out the toxic trash and replace it with more positive thought patterns, not to mention getting in touch with a deeper, more metaphysical side of yourself. Your artistic talents can also flow as the doors to your skill base open up wide.

"
1 april 2017,gemini,"Do you truly love what you do for a living? If not, you’re about to get a wakeup call as Venus begins to backslide into your career house tomorrow. The good news is that this will give you the opportunity to get in touch with your true self, the wise voice that knows what will make your heart sing. Consider your options between the 2nd and the 15th, then get ready to make changes mid-April.

"
2 april 2017,gemini,"A little shameless self-promotion could go a long way between now and the middle of the month. With Magnetic Venus sliding backward into your career and goals sector today, reach out to decision makers and toot your own horn. Sometimes people need a reminder as to just how talented you are. Give them a gentle wakeup call.

"
3 april 2017,gemini,"Got a great idea? Then showcase it—to a boss, client, investor or any other key decision maker. But the planets suggest that you fly solo on this venture. If you try to work with a group, you might be dealing with idea-stealers or malcontents who won’t play nice. You’re the one with the smarts: use that to your  advantage, not someone else’s.

"
4 april 2017,gemini,"The green eyed monster might raise its jealous little head today with a Moon-Saturn square. Envy may take hold as you eye a friend who seems to have it all; or perhaps a pal is giving you the resentful looks! But not to worry. Next week’s full moon will help you close out this chapter and enjoy life a heck of a lot more.

"
5 april 2017,gemini,"If you need to discuss something with a boss or key client, now’s the time to do so. A helpful Moon- Neptune aspect is suitable for getting things out there. Planetary influences indicate that you may need to switch up the manner in which you communicate, though, so keep this in mind. Perhaps you need to be more direct or creative. Maybe you should aspire to be more diplomatic. Try new approaches until you get it right.

"
6 april 2017,gemini,"Let’s get serious! That may be your battle cry as Saturn retrogrades in your sector of partnering up. This includes romantic alliances as well as business ones. Would your career benefit from hiring an agent, manager or stylist? Is it time to stop dating divas and bad boys and finally settle down? Maybe you need to hold some mature convos with an existing partner. Between now and September you can solidify your union.

"
7 april 2017,gemini,"Just how badly do you want to fit in—with the crowd, your family, a relationship? Giving up your own sense of individuality may exact a price from you, Gemini. There is no shortage of people around you who would prefer it if you did things their way. Indeed, you may even feel envious of them. But think before you commit to following someone else’s path.

"
8 april 2017,gemini,"If you feel as though others are clipping your wings, you can blame it on two stinky squares today that pit you against close connections. From your chart it appears that people in your world (friends, co-workers, a lover) are putting their own needs first, to the point where you are feeling burdened by their demands. Diplomatically extracting yourself from the situation may be tricky, but it could also be the best way to maintain your sanity and serenity.

"
9 april 2017,gemini,"Who’s got your back? Chances are you’ll find out, now that Mercury is in your house of secrets and hidden matters. Between now and the 20th you’ll need to rely on logic just as much as your gut, as Mercury’s retro spin could create fuzzy thinking. Friends and lovers will be in the spotlight over the next week. Make sure that you share the same values and that you’re in agreement over key issues.

"
10 april 2017,gemini,"Someone close may be burdened with a problem and could look to you for help. While they may not take your advice seriously right now, you’ve done your part by listening and providing them with input. Your words will make sense to them later this month.

"
11 april 2017,gemini,"Your emotions could be flowing like wine thanks to the full moon in the dramatic fifth house of romance and living la vida loca. Problem is, they could flow a bit too much thanks to a Jupiter-Pluto square. Don’t assume that everyone around you, which includes friends as well as a lover, is on the same page as you. If you allow your feelings to show too much there could be repercussions. Wait until the weekend for a more rational time to express your ideas and feelings.

"
12 april 2017,gemini,"With inspirational Neptune in your house of ambition, you should have no shortage of bright ideas. But watch that you don’t get carried away with them or take on too many new projects at once. You’ll soon realize that you’ve overlooked some details or that you need more information before you can charge forward.

"
13 april 2017,gemini,"Playing by the rules may not always be fun but cutting corners–and then dealing with the subsequent fallout–is far worse. Stick to protocols and mind the fine points. Your life is about to become busier with new projects and activities. Make sure the things you’re already working on are all buttoned up.

"
14 april 2017,gemini,"Absolute genius! Uranus, the planet of innovation and brainstorms, is sparking some pretty awesome thoughts in your mind. Not only that, a strong angle to the Sun indicates that you’ll have the mojo to act on them too. Right now your best bet is to find like minded people to make things happen rather than flying solo. Seek a mentor, attend a seminar or buddy up with folks who are forward thinkers too.

"
15 april 2017,gemini,"Finding common ground with the people closest to you should get easier now that Venus has stationed direct. For the past month it’s been retrograde, creating confusion in love or career matters. You may have been unsure which direction to head in while friction existed with others. Now you can create forward momentum, although once the Sun enters Taurus next week you may decide to work on some projects by yourself.

"
16 april 2017,gemini,"Confidence is sexy, and you should be showing off what you’ve got! Lusty Mars and charismatic Venus meet in the heavens, encouraging you to put your best foot forward. This is true not only in romance but your career and other ambitions as well. Just be sure to maintain a little mystery about you considering that Mars is in the hush-hush house of seclusion.

"
17 april 2017,gemini,"Where is this relationship going? Serious talks can take place as two of the most straightforward orbs in the solar system meet up in a helpful trine. The Sun and Saturn are determined to bring longevity to a union, whether it’s a business relationship or a romantic one. But don’t rush things. With the Sun about to enter the most secluded part of your chart, you need time to think things over.

"
18 april 2017,gemini,"Start taking more control over your financial situation rather than letting others run the show, or worse….the fickle hand of fate! Consider yourself as the captain of the good ship Lots o’  Wealth, and steer that vessel down the best channel for pocketing more money. Whether you should go the safe route or take a risk is to early to tell. When Pluto retrogrades in this sector on Thursday, you’ll have through late September to figure things out.

"
19 april 2017,gemini,"Of all the signs of the zodiac you will be the most reflective over the next four weeks, Gemini. In part it’s due to the Sun moving into the most secluded, quiet part of your chart, the place where you heal old wounds and release the past. But Pluto and Mercury retrograde the next day, adding to this sense of cocooning. Your closest relationships, with a lover and friends, will be the focus.

"
20 april 2017,gemini,"Sometimes you just gotta let the past go, and now is one of those times. Old hurts, feelings of resentment, jealousy and grudges need to be 86’d as Pluto retrogrades in one of the deepest, most emotional parts of your chart. It will be back stroking through the heavens until late September, so take this valuable time to process your feelings. It’s not always easy to do this kind of mental cleansing but the results will be worth it. Meditation, spending more time in nature and learning more about different philosophies (such as Buddhism or Tao) could be enormously helpful.

"
21 april 2017,gemini,"Woo-hoo! Energetic, lusty Mars is now in Gemini, a place it hasn’t visited in two years. You can move mountains over the next few months, going after just about any goal or passion that’s on your mind. But with four planets retrograde—three of which are in houses that deal with the people closest to you—you may face resistance from them. Or, you might hold back out of fear; “what will they think?” This is your time, Gemini. You’ll be able to get people on your side after Venus changes signs on the 28th.

"
22 april 2017,gemini,"Trying to sweet talk someone into doing what you want will backfire today, so don’t even think about it. If you need to get your point across—to a child, boss, lover or family member—your best bet is to be as straightforward as possible. Back up your statements with facts, not emotions, and let time pass so that your words have the chance to sink in. Next week is a much better time to push your agenda.

"
23 april 2017,gemini,"Confidence is sexy and you should be brimming with it today, Gemini! A sexy meet up of Venus and the Moon in the take-charge part of your chart takes you from being a wallflower to a hothouse orchid. And with red hot, lusty Mars now in your sign, your charisma factor is high. Work it, honey.

"
24 april 2017,gemini,"Two heads are better than one! Teaming up with a other individual (or a group) is the best way to make progress these days. The cosmos is urging you to consider the benefits of forming an alliance–to help make improvements in your neighborhood or school, to take your business revenues to a higher level, or to gain the expert advice of a mentor on any topic of your choosing. Talks that start today will continue into next week. All that counts today is to get the ball rolling.

"
25 april 2017,gemini,"A major chapter of your life is about to close in a good way, thanks to the upcoming new moon in your house of endings and renewal. A sudden realization may hit you that you need to revise your game plan for the year ahead, as some of your goals or dreams have changed. Over the next few weeks you’ll be able to really get clear as to what you want to manifest, and who will be traveling with you on this journey.

"
26 april 2017,gemini,"Heal thyself! The new moon in your cathartic twelfth house urges you to start taking better care of your tired body and mind. Set appointments to talk with health care professionals, such as a doctor, nutritionist or physical therapist. The same holds true for counselors who can assist you in eliminating past traumas or bad habits that have been difficult to release. With Venus about to enter your house of connecting with others, this isn’t a journey that you’ll be traveling solo. Hook up with an exercise buddy, join a bereavement group or head to a metaphysical shop to learn how to become more mindful.

"
27 april 2017,gemini,"Intense emotions may be bubbling to the surface of your psyche thanks to yesterday’s new moon, and today is a good time to start dealing with them. Specifically, how you handle your own personal power—and threats to it—are the focus. So where are you giving your power away, or to whom? Bad habits? Getting manipulated by a lover or family members? Falling prey to workplace negativity? Identify, then make changes.

"
28 april 2017,gemini,"Group dynamics begin to shift as easy going Venus enters this sector, its second visit here this year. And it may not be because other people are changing. You  may become more tolerant of co-workers, friends or others who are on your team, such as a volunteer group. The recent new moon fell in your psychological sector, imbuing you with wisdom. Sometimes it’s best to not engage in the theatrics that others want to stir up.

"
29 april 2017,gemini,"You may be reminded about your obligations to other people this weekend, something that may not sit well with you. With the Moon in Gemini you just want to have some down time for yourself. It may have to wait a few days, but fear not—the recent new moon in Taurus was custom made for doing some pampering and relaxing. Book an appointment for a massage or another self-indulgent session for later next week.

"
30 april 2017,gemini,"One door closes, another opens as the recent new moon fell in your house of closure. The next few months are excellent for bringing positive new circumstances into your life, which includes earning more. A stellar Moon-Sun aspect today can help you brainstorm or research ideas that may be percolating in your brain. Don’t dismiss them; they could be winners.

"
1 may 2017,gemini,"Someone in your circle, whether it’s a friend or a co-worker, could act out in a way that catches you off guard. Mercury has been retrograde in your house of networking for some time now, so you may already have witnessed some wonky behavior from someone. Your best bet is to let it pass. Mercury resumes direct motion on Wednesday, at which time you’ll be able to speak with them in a more rational manner.

"
2 may 2017,gemini,"Charisma and magnetism: you’ve got ‘em in spades, Gemini, thanks to red hot Mars in your sign! Use that charm to win people over today—a lover, potential client, new boss, banker, neighbor, family member, you name it. Mars forms a sparkling aspect with the Moon in gregarious Leo, permitting you to sell ice cream to Eskimos.

"
3 may 2017,gemini,"It’s 5 o’clock somewhere! Which means that it’s time for cocktails, networking, a little gossip, planning world domination and all of the other things that go on when folks get together. Chatty little Mercury goes direct in your social eleventh house of networking, helping you schmooze with business contacts, friends and lovers (and those potential mates in your crosshairs). Get out there and enjoy it, because some of these connections will take you far.

"
4 may 2017,gemini,"Your dreams of a happy home life may hit a few snags as Venus asks you to revise some of your plans. Perhaps you have to hold off on conceiving a baby, at least until you save more money. The same situation may ring true for a house purchase. A parent may need your help, pulling you away from your kids or personal time that you’d like to enjoy. June is a much better month for moving forward with your plans.

"
5 may 2017,gemini,"What do you really expect from a love partner or from romance in general, Gemini? That’s the question the cosmos poses to you today. Are you waiting for someone to rescue you? Are you letting fears and disappointment from the past color your current view? Harboring a crush on someone who’s unavailable? Get real and come to terms with any unrealistic terms or attitudes you may be holding on to.

"
6 may 2017,gemini,"If you need more emotional support from the people closest to you, by all means let them know. The Sun is in the most healing part of your chart, encouraging you to release negativity. This includes the demands and expectations placed upon you by loved ones. It’s a two-way street, Gemini. Just as they have needs so do you.

"
7 may 2017,gemini,"Inspirational Neptune is in a good mood, telling you to take a more creative approach to life. Your mind might immediately go to the way you dress or wear your hair, maybe your home decor or the dishes you cook. But it’s more than that. This also includes your occupation and the way you go about your business day. Start thinking out of the box.

"
8 may 2017,gemini,"There’s a lot of planetary activity this week in the part of your chart that deals with your most cherished dreams, and today they will be in sharp focus. The issue at hand is that what you  want and what other people may have in mind are two different things. Another problem may be jealousy on your part, as you eye the goodies that other people have and demand to know when the hell it’s going to be your turn. Well, tomorrow maybe, as a super Sun-Pluto aspect puts you in the driver’s seat.

"
9 may 2017,gemini,"An interesting day lies ahead as two of the most powerful orbs in our solar system, the Sun and Pluto, form a terrific aspect in the make-your-dreams-a reality sectors. This is a very mental vibe, encouraging you to think deeply about what you want. Furthermore, what negative emotions or situations do you need to clear out before you can move ahead? The full moon on Wednesday takes you from the thinking stage to the planning stage.

"
11 may 2017,gemini,"Collaborations with others may be the best way to increase your net worth, Gemini. A spontaneous meeting of intelligent Mercury and brilliant Uranus could bring in people who want to work with you, and from the looks of your chart some serious money could be made. Likewise, you may be interested in finding a mentor, coach or partner whose expertise could help take yours to a higher level. With the Sun in the most secretive part of your chart, though, be sure to keep convos on the downlow.

"
12 may 2017,gemini,"Yee-ha! Looks like Gemini is ready to have some fun, and we’re not talking about the usual stuff. Hell no, energetic Mars trines optimistic Jupiter, pushing you to bust out of an old groove and seize control of your future. For what it’s worth Jupiter is in your house of romance, art, culture, sports and living la vida loca. If you’ve got a mental list of things you intend to do “someday”….well Skippy, someday is here. What are you waiting for?

"
13 may 2017,gemini,"Your ideas about what makes for long term success and happiness in love may be changing, Gemini. Maybe you realize that you’re perfectly happy just living with someone and you don’t need to marry. Perhaps your tastes are evolving, and your ideal mate is a completely different type than before. It may hit you that you don’t have to put up with certain behaviors, and that you’re done  with drama. Maybe a less flashy and more soulful mate is the best person for you. There is great wisdom in that mind of yours, Gemini—tap into it.

"
14 may 2017,gemini,"If you’ve felt stuck, unable to find the solution to an issue that has been on your mind, help is on the way. Intelligent Mercury will enter the intuitive part of your chart on Tuesday for a three-week stay, so you can expect some innovative breakthroughs to come your way. But today has excellent aspects that can help you too, especially in matters of the heart and career. The key word these days is “creativity”. If you do things the same way you’ve always done them, you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.

"
15 may 2017,gemini,"Ggrrrr!  Someone’s feeling frisky. A sexy meet up of the amorous Moon and subterranean Pluto will fire up not only your libido, but your desire to bond with another on a more intimate mental level too. And when Pluto is around, you won’t be interested in settling for table scraps in the boudoir or your love life, if you get my drift. So make some demands. Chains and whips optional.

"
16 may 2017,gemini,"An important transition time begins today as brainy Mercury enters one of the most reflective parts of your chart, where it will remain for a few weeks. Yes, your birthday season is almost here but with Mercury in this sector you should do some quiet thinking about your life before heading down a new path. This is a time for rest, solitude and even meditation. Balancing your rational mind with intuitive vibes may be a bit of a challenge, but it’s important to pay attention to both.

"
17 may 2017,gemini,"The Moon in friendly Aquarius is pleading with you to make things right with a lover or your kids, or even co-workers with whom you’re experiencing “creative differences”. Considering that La Luna is forming a super angle with lucky Jupiter, you should have no problem. It’s important to do this now, because Friday brings a difficult aspect in which your needs and ideas will be pitted against theirs.

"
18 may 2017,gemini,"Feel like finding a cabin in the woods a la  Henry Thoreau and hiding out for awhile? It wouldn’t be surprising if you did. A tense Venus-Jupiter aspect could find friends and lovers determined to push your buttons, to the point where you say, “Enough!”. Maybe pals are meddling in your love life. Perhaps one of these folks is jealous or demanding. If you need some down time, take it. The new moon next week is in your sign, putting your needs first.

"
19 may 2017,gemini,"Every once in a while the cosmos sends up an aspect that is designed to shake up our view about a situation, and today is one of those days. Rule breaker Uranus challenges tried-and-true Saturn (in a nice way, mind you!), asking you to rethink the “rules” that you may have concerning friends and lovers. Are you too particular—or way too flexible, letting anyone  into your life? In love, are you doggedly pursuing a type, not willing to bend from that ideal? Maybe you need to socialize more, or get involved in a charitable organization. This aspect repeats again in November, so get ready—your opinions about people are going to change dramatically.

"
20 may 2017,gemini,"Walk over to the mirror and kiss yourself on the lips, Gemini—your birthday season is officially here! This year will be different from 2016 in that red hot Mars, the ambitious planet that knows how to get things done, is also in your sign right now. The good news is that this can make you unstoppable; the downside is that you may become so  anxious to see progress that you’ll mow people over or burn out from exertion. So slow your roll, but not too much: the new moon next Thursday is the perfect time to kick off your plans.

"
21 may 2017,gemini,"Teaming up with new people is a strong possibility this week, and the cosmos urges you to get out there and mingle. Today and tomorrow are super for schmoozing, whether you’re trying to meet a soulmate, find a new job or meet parents in the neighborhood who have kids the same age as yours. The new moon in Gemini on Thursday opens up all sorts of possibilities for you, so it makes sense to have other people along on your journey.

"
22 may 2017,gemini,"Your friends will count for a lot over the next week, Gemini, perhaps even more than a lover or family. Today’s a good time to reach out to a trusted confidante if you need to unload or just relax and unwind. This holds true for talking to a mentor or a wise person who can help you with business matters. In the end you’ll have to make your own decisions, but that should be easy with a new moon in your sign this Thursday.

"
23 may 2017,gemini,"With Thursday’s new moon falling in your  sign, birthday girl or guy, you may be feeling mighty ambitious. And so you should! This annual event is the cosmos’s gift to you to start over. But you need to take your time, as a stern Saturn-Mars opposition could be making you over anxious. This planetary energy is building and reaches its most powerful level on the 29th. So take a deep breath, count to ten, and plot the year ahead. Think “tortoise” instead of “hare”.

"
24 may 2017,gemini,"Hush! Don’t spill secrets today or confide in people whom you’re not 100% sure have your back. According to the planets there are some interesting things going on in your life, and a happy lunar aspect encourages you to go after them. But a brewing Venus-Pluto square warns against sharing too much. Even if your friends or colleagues feel as though they are entitled  to hear the scoop, that’s not the case. You don’t owe them anything.

"
25 may 2017,gemini,"The cosmos delivers your annual birthday gift: a glittering new moon in your sign! Over the next six months you can make a lot of progress with dreams that are important to you. However, make sure that your dreams are just that: yours.  Chasing after goals to keep up with your friends, or to have the most happening Facebook page isn’t what it’s all about. Be true to yourself.

"
26 may 2017,gemini,"Relationships with others may have been tricky lately, especially with friends, colleagues and team members. With sweet Venus in your camaraderie sector you may end up being the peace maker, whether you want to or not! Your powers of persuasion are excellent with assertive Mars in your chatty third house. Next Tuesday is an excellent day to get everyone back on the same team—or page.

"
27 may 2017,gemini,"The recent new moon in your sign opens up a two-week window in which you can really get clear on what you’d like to achieve. If you apply yourself over the next six months progress can be made. This weekend is super for talking to friends who can act as a sounding board for your ideas. Finding a mentor who is savvy about the areas you want to go into is a smart move too. Why reinvent the wheel when someone can tell you how to get things done more quickly?

"
28 may 2017,gemini,"Some “hidden” information could come your way over the next few days that will put you in an advantageous situation. It could be a scoop that someone confides or maybe a gut feeling that you have, but either way you stand to benefit from it. Take your time before you act, as there should be more tidbits of information coming your way over the next week.

"
29 may 2017,gemini,"Slow your roll, Gemini! Impatient Mars has been in your sign for some time now, making you determined to get things done. But don’t move so quickly that you make a major mistake, quite the possibility these days as mature and logical Saturn opposes Mars. It’s also possible that someone close may be making you feel hemmed in, and if that’s the case, you may need to put some space between the two of you.

"
30 may 2017,gemini,"Megawatt Mars is in your house of self, which not deals with your image but also some of the big plans you’d like to kick off over this new birthday year. Problem is, you may be going in too many directions, unsure which options to pick or whether you have the chops to pull them off. An unexpected meeting or conversation with someone could be just the remedy, as the cosmos is trying to help you connect with a mentor or friend with sage advice.

"
31 may 2017,gemini,"Listening to your inner voice is the way to go as intelligent Mercury is in your house of hidden wisdom. Sometimes you need to clear out some mental cobwebs before you can hear the truth and power that’s tucked away, but with strong man Pluto helping you out, you should have no problem.

"
1 june 2017,gemini,"You’re a friendly sign by nature, and with so much planetary activity in the interpersonal parts of your chart you should be even more of a social butterfly these days. A rockin’ Saturn aspect could bring in new faces that could be in your life for years to come— a potential lover, new pal or business colleagues. Better yet is that your ties with existing people can become even stronger. A friend could suggest entering into a business partnership, for example, or a person who’s just been an acquaintance could become a close confidante.

"
1 june 2016,gemini,"The Sun in your sign is firing you up to go after big dreams and passion projects, but today you come up against some opposition from someone who wants to wear the pants. It could be a boss, a lover, a parent or colleague who’s trying to pull rank, but either way, they may try to stand in your way. Problem is, they may play the passive-aggressive game and you won’t be sure what to believe. Keep calm and carry on. Mercury in your house of intuition will help you separate the BS from reality.

"
2 june 2017,gemini,"Yeah, baby! The sparkling Sun winks at happy-go-lucky Jupiter in what should be one go the most upbeat days of the year. This is a super aspect for finding new love, developing a deeper bond with your amour or conceiving a baby. But there’s another side to this aspect, and that’s really going within and becoming the most authentic “you” possible. Dare to be more creative in the way you approach life.

"
2 june 2016,gemini,"Inspiration is heading your way, Gemini, and you can thank the Moon and Neptune for any bright ideas that pop into your mind! They are determined to help you find solutions to career issues especially. Got a problem client you need to calm down? Working on a new product line and feel stymied by the slow progress? Writing a book or a screenplay? Get ready for forward momentum.

"
3 june 2017,gemini,"Sudden changes could occur with close connections as erratic Uranus creates minor earthquakes. There are two sides to this: your lover takes you away for the weekend on an unplanned romantic holiday. A friend matches you up with a soulful new potential mate. An old friend calls and suggests drinks, someone you haven’t heard from in ages. But on the flip side, you realize you’ve had enough go a frenemy’s behavior and cut the cord. A lover won’t commit to the same long term plans as you and you realize that a decision needs to be made. Wait until Mercury enters your sign on Tuesday to make a decision.

"
4 june 2017,gemini,"I want, I want! That’s the new battle cry as assertive Mars barrels into your money and security conscious second house. Building income streams and padding your savings account could be the result if you take this energy and work with it wisely. Gaining more guarantees about a romantic union is also in the stars. However, don’t be so impatient to get ahead that you enter into risky financial ventures or spend too much. Likewise, don’t push a lover into making decisions just because your clock is ticking like an atomic bomb ready to detonate.

"
5 june 2017,gemini,"You may need to step back from your goals and dreams today for a reality check. From your chart it appears that your mind is adrift at sea with unrealistic deadlines or strategies that aren’t fully fleshed out. You may also be indulging in fantasies, so it’s time to snap out of it. When Venus enters the house of your subconscious mind tomorrow you’ll be able to intuit the next best step.

"
6 june 2017,gemini,"Slow your roll, Gemini! Magnetic Venus, planet of ease, is urging you to take things one moment at a time. It’s called mindfulness, and you can benefit enormously by learning more about it. No matter how much you worry and fret, things will unfold at their own pace. Fortunately practical Mercury enters your sign today, helping you see situations and people for what they are.

"
7 june 2017,gemini,"It’s been your birthday season for some time now, but today the cosmos delivers a nice gift in your lap: the movement of Mercury into Gemini. If you’ve been holding back from expressing your feelings or ideas, now’s the time to speak up. Mercury is the planet of rational thought and strategic planning, but that’s not the only trick you have up your sleeve. Yesterday Venus entered your house of intuition, so between your brain and your gut there will be no shortage of inspiration and wisdom.

"
8 june 2017,gemini,"Creativity can’t be rushed or forced, Gemini. The right side of our brain, the place that allows talent to flow, likes to operate without a sense of time and watching the clock. You’re in a superb spot today to readjust the way you’re going about a project that requires a good deal of inspiration. A sparkling Jupiter-Neptune aspect bodes well for this, whether you’re redecorating the living room, writing a manuscript or developing your brand.

"
9 june 2017,gemini,"Wow! It’s a big day for Geminis as there are not one, but two positive aspects that heat up your love life. First, Jupiter resumes direct motion in your fifth house of romance. Finding new love or spending more time with your amour are all possible now after a four-month slowdown. Better yet, there’s a full moon in your commitment sector, indicating that many Geminis are more than ready to take the next big step. With serious, mature Saturn in a good angle your decisions should be sound.

"
10 june 2017,gemini,"Life should start looking a lot more pleasant now that abundant, optimistic Jupiter is moving direct in your house of enjoying life’s goodies (which includes love, dontcha know). This house is also the sector of creativity, so if you’re in a line of work (or want to be) that’s on the more artistic side, you have between now and October 10th to really log some studio time and make your mark. But this also includes getting back in touch with hobbies or sports that you used to enjoy, as well as diving in to new ones.

"
11 june 2017,gemini,"It’s a good day to team up with others as spontaneous Uranus is active in your house of friends and networking. Go out to brunch with the tribe, plan a golf game, go to a hobby convention or get involved with a charity. There’s an air of the unexpected happening today; who knows whom you might meet!

"
12 june 2017,gemini,"Getting on the same page with others, especially when it comes to a creative direction, becomes easy today thanks to a helpful Mercury-Jupiter trine. This could mean agreeing with your spouse about redecorating the living room or creating a baby together. A team at the office may put aside their squabbling and approve the way a project should be handled. Creatives can really come up with some terrific new ideas to pursue. Inspiration is running high, so roll with it.

"
13 june 2017,gemini,"Feel like you’re getting the runaround from someone in a position of authority? It could be, courtesy of a stinky Neptune-Mercury square. Don’t expect the boss, government officials or a judge to provide clarity today: it may be just the opposite. Wait a bit, but not too long—Neptune retrogrades on Friday. Try to get an answer before then.

"
14 june 2017,gemini,"Try to discuss long term plans or important issues with a lover or business partner today, if all possible. A difficult Sun-Saturn opposition tomorrow could make you feel as though your needs aren’t being met—which is why you need to voice your opinion right now.

"
15 june 2017,gemini,"Is someone else running your life? With the Sun in your sign, Gemini, you should be the captain of your own ship. But if that’s not the case, resentment could build today due to a Sun-Saturn opposition. It’s one thing to be in a partnership, friendship or family relationship, and another to be someone’s doormat. Make sure that your needs are being met.

"
17 june 2017,gemini,"Follow your bliss? If you current gig isn’t making your heart sing, it may be time for a change. A Moon-Chiron aspect tells you that it’s not your karma to stay in a dead end job or an industry that no longer appeals to you. Now that Neptune is retrograde in your ambition sector you can reflect upon what you’d really like to do.

"
18 june 2017,gemini,"An opportunity may arise to join a group or to meet new people, and from your chart it appears that this will seemingly come from out of the blue. With the Sun in your sign your personal magnetism is high, so get ready to network and impress your new contacts–and have a lot of fun in the process.

"
19 june 2017,gemini,"Despite your best efforts to communicate with others, they may be digging in their heels. You have your own principles and they have theirs. The good news is that a surprising breakthrough may occur tomorrow or the next day, so don’t give up–and don’t give in!

"
20 june 2017,gemini,"Habits make the man, so they say, and they also make the woman! With the Sun and Mercury both moving into your rituals sector tomorrow, you’re in a good place to lay down some new routines that will help you live a better life. But from your chart it appears that you could use some expert advice. Well, there’s no shortage of that! Podcasts, self-help books, mentors, websites—dive in and find the guidance you need.

"
21 june 2017,gemini,"Want to see more money in your wallet? Then don’t be shy about it—make the big ask! Verbal Mercury and the authoritative Sun have just glided into your income sector and they make one heck of a dynamic duo. Ask for the order, the business, the job, the raise. Self-employed? Analyze your products or services to see where you can make improvements, or what you can add to your lineup. Take this awesome cosmic energy and run with it.

"
22 june 2017,gemini,"Your self-esteem can get a terrific boost, thanks to the mighty Sun and cheerful Mercury in your second house of worth—which also includes your finances. The next few weeks are favorable for pulling your life together in many ways, from creating better habits to seeking more stable relationships with others.

"
23 june 2017,gemini,"It’s time to talk turkey. With the passionate Moon swinging past the authoritative Sun and shrewd Mercury, now’s the time to go after more cash. Even if you’re not ready to ask for a raise, a big order or for the business, at least you should be thinking about how to make things happen.

"
24 june 2017,gemini,"My, my, your financial prospects are looking mighty fine. In astrology there are two houses that govern your income and net worth: the second and eighth houses, respectively. It just so happens that there’s a new moon in the second house of income, making the next six months a superb time to increase your earnings. And powerhouse Pluto is active in your wealth sector, helping you sniff out some possibilities that will bring in big money. Nice!

"
25 june 2017,gemini,"You’ll be in no mood for wishy-washy behavior, empty promises or anything that makes you feel unsettled, Gemini. With three planets in your house of stability, people who bring nothing but drama into your life, or situations that are built on a shaky foundation, will work your nerves pretty quickly. Fortunately the recent new moon was custom made for putting you in a position where you can take charge.

"
26 june 2017,gemini,"The week ahead is awesome for making progress with your career and building a bigger income. A sizzling Mars-Neptune trine today is the perfect aspect for scouting out new opportunities. The only caveat is to take your time before making a decision, as this coming Friday brings an aspect in which you might settle for less than you deserve.

"
26 june 2016,gemini,"It’s a banner day in the cosmos for all signs, as a rare trine occurs between Jupiter and Pluto. This event won’t happen again until 2024, so seize the day! Metamorphic Pluto is in your financial sector, transforming your bottom line so that you can enjoy greater fiscal security. Since Jupiter governs profits, this is an awesome opportunity to do what it takes to earn more passive income: start an online business, develop a product line, invest in rental real estate, or diversify your investments. Carpe diem.

"
27 june 2017,gemini,"Your creativity and ability to problem solve should be at an all time high, thanks to two of the most inspirational planets–Jupiter and Neptune–occupying the houses of talent and ambition. The only trick is how to take your brilliant ideas and make them workable. Tomorrow is one of the best days all year to come up with a smart routine or strategy.

"
27 june 2016,gemini,"Let the inspiration flow! Magnetic Venus and instructive Neptune combine forces to fill your brain with money-making ideas. Profitable Venus just happens to be in your income sector, to be joined later today by Mercury, planet of commerce and negotiation. And let’s-get-things done Mars goes direct in your house of work, bringing in new clients, projects and ideas. Gotta love it!

"
28 june 2017,gemini,"Money talks, and it’s practically screaming today. That’s because motivator Mars is holding a business meeting with shrewd Mercury to discuss the state of your finances. There’s a saying in business: you don’t ask… you don’t get. If earning more dinero is high on your list right now, get out there and make it happen.

"
28 june 2016,gemini,"Your desire for a more peaceful family situation is attainable, Gemini, but some negotiations are necessary with your loved ones. Current planetary angles indicate that you don’t want to settle for less than a happy and fulfilling domestic situation. Finances may be an issue that need to be addressed first. Everyone needs to understand the meaning of the word “budget”.

"
29 june 2017,gemini,"Financial pressure may be building due to a tense Mercury-Pluto opposition, and you may be feeling the strain. The pressure could come from within (your own worries, goals) or from outside (an unexpected expense, a pushy boss who wants you to settle for less). The good news is that super shrewd Mercury can help you find a way out of your situation. Stay more focused on creating a positive outcome than the problem.

"
29 june 2016,gemini,"This could be a fun day full of serendipity, if you’re open to some new experiences! A happy Moon-Uranus conjunction opens up the lines of communication between you and a friend or a group of people. don’t be surprised it you feel the urge to call a pal and make plans, or if you’re at the receiving end of an invitation. There is quite a soulful vibe to this, the ability to bond deeply with another. Enjoy!

"
30 june 2017,gemini,"Love is grand, but sometimes ya just gotta pay the bills and do the laundry. Today is one of those days when despite your desire to live the luxe, romantic life, duty calls. And so does your wallet and bank account.

"
30 june 2016,gemini,"Who’s wearing the pants? That’s the question of the day, as power hungry Pluto in your obsessive eighth house is acting up. You may be getting tired of playing Cinderella, second fiddle, family consigliere or your basic doormat. And you may make your feelings known! What’s so intriguing is that you don’t seem to care, and that your self-esteem is becoming more important to you than playing nice and keeping the peace.

"
1 july 2017,gemini,"Follow your bliss? The planets are telling you to get back into hobbies that you enjoy, spending more time with them so that you fill your soul with contentment. We weren’t put on this planet just to work and run errands. Artistic pursuits, sports and craftsmanship are an essential part of living a rewarding life.

"
1 july 2016,gemini,"Something will happen today that will stir your mind, thinking about the activities and the people that make you feel most content and at ease. Start spending more time with the folks and situations that make your heart sing. You’ll be glad you did.

"
2 july 2017,gemini,"Your finances and net worth will be a big topic this month, Gemini, and today the s*** gets real. Mars may have you inclined to spend, whereas Pluto opposes vehemently opposes this idea. It’s also possible that a spouse doesn’t agree with your money saving ideas, or a new job that you want to take on. The full moon on the 8th will bring this to a head, so be prepared to work through this.

"
2 july 2016,gemini,"Your opinions about what you need to feel secure in a romantic relationship are under review, Gemini, and this is a good thing. Perhaps you realize that you don’t need another person to make you feel whole. Perhaps you discover that a lover is there to add to your enjoyment of life, not to take away from it. Whatever revelations come your way, know that you are growing and changing.

"
3 july 2017,gemini,"With Mars in one of the most structured places of your chart, you’re probably accomplishing more in one day than many people complete in a week. But start to focus on the “significant few” activities rather than the “trivial many.” Otherwise you’ll burn out and stress out from having too much on your plate.

"
3 july 2016,gemini,"You may be ready to take on a new job or cut a business deal, but make sure that you have all the facts. Problem is, foggy Neptune has been retrograde in your career house in recent weeks. But today the Sun helps clarify things by forming a positive angle with the Neptune, burning off that fog. Tomorrow’s new moon will provide more momentum to your advancement.

"
4 july 2017,gemini,"Sweet! Venus glides into Gemini today, making you the “It Girl” or Guy, the one with the smooth moves. Between now and July 31st is the perfect time to pamper yourself, not to mention launching a makeover. With this Friday’s full moon occurring in the sexiest part of your chart, you’re going to be feeling quite physical  these days! Look and feel the part.

"
7 july 2016,gemini,"Digging for the truth! That’s what’s on your agenda as a tough Sun-Pluto opposition makes you question someone else’s motives. And you’d be wise to ask some serious questions, as Pluto’s shadowy side is active. Whether it’s in romance or a financial matter, you’re going to be concerned about protecting your own interests. This isn’t selfish—it’s smart.

"
8 july 2017,gemini,"Are you in, or are you out? Tonight’s full moon can be a turning point in your romantic and financial lives, telling you to cut bait or move upstream. If a romantic union or business alliance has run its course you could abruptly decide to move on.

With long-term Saturn in a good angle, your decisions will have staying power.

"
8 july 2016,gemini,"Home-based businesses are especially favored for you right now, Gemini, thanks to a marvelous Mercury-Jupiter aspect.

Whether it’s your mom, wife, sister, boss, aunt or BFF, the planets are urging you to patch things up. Your emotional security is their focus, and it’s time to release old dramas. This goes for relationships with women who may no longer be on this plane. Forgive, forget, move on.

"
10 july 2016,gemini,"Grounded planetary influences from the Sun and Mercury are encouraging you to find security and contentment at both home and work. If either environment is unstable or chaotic, the cosmos is sending in backup! Optimistic Jupiter is in your domestic sector, and assertive Mars is handling office issues. It’s a good day for making progress on both fronts.

"
11 july 2017,gemini,"Live a little, Gemini! If life has gotten a bit too predictable, then it’s time to shake things up. But do so within a budget as the planets are demanding fiscal responsibility. You don’t have to board a plane and travel to another land to seek adventure; search for it in your own back yard.

"
11 july 2016,gemini,"With the recent new moon and so many planets in your income sector, you’re definitely interested in building more stability with your finances. But a tense square today could bring the realization that a closely held wish may cost more than you had realized. This isn’t the end of the world, however!

"

"
14 july 2016,gemini,"There is no “I” in the word “team” as the corny saying goes, but that message holds true for you today.

"
16 july 2017,gemini,"You’re going to want to ditch your responsibilities and chores today, Gemini, and why not? A spunky Moon-Uranus meet up is telling you to call your friends and plan a beach day, brunch or copious cocktails later on. Your errands can wait.

"
17 july 2016,gemini,"As the Moon enters the most intimate and sensual part of your chart, you could be feeling more in tune with your inner passions and longings.

Tomorrow’s full moon in the emotional bonding part of your chart may create a make or break situation.

"
19 july 2017,gemini,"Wrap up financial negotiations, job hunts or polishing up your resume. This is red hot Mars’s last day in your income and savings sector, so take advantage of it. When it moves into Leo tomorrow you can still make progress, but a lot more self-promotion will be required.

"
19 july 2016,gemini,"Yum! A delicious full moon in your intimacy sector sets the stage for a sexy encounter. You are leaving behind a period of time in which you may have felt as though a deep emotional connection wasn’t possible. That’s about to change! A happy meeting between demonstrative Mercury and steadfast Saturn could bring in love of the truest kind.

"
20 july 2017,gemini,"You’re about to enter one of the most persuasive, productive times you’ve had in years. Mars has just glided into your house of self-expression, thinking and strategizing to be followed by the Sun on Saturday.

"
21 july 2017,gemini,"Now that Mars is in your house of communication and promotion, you’re in an awesome spot to get your message out there.

"
21 july 2016,gemini,"The recent full moon was all about releasing old, worn-out emotions that are no longer serving you, and today you get more help in this area. A positive Moon-Jupiter connection allows you to think beyond previous limiting thoughts. Sometimes we become so focused on security that it becomes a ball and chain rather than a comfort. It’s time to take a little bit of a risk.

"
22 july 2017,gemini,"Get ready for some major brainstorming! The Sun has just joined high-octane Mars in Leo, spiking your brainwaves with brilliant ideas and strategies. Your ability to persuade, negotiate and create valuable synergies with others should be off the charts. Get ready for some shameless self promotion while you’re at it.

"
22 july 2016,gemini,"Tell it like it is! With the Sun in the most communicative part of your chart, the time is right for networking, negotiating and socializing. Express your talents and ideas through a blog, teaching, the graphic arts, joining a local group, or penning a novel. Keeping your good ideas locked up in that brain of yours doesn’t serve anyone!

"
23 july 2017,gemini,"Now that the new moon in Leo has arrived, it’s an auspicious time to get new projects off the ground. The next four weeks are awesome for brainstorming and talking to others, but you may discover than in order to make progress you’ll need to go it alone.

"
23 july 2016,gemini,"Opportunities are out there, Gemini–the key is to find them!

"
24 july 2017,gemini,"If you want to make progress with a person or a team, you’ll need to communicate, of course–but you need to stick up for yourself too. Remain diplomatic but set boundaries at the same time.

"
24 july 2016,gemini,"You’re a natural communicator, and now that the Sun is in the chattiest part of your chart, you should be able to sell ice cream to Eskimos. Not to mention woo your lover, make new friends and write some killer copy. With the Moon now in your networking sector, think about whom you should reach out to this week. Teamwork can take you far.

"
25 july 2017,gemini,"Need to clear the air with a lover or family member? Now that smooth talking Mercury is in your domestic sector, you can work things out. Just be sure to remain diplomatic, as Mars in your communication sector could make you a tad pushy.

"
25 july 2016,gemini,"Think twice before you share your innermost thoughts with an acquaintance or colleague. They don’t need to know everything you’re thinking or planning. As a matter of fact, the planets are suggesting that you create a short list of people you can trust. Not everyone will make the cut.

"
26 july 2017,gemini,"Any fears or concerns that were holding you back from taking action disappear today, thanks to an energetic Sun-Mars meet up. Now is the time to speak your mind, send that text or e-mail, or make a big ask. Just watch the tendency to come on too strong, an issue with megamouth Mars in a feisty mood.

"
26 july 2016,gemini,"You can be a source of inspiration and help to someone close to you, Gemini. Your advice and personal experience qualify you to assist someone else in releasing their own troubles and hurts. The Moon in your house of intuition will give you an added level of insight.

The upcoming weekend is super for socializing, so make your plans now.

"
27 july 2016,gemini,"Getting your point across should be easier than usual today, as a providential Mercury-Uranus trine paves the way.

With the Moon lining up with happy-go-lucky Jupiter in the most creative part of your chart, it’s time to be inspired–by the way you look, the home you live in, the people around you and the kind of work you do. Make that change.

"
29 july 2017,gemini,"Patience is a virtue, Gemini, and you’d be wise to let things take their course. Trying to push others into getting things done your way, or in your time frame, could backfire. Things may actually flow more easily once Venus enters Cancer on Monday.

"
29 july 2016,gemini,"Double whammy! Tech-happy Uranus goes retrograde in the house that governs digital files and electronic equipment. Hmmm…is someone getting too attached to their “toys”? If you break out into a cold sweat if you can’t find your cell phone in under five seconds, or if you’re constantly checking your feed, it may be time to take a hiatus from electronics. You might find that your stress level drops enormously the more you embrace analog.

"
30 july 2017,gemini,"This is Venus’s last day in your sign for awhile, and the golden planet forms a sparkling aspect with surprising Uranus. Which means that you should toss your to-do list for today and do something spontaneous! With Uranus in your house of camaraderie, call a pal or lover and go off on an adventure.

"
30 july 2016,gemini,"The month of September will be a big one for matters involving real estate and family matters, but you can get a head start on these right now. Clever Mercury enters your domestic sector, enabling you to discuss future plans and resolve problems with greater ease. With the Sun in Leo you should start with settling issues with siblings and cousins first, as well as situations in your local neighborhood. If you have any gripes, call the town zoning board and let them know.

"
31 july 2017,gemini,"Start planning your financial future now. Profitable Venus just glided in to your income sector, a place it will be through August 26th. Your current planetary lineup recommends a heck of a lot of self promotion, so do what needs to be done to get your name and reputation out there.

"
31 july 2016,gemini,"Negotiating for a higher salary or trying to close a deal with a client? It may be difficult to reach an agreement due to the opposition between the Moon and Pluto. The other party may seem to be holding all the cards, but sit tight. Inspirational Neptune is working hard behind the scenes to further your ambitions.

"
1 august 2017,gemini,"The “terms” of a partnership may need to be revised and this includes romantic unions as well as business ones. You’re going to want more stability and less drama, and if that means setting some boundaries, new rules or switching your roles, so be it.

"
2 august 2016,gemini,"The urge to merge could become mighty strong, whether for business or pleasure. Dynamic Mars moves into your commitment sector today. Singles will be ready to settle down and couples can enter a more serious phase. And don’t be surprised if someone suggests an alliance that can help further your career. However, don’t wait for these goodies to come your way. With the new moon in your communication house, it’s time to let the world know that you exist!

"
3 august 2017,gemini,"Challenges arise with group endeavors as Uranus begins to retrograde in your house of teamwork! As a result, don’t expect people to do their fair share or to produce on time, whether it’s at home, work or in a volunteer organization. Over the next five months you’ll need to keep a close eye on people–which may mean cracking the whip.

"
3 august 2016,gemini,"A strong Moon-Uranus connection will make you anxious to get big plans under way. The question is: are the people around you ready and willing to commit to your ideas? It could be about anything: buying a house, getting engaged, having a baby or entering into a business partnership for example. With yesterday’s new moon in your talkative third house, you’ll be able to discuss matters with ease.

"
4 august 2017,gemini,"Trying to push a romantic relationship to follow a particular path will backfire today, Gemini, so don’t go there. Don’t demand answers or commitment. Singles, avoid reading too much into what a new flame may have said or done. Coupled up twins need to keep things real too, avoiding drama at all costs.

"
4 august 2016,gemini,"As the Moon and Venus head into Virgo, you’re going to be ready to tackle home-related matters, whether it’s finding a new place to live or fixing up your place. Problem is that a partner may not share your zest for new duvet covers or relocating. It may also be that you can’t agree on how to handle an issue with kids or other family members.

Venus enters your domestic sector today, making you anxious to see forward movement in a romantic relationship: finding a new one, cohabitating, buying a place, starting a family, deeper commitment. But tense angles coming from Mars and Saturn warn that you’re moving too fast. Once Saturn goes direct on the 13th things will develop momentum.

"
6 august 2017,gemini,"Feel like you’re stuck between a rock and a hard place? With the emotional Moon getting battered by Jupiter and Uranus, you may feel that you can’t keep anyone happy. Let it pass. Once the lunar eclipse occurs on Monday, you’ll be far too absorbed in your own exciting plans to worry about other peoples’ agendas.

"
6 august 2016,gemini,"Time out! It may be necessary to take one this weekend when it comes to relationships. One of you may be coming on too strong, making the other feel rushed or controlled. Words and feelings could easily be misconstrued. It’s also possible that everything is fine with your romance, but family members are sticking their noses where they don’t belong. This is not  the time to make a decision about anything major. Wait til Wednesday’s positive Mercury-Pluto trine.

"

"
8 august 2017,gemini,"You’re ready to launch some big plans, thanks to yesterday’s eclipse in the most optimistic and visionary part of your chart.

"
8 august 2016,gemini,"Setting boundaries and limits with people in your circle is necessary, Gemini. The planets warn that otherwise, you’ll be hopping to and fro as you try to keep up with their demands.

"
9 august 2016,gemini,"The Olympics are in full swing in Brazil, and we can all witness the results of the hard work put in by the athletes.

"
11 august 2017,gemini,"The recent lunar eclipse is pushing you to take some chances in life. But over the next three weeks you may pull back, afraid to stick your neck out. Why? Mercury retrogrades in your comfort-driven fourth house, the place where we seek security. You may also be concerned that you’ll take on more than you can handle. Fear not, Gemini–you’ll be able to pull it off without taking undue risk.

"
11 august 2016,gemini,"Emotions could be riding high in a romantic relationship, thanks to the sensitive Moon setting off critical angles with Mars and Saturn in your commitment sector. You may be feeling unsure as to your feelings or those of another person, not knowing whether the relationship is on solid ground or not. This vibe could also be present in a business alliance. Truth be told, this uncertainty will last into early next week. But Tuesday gives you the chance to gain some clarity and set plans in motion.

"
12 august 2017,gemini,"Yes! The two love planets, Venus and Neptune, from the best angle possible–a trine–and they are both is sectors that govern long term security. Hmmm, are those wedding bells I’m hearing? Proposals, the decision to move in together, developing greater stability in a union, meeting a keeper–all of these are possible in the days to come.

"
12 august 2016,gemini,"This could be a day when passion tries to override common sense, so stay on your toes! The reason? The emotional Moon swings past both rambunctious Mars and serious Saturn in your commitment sector, creating a push-pull when it comes to romance. Should I or shouldn’t I? With foggy Neptune in the mix, the possibility of making the wrong decision is there. Take your time.

"
13 august 2017,gemini,"The next 48 hours are excellent for communication, especially if you need to hammer out a long term arrangement or contract (which includes marriage, by the way!). Your best bet is to be as open as possible with others. With the Moon is your house of confidentiality you shouldn’t spill that which needs to be kept quiet, but honesty and frankness are still required.

"
13 august 2016,gemini,"What are your values in love? That has been the question the cosmos has been asking over the past few weeks and months, and there could have been some friction. This was due to Saturn’s five-month retrograde spin through the heavens, which may have provoked some deep thinking on your part. The good news is that the ringed planet goes direct, so it’s time to get off the fence and make a decision.

"
14 august 2017,gemini,"Hmmmm….does someone have a secret crush? Sure looks that way from your chart. Whether you are the crusher or the crushee is insignificant! Sparks can fly today (below the radar). Make sure that the other person is available and that you are too.

"
14 august 2016,gemini,"A bit of a tempest is brewing as the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, oppose each other in the heavens. You could be at the receiving end of some confusing messages from a loved one, or perhaps it’s you who feels unsure. You want to trust your feelings, but today’s not the best time to do so. Clarity returns on Wednesday.

"
15 august 2017,gemini,"Playing hard to get in love (or even business!) could backfire, so be wary of creating drama when there’s no need for it. However, if someone is trying to gain the upper hand with you, you’ll need to put them on notice that that isn’t going to fly.

"
15 august 2016,gemini,"A family or housing matter needs to be addressed as the Moon reaches out to Mercury in your domestic sector. Pluto is in on the action too, which means that whatever the issue is, it’s gonna be done.  Pluto doesn’t tolerate situations that drag on and on. It will pinpoint exactly what the problem is, but leaves it up to you to resolve it. Fortunately, Mercury will provide you with the smarts and eloquence to handle it.

"
16 august 2017,gemini,"With the Moon in your sign, your confidence level will rise, and you won’t be afraid to say what’s on your mind. People around you may not be ready for your newfound assurance, though, so don’t expect them to be overjoyed that you’re standing your ground!

And what could be better than a caper with your friends? Yup, an energetic trine today between the chatty Sun and spontaneous Uranus could find you and the tribe planning some kind of audacious getaway or a rager of a party. Move over, Thelma and Louise.

"
17 august 2017,gemini,"Playing footloose and fancy-free has its upside; so does playing it safe. Today’s cosmic energy produces a quandary in which you won’t know which route to take.

But Jupiter in your house of comfort and security opposes Chiron, suggesting that a little voice inside your head will be saying, “Slow down! Think things over first.” And while it’s always smart to look before you leap, you can’t make progress if you keep doing things the same way you’ve always done them.

19 august 2017,gemini,"It may come as a surprise that someone close doesn’t share the same values or long term plans as you. This could be a pal, a team at the office, a lover or family member, but either way it may throw you off your game a bit. Not to worry. Monday’s eclipse in your communication sector will help you get to the bottom of things.

"
19 august 2016,gemini,"Who’s wearing the pants in your relationships? Whether it’s at work, at home or in a friendship, the planets are telling you to be more assertive. There’s no need to scream and yell. No drama necessary. With the Moon in cahoots with Neptune, a sweet smile and serene composure will disarm everyone.

"
20 august 2016,gemini,"The recent full moon in Aquarius is pushing you out the door and telling you to have some adventures, but a Moon-Venus opposition today may make you feel duty-bound. The office can wait, as well as the cleaning, cooking, laundry, and oh yes, your parents and siblings. If you’re going to do anything around the house, it should be redecorating! Get thee to Bed, Bath and Beyond.

"
21 august 2016,gemini,"Feeling settled in your relationships with others and at home is going to be more important in the weeks ahead. With the Sun moving into your domestic sector on Monday, creating a cozy nest will be on the top of your list. Pretty easy to do if you live alone, but what happens if you have a spouse or lover under the same roof? A powerful Saturn-Mars conjunction this week will shine its light on the state of your union. How happy you are in love will definitely affect how happy you are at home.

"
22 august 2016,gemini,"Over the next four weeks you may find that you’re retreating a bit from the world now that the Sun is in Virgo. It’s a good time to declutter your home, redecorate or look for a new place to live. Your relationships with the people closest to you will be front and center this week, as Mars and Saturn are asking you to examine how secure and comfortable you feel around them. And if anyone is creating turbulence on the home front, chances are that you’re going to put a stop to it.

"
23 august 2016,gemini,"Slow down and pay attention to your intuition! The Moon in the most metaphysical part of your chart is stoking your personal psychic ability. In particular, you should be considering close relationships such as business alliances and romantic entanglements. The issue is that energetic Mars is getting you fired up to take action in a relationship, yet Saturn urges you to contemplate things slowly. Let your sixth sense be your guide.

"
24 august 2016,gemini,"Serious relationships may require a time out, whether they’re romantic or business related. A stern conversation between sober Saturn and red-hot Mars raises questions about how quickly you should be moving forward in your partnership. Mars can’t move ahead fast enough but Saturn is demanding that you know what you’re getting into. Already committed? Then it’s time to recalibrate your roles and expectations of each other.

"
25 august 2016,gemini,"What is it that you  want? An opposition between the Moon, Mars and Saturn may fire up a rebellious streak inside you. It’s not that you’re unwilling to go along with someone else’s plan in love or business, but your needs and concerns need to be addressed. Don’t move forward with plans until you speak your piece. There could be pushback from the other party on Friday, but your contentment and security are of paramount importance.

"
26 august 2016,gemini,"Dial it back at the office and don’t push anyone into doing anything right now. A tense Mars-Neptune square could fire you up to demand results or answers, but other people around you aren’t ready to do so. They may need more time, they could be playing games, but either way, it will backfire if you get in their faces. The same holds true for romantic partnerships today as well. And is you are at the receiving end of a hard sell, give it the 24-hour rule–or 48.

"
27 august 2017,gemini,"Temper, temper! Aggressive Mars has been retrograde in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, stirring up problems and feelings from the past. The good news is that it goes direct today. The not-so-good news is that you could still be all fired up. Watch your words, especially over the next 48 hours.

"
27 august 2016,gemini,"An amazing event happens today in the heavens: cathartic Jupiter meets up with magnetic Venus in an angle so tight that this won’t happen again for another 50 years. In your case Gemini, this occurs in your fourth house of emotions and feelings. This is a wonderful opportunity to release old feelings of not being worthy enough and start to feel comfortable in your skin again. Family matters are also well-aspected, whether it’s finding a new place to live or smoothing ruffled feathers.

"
28 august 2016,gemini,"Why do they have all the fun? That may be what you’re thinking today with a Moon-Uranus square. Friends and colleagues may seem like they’re living La Voda Loca while you’re stuck in Dullsville. The risk is that you may decide to indulge in some emotional spending, which isn’t going to change a thing. With lively Venus just about ready to enter Libra, your fifth house of fun and flirtation, the mood will lighten up soon.

"
29 august 2016,gemini,"Enjoying life will be high on your list over the next three weeks as Venus glides into your fifth house of fun and romance today. However, Mercury retrogrades also in your house of family matters, so if you need to spend quality time with the kids, pencil them in. Whether you’re single or attached, you may need to put certain family members on notice that your private life is just that–private.

"
30 august 2016,gemini,"Mercury goes retrograde today in the sector that deals with your family and home, and as retrogrades go this is a good one. Over the next few weeks you can iron out problems with parents, kids, siblings, landlords and roommates. With lovely Venus now in your romance area, it’s possible that living together is in the cards. Want to have a baby? That’s possible too under the current planetary influences.

"
31 august 2016,gemini,"Spontaneous Uranus is pushing you to express your emotions and get things out in the open. This is especially true of family and home-related matters with Mercury now retrograde in this part of your chart. But now that Venus is in your romance area, should you ask that hottie out on a date? Flirt outrageously? Post provocatively on social media? (Without being trashy, of course.) Hmmmm. The choice is yours.

"
1 september 2016,gemini,"Sometimes there’s nothing better than nesting at home, and today’s solar eclipse will encourage you to create a peaceful and serene home environment. But that might take more than a fresh coat of paint and a new duvet cover. It looks like some boundaries need to be set at your chateau, starting with not taking the stress of your workday home with you. And a lover may need to tone down their attitude and be a bit more cooperative.

"
2 september 2016,gemini,"It’s one thing to be helpful to someone and another to be an enabler or to get walked on. A T-square in the heavens could bring frustration in your relationships as you feel that you’re not keeping everyone happy. For heaven’s sakes, Gemini, lighten up! Planetary aspects indicate that you’re spreading yourself too thin as you aim to please. Take some time for yourself today.

"
3 september 2016,gemini,"It’s the perfect weekend to spend time with the family unit as La Luna touches off happy angles with Jupiter and Venus. If you have an elderly relative in assisted living or they’ve been home with too much time on their hands, it would mean a lot if you planned to visit them. Planets in your emotional sector of nostalgia and family ties recommend sharing memories of the past and preserving them for future generations.

"
4 september 2016,gemini,"With Pluto retrograding through one of the most sensitive parts of your chart, old emotions, fears and grudges are no doubt bubbling to the surface of your conscious mind. This is necessary, however. Release the baggage and move on. But today could be a bit tense as the Moon in your house of romance squares Pluto, reminding you of past disappointments and current dramas. This Wednesday is a fabulous day for getting things off your chest with a lover so that you can enter a happier, more contented phase.

"
5 september 2016,gemini,"Sometimes we need to create balance when it comes to whom we spend our time with, as what we actually do when we’re chilling out. A group of angles today suggests that you relax at home with your family (or maybe just by yourself with a good book and a bottle of wine!). As much as you may love your pals, take a breather from them, at least momentarily. When Jupiter enters Libra later this week you’ll be ready to get into the social crush again.

"
6 september 2016,gemini,"The next few days are super for creating domestic bliss as a number of celestial orbs are smiling at each other in the heavens. You’re in a perfect spot to find the right house, condo or apartment to live in, not to mention the best neighborhood. Smooth out family dramas to the best of your ability, which may require getting your emotions out there on the table. Wednesday is a good time to talk things over with family members or a lover, as a helpful Venus-Saturn sextile wants to bring stability at home.

"
7 september 2016,gemini,"Ready to settle down with a keeper? If that’s the case, romantic Venus and long-term Saturn have your back! The same holds true for smoothing out troubles in an existing relationship, conceiving a baby, and finding someone new. A wildly romantic year lies ahead as Jupiter is getting ready to soar into your fifth house of amour. Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.

"
8 september 2016,gemini,"It’s a sweet day for romance as the passionate Moon connects with lusty Mars and long-term Saturn.  With Jupiter entering the most enjoyable part of your chart tomorrow for the first time in 13 years, even the most settled relationships should see a surge in amorous moments. Just one caveat: don’t let your work life take over your free time. Life’s too short for your job to consume you.

"
9 september 2016,gemini,"Renaissance. The word literally means “rebirth”, and it holds special meaning, especially for you over the next 13 months. Abundant Jupiter has just entered your fifth house of creative mojo, enjoying culture, and appreciating the finer aspects of life. This is also the house where we find new love and bring new life onto the planet, so if you’ve been anxious to conceive, this is your year. It’s all about letting your hair down and having some fun, so enjoy this gift from the cosmos!

"
10 september 2016,gemini,"Lucky Jupiter entered your house of romance yesterday for the first time in over a decade, but don’t start planning your wedding or naming babies just yet. Couples need to be wary too, as a tough Neptune-Saturn square may serve you with a reality check. All Geminis run the risk of wearing rose-colored glasses when it comes to their mate and planning the future. Take off the shades and get real.

"
11 september 2016,gemini,"Expressing your deepest emotions could be a bit of a dilemma today as passionate Venus squares tough-guy Pluto. You may feel like there’s so  much bubbling up inside of you that you’d like to communicate, but that you’re tripping over your tongue. It’s possible that an individual in your orbit is pulling rank or trying to take control of a situation, exacerbating matters. But a lunar eclipse this Friday in your house of authority will put you in the driver’s seat.

"
12 september 2016,gemini,"If a certain relationship has become more trouble than it’s worth, you may be considering moving on. Drama, power struggles, anger–who needs it? Life’s too short. And now that fun-loving Jupiter is in your frisky fifth house of romance, culture and entertainment, you’ll only want to spend time with people who make your heart sing.

"
13 september 2016,gemini,"As the lunar eclipse this Friday draws near, you may be considering making some big changes in your career. But murky Neptune may be clouding your vision, making you vulnerable to the opinions of others. In addition, with the Sun in your house of comfort, you may be reluctant to shake up your routine. But eclipses pack a punch and provide us with the impetus to get past inertia!

"
14 september 2016,gemini,"Friday’s eclipse is designed to put you in the seat of authority, focusing on your goals, but today’s planetary activity suggests that you consider teaming up with others. No man or woman is an island, and the company you keep in the year ahead could prove to be key when it comes to the realization of your dreams.

"
15 september 2016,gemini,"People may be talking about you behind your back, but this is a good thing! It seems that a friend, mentor, client or boss may have put in a good word for you. Your talents and expertise are being discussed, and with tomorrow’s eclipse in your career sector, their compliments could pay off in the weeks and months ahead.

"
16 september 2016,gemini,"Get ready for your closeup! A sizzling lunar eclipse in your fame and success sector can open up doors over the next six months that may have been firmly shut in the past. Lunar events like this tend to close things out, so it’s possible that a boss or key client goes buh-bye. The could also be tension in business alliances due to a tense Mars angle. But overall this is a positive lunation, so set things in motion that will get your reputation and skills noticed by decision makers.

"
17 september 2016,gemini,"It’s a super day to make new contacts, and an inspirational time with people you already know. Lovers can start making plans for the future. Someone could offer you the chance to join a team or association that will propel your career forward. Singles could meet a new hottie via an introduction from a friend or by searching online. Hanging out at a hobby show could help you meet people who share your passion. Get out there and mingle!

"
18 september 2016,gemini,"You’re not in the mood for any surprises in love, unless of course it means meeting someone new when you weren’t expecting to, or getting a ring slipped on your finger! Today lovely Venus forms a sweet angle with Mars in your commitment sector, so get ready for some happy moments ahead.

"
19 september 2016,gemini,"Terrific day ahead for lovers as Venus in your house of romance winks at lusty Mars in the commitment sector! With the Moon in secluded Taurus you may be feeling the need for even more intimacy. Singles,  you’re not excluded. Someone at the office or in your industry may be harboring a secret crush on you.  But should you go down that path?

"
20 september 2016,gemini,"Your deepest emotions and thoughts can get an “upgrade” this week as not one, but two positive trines occur between intelligent Mercury and metamorphic Pluto. The first one takes place today, and with Mercury retrograde, it will help you reflect on past dramas and feelings of jealousy, resentment, or anger (we all have them!). By Friday Mercury will be direct, so while today is perfect for self-assessment, Friday is better for talking about your thoughts.

"
22 september 2016,gemini,"If you’ve been looking for love in all the wrong places, those days are over. The Sun has just joined Jupiter in your fifth house of romance, making the next four weeks the best time in over a decade (you read that right) to find love, conceive a baby, or reach a higher level of commitment in an existing romance. The 26th is the best day of them all!

"
23 september 2016,gemini,"The emotional Moon in Cancer may push you to demand answers from a lover, which may not be the best move under current planetary influences. Let sleeping dogs lie, at least for the next few days. Likewise, remain patient about finding new love. Monday is an incredible day for all Geminis to make progress in romance.

"
24 september 2016,gemini,"Don’t be strong-armed, or even mildly influenced, to spend money on something if you’re not sure of its worth—or your ability to pay down the debt associated with it. The emotional Moon in your money house could encourage you to spend, but hold off for now.

"
25 september 2016,gemini,"With sultry Venus now in your house of physique and fitness, looking and feeling your best will become a focus over the next three weeks. It looks like some readjustment is necessary though in order to make this work. Venus forms an aspect with Neptune in your ambition sector that indicates the need to either switch up your workout schedule or to reconsider your “deadlines”. Shredding for the wedding (or the high school reunion) could be a bit too much right now.

"
26 september 2016,gemini,"Romance is the main course on your menu over the next few months as a series of yummy planetary aspects helps you not only enjoy the company of another person, but to enjoy life in general. A happy meeting today between the Sun and optimistic Jupiter in your house of amour and creativity will enable you to find new love, conceive a baby, or get more serious about the person you’re involved with. Saturday brings a new moon in the same part of the sky, opening a six-month window of opportunity.

"
27 september 2016,gemini,"Keep a close eye on your spending over the next 7 weeks as Mars has just entered your eighth house of financial stability. The red planet’s presence in this sector can do two things: make you want to spend like crazy, or inspire you to budget, save and invest. The choice is yours. Powerful Pluto just ended a five-month retrograde in this house, pointing out weaknesses in your financial portfolio and your personal habits. Hopefully you’ve gained some insight and will now apply it!

"
28 september 2016,gemini,"Trying to close a major client, land a new job or negotiate a raise? If so, take what you hear with a grain of salt. Someone in a position of authority might be blowing smoke up your hoo-ha as deceptive Neptune is in a tough angle. Even  if you’re not in the midst of negotiations, the boss or some kind of authority figure could be full of BS today. Smile, then go off and regroup.

"
29 september 2016,gemini,"A friend or acquaintance could reach out or react in an unexpected manner, Gemini. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing though, as whatever transpires can help you build a better relationship. Your emotions may go all over the place as the Moon is one of the most sensitive parts of your chart. Keep calm, listen, then adjust as necessary.

"
30 september 2016,gemini,"We’ve all heard the term “getting lucky”, but your sign can benefit the most today when it comes to romance! A fortuitous meeting of the passionate Moon and abundant Jupiter could bring in a new love, pregnancy, engagement or renewal of your vows. It’s also the perfect aspect for planning a fun night out, especially at a cultural event. Enjoy!

"
1 october 2016,gemini,"Gemini, you’re in luck as today’s new moon falls in your house of romance, fun and creativity! Over the next few months you should be carving out quality time for your lover, kids and yes, yourself. Sign up for cooking classes, hit some art galleries, plan a quick vacay and take the kids to a museum. Singles, this is one of your best times all year to meet someone new. A happy Venus-Neptune trine suggests that the best place to meet a hottie is at the gym, the office or your industry.

"
2 october 2016,gemini,"Yesterday’s new moon in Libra ushered in a period in which you’ll want to be out there mingling with others, for all sorts of reasons–joining forces with likeminded people to support a good cause, searching for love or making more industry contacts. Some of these people will remain in your orbit for years to come, so keep an open mind and look for folks who will only add to your experiences.

"
3 october 2016,gemini,"The planets indicate that you need to enjoy life more, and now is the right time to delve into hobbies, sports and creative pursuits. Don’t worry, the work will still be piled up on your desk on Monday morning. But at least you had the opportunity to blow off some steam and treat yourself to some indulgence.

"
4 october 2016,gemini,"Your ability to lay out a workable plan for the future increases today as the benevolent Sun points out some of the best directions to head in. From your chart it appears that you want to live a more fun-filled, enjoyable life as you take care of the daily grind. Living more creatively is on the table right now, as is finding the right person to share your time with. the initiatives you take will have long term ramifications, so choose wisely.

"
5 october 2016,gemini,"Try to wrap up discussions at work or home about the division of labor, budgeting and deadlines. A productive Venus-Pluto trine will help you take an authoritative stance without coming off like a bully. Also, make sure that you  are on target with individual goals and chores. Later in the week some difficult angles threaten to derail plans and projects; now is the time to get organized.

"
6 october 2016,gemini,"Friction may arise in a close relationship as the two most energetic planets, Mars and Jupiter, are at loggerheads today. You may be prone to overanalyzing as you try to predict a future outcome. Or you might let negative emotions, such as mistrust, jealousy or impatience get in your way. Don’t push things or overreact, because this energy will be bubbling up through the 15th of the month.

"
7 october 2016,gemini,"Sharing is caring! Or is it? With verbose Mercury entering your house of romance and children today, you may be tempted over the next few weeks to have some serious conversations with your loved ones. Which is fine….except that the Sun, already in this part of the sky, and Mercury will be in tight angles to others in the next two weeks. Battles over who’s in charge may erupt, along with moodiness, egotistical dramas and maybe even resentment. Use your words to heal, not to wound.

"
8 october 2016,gemini,"Confidence is sexy, and you should have it in spades this weekend as La Luna swings past the two most charismatic planets in the solar system, Mars and Pluto. Romantic Neptune in your success sector forms a sweet angle to all three, so to say that you might “get lucky” is an understatement! Boudoir escapades aside, this is also a smart time to consider your biggest dreams and how to execute them.

"
9 october 2016,gemini,"This is a good day to get in touch with your deepest thoughts and feelings, whether you decide to share them or keep them to yourself. The emotional Moon moves past transformative Pluto and high octane Mars, a positive aspect for identifying thought patterns that don’t serve you and then letting them go.

"
10 october 2016,gemini,"Your creativity and talents get a boost this week as planets in your fifth house of skill form terrific aspects. Today is especially auspicious as the Moon in your blue-skies-ahead sector urges you to polish up your skills even more. Find a mentor, take a class, attend a weekend workshop or seminar or buy a book that will inspire you.

"
11 october 2016,gemini,"Yum! A delicious meet up between Mercury and abundant Jupiter is all about romance: finding it, enhancing it, and basically having more fun in life. Just make sure that you and a lover are on the same page when it comes to finances. Singles, beware of falling for a charming but broke lover. With next week’s full moon in your house of camaraderie, a friend is the best way to meet someone new.

"
12 october 2016,gemini,"Fears and insecurities may get the better of you today as eager Mars stirs things up in your house of emotions. Resist the urge to push others for an answer or a commitment, whether it’s a financial matter or one that involves the heart. This cosmic energy will persist for another week, so patience is going to be needed.

"
13 october 2016,gemini,"It’s essential that you don’t read too much into a situation, a possibility with commanding Mars in your house of emotions. Otherwise jealousy, fear and resentment could bubble up to the surface of your psyche, wreaking havoc. This is especially true in matters of the heart. You could also be running hot and cold, not knowing from day to day how you feel about a particular person. Some of the fog will clear at Sunday’s full moon.

"
14 october 2016,gemini,"If you need to discuss something with a lover, child or business partner today’s the best day to do so. Serious Saturn is in a helpful angle, trying to set things in stone. Such as: marriage plans, custody arrangements for a child, the division of labor in your company, or selling your artwork. Tomorrow ain’t going to be so easy, so carpe diem.

"
15 october 2016,gemini,"Emotions all over the place? Not surprising with four planets all at odds today! In your case, Gemini, they are active in the sectors of love, family and friends. Someone close may act erratically, throwing you off balance. It’s also possible that a power struggle erupts as someone (you maybe?) uses guilt, fear or jealousy to manipulate a situation to their liking. Tomorrow’s full moon will bring this to a head, so get ready to make some serious decisions.

"
16 october 2016,gemini,"A full moon/supermoon in your eleventh house of friends and networking could bring something to a close, such as a project you’ve been working on, like bachelorette party plans or a team work assignment. This is the house that governs technology, so anything digital could reach a climax: launching a new website, putting the finishing touches on an app you’re coding or successfully wrapping up a social media campaign. But full moons will shine their light also on what’s not working, such as a friend, team member or software program that just isn’t cutting it any longer. If that’s the case, resolve to make necessary changes.

"
17 october 2016,gemini,"Our thoughts create our emotions and our actions. Everything we do begins with a thought. And today a helpful aspect takes place between the cleansing Moon and transformative Pluto in the parts of your chart that deal with your innermost thoughts.

"
19 october 2016,gemini,"One heck of a day lies ahead, Gemini! A megawatt meeting between Pluto and Mars in your sexy eighth house could stir up passionate emotions. Whether you’re single or attached the desire to bond with someone could be sky high. With this kind of energy, you won’t be interested in wimps or bores but the strong, lusty type. Not only that, your finances could get a lift as a power broker or decision maker provides you with assistance. This could be a mortgage broker, judge, angel investor or potential business partner. Make sure that you network over the next few days.

"
20 october 2016,gemini,"Who’s on your side? This may have been on your mind over the past week, as the recent full moon may have found you questioning the motives of people in your innermost circle. Today the questions linger on with a Mercury-Uranus opposition. It could simply be that there are too many people around you providing different opinions and advice, and it’s hard to figure out which direction to go in. Take a deep breath and relax. When the Sun enters Scorpio on Saturday clarity will return.

"
21 october 2016,gemini,"Keep a cool head about you today when it comes to financial matters. A tense Moon-Pluto-Mars opposition could find you stewing about money: how much you’re saving vs. spending, the return you’re receiving on a particular investment, or which way to go in a career matter. With the mighty Sun entering your efficiency sector this weekend, you’re in a perfect spot for figuring out answers to these questions.

"
22 october 2016,gemini,"Time to get your act together. Now that the Sun is in Scorpio, you need to address the piles of papers on your desk, unfinished projects, and inefficient ways of getting things done. Over the next four weeks you should take a look at your habits and routines when it comes to your home and work life. If this means hiring help, obtaining better technology, or switching to more reliable vendors, so be it. The new moon on the 30th is a great time to inaugurate changes.

"
23 october 2016,gemini,"Who’s wearing the pants in your relationship? That’s a question for both romantic liaisons and business ones. The earlier part of this week could see a struggle erupt between you and another person who may be trying to gain control of a situation. However, their tactics may be passive-aggressive rather than direct. Today’s a good time to analyze the situation and make efforts to find an equal balance.

"
24 october 2016,gemini,"Werk it! Now that intelligent Mercury is in your house of efficiency, you should be able to dazzle others with your can-do attitude and your ability to plow through assignments with ease and accuracy. A new moon will take place in this part of the sky soon, so both of these orbs can help you line up a new job, better clients or projects, and perhaps even juicier benefits. This Thursday is perfect for showcasing your talents.

"
25 october 2016,gemini,"Someone may try to pull rank with you, and it may be someone close such as a lover or business partner. A difficult Venus-Neptune square may find you questioning who’s in charge of an alliance. If it’s a supervisor at work, obviously they’re the boss, but they could resort to criticism, passive-aggressive behavior or just plain old bulls***. This should pass quickly and on Wednesday you’ll have the opportunity to get centered again.

"
26 october 2016,gemini,"Sweet! A happy angle between love planet Venus in your commitment sector and optimistic Jupiter in your romance zone bodes well for romance.

Dazzle bosses and clients with a presentation of your ideas. Prospect for new business. Brainstorm with your colleagues. Propose new protocols or routines that will help make things move more efficiently. At the very least, streamline your own work flow by wrapping up unfinished business, returning calls and e-mails and clearing off your desk.

"
28 october 2016,gemini,"Lucky Jupiter has been gracing your house of romance since September, its first visit here in over 12 years. And today the passionate Moon forms a super aspect with Jupiter, allowing you to get in touch with your emotions concerning someone else. Got a crush on someone? Let them know! Attached Geminis should plan a sexy date night out. This is also a terrific opportunity to spend quality time with kids, possibly even taking them to work with you so they could learn more about your life.

"
29 october 2016,gemini,"Defining moment! Love planet Venus meets up with long-term Saturn in your commitment sector. Should you stay in a relationship or move on? Many Geminis could decide to tie the knot under this aspect, while singles could meet a serious contender for their heart. But there is some static coming from the sidelines, as a friend or acquaintance may act out—possibly out of jealousy. With lusty Mars in your house of libido, your sex life (or lack of one) could become an issue in romance. Talk things over.

"
30 october 2016,gemini,"Ready to pull ahead of the pack? A terrific new moon takes place in your sixth house of work and efficiency. Typically, when a new moon occurs here you can impress the boss and clients but not necessarily land a new job. But this one is a game changer as Mercury trines Neptune in your career zone the same day. You could become inspired to seek out a big promotion, a new gig or even start your own company. If you’re happy where you are, this lunation is perfect for streamlining your workday and reducing stress.

"
31 october 2016,gemini,"Yesterday’s new moon is stirring up your desire to get things done which is always a good thing. But you need to stay focused and not let the people around you throw you off task, a possibility under current planetary aspects. Your newfound can-do attitude may invoke envy in others who may be determined to slow down your progress. Charge ahead!

1 november 2016,gemini,"Step into a more authoritative role. A glorious Sun-Neptune trine helps to dispel any misconceptions as to who’s the boss. Whether it’s at home, at work or a group endeavor (such as the PTO or a charity) you need to let others know that you can, and will, get the job done. The recent new moon is turning you into a force of nature; slackers beware!

"
2 november 2016,gemini,"With the Sun in your house of productivity you may be so focused on getting things done that you can’t see the big picture. While it’s commendable to scratch items of your to-do list, you also need a little romance and adventure. Luckily the planets have that in mind for you. When lusty Mars enters your house of risk taking on the 9th (its first trip here in two years) you’ll start spreading your wings and taking flight—away from the grunt work!

"
3 november 2016,gemini,"You’re in a terrific place for developing new habits and protocols that will have a positive long term effect on your life. Sometimes just establishing a daily ritual or routine is all it takes to solidify actions that will help you, such as staying on a diet or keeping clutter reduced. The planets suggest that you also examine your emotions and past feelings to determine why previous attempts to get things done didn’t work out. Do that and you can move forward.

"
4 november 2016,gemini,"Sick of being a doormat, enabler or being taken for granted? Maybe you’re fed up too with someone’s jealousy or over-the-top emotions. If that’s the case, you may feel it keenly today as the Moon swings past Pluto. There’s no point in getting emotional about it, but there is  a point in deciding to end it. Pluto is the planet of power—seize your own by mastering your own emotions first.

"
5 november 2016,gemini,"Don’t feel guilty about enjoying life and all of the good things it offers. You deserve love, health and success (whatever success means to you), and this should become apparent with today’s happy Venus-Uranus trine. It’s also a sweet day for romance: singles could meet a keeper, couples can go the distance. Whatever you do, don’t stay home alone. It’s a highly social weekend and this is just one of the ways to live the good life—in the company of friends.

"
6 november 2016,gemini,"Life can’t be all about work. Giving back–to your community, church, the less fortunate or helping protect the environment–can make you feel a lot more in tune with our fabulous planet. Today free-spirited Uranus encourages you to take part in something bigger than yourself. You may end up being amazed at the change in perspective you develop.

"
7 november 2016,gemini,"With the Sun in your structured sixth house of duty, routine and getting through the grunt work, you may wonder if there will be some play time in the near future. Well, say “Hallelujah, amen!” because effervescent Mars is just about ready to enter your free-wheeling house of adventure on Wednesday. Start planning capers and mayhem right now.

"
8 november 2016,gemini,"If you want a project to go to the next level, you may need the assistance of others. You should be filled with a lot of ambition and bright ideas, courtesy of the Moon in your expansive ninth house, but the cosmos suggests that two (or more) heads are better than one right now. Team efforts hold a lot of promise for you, even if that means sucking it up and dealing with slackers and malcontents. Don’t worry—by mid-December you’ll be able to go it alone.

"
9 november 2016,gemini,"Emotional breakthroughs are a big, happy possibility for you over the next three weeks! First, energetic Mars moves into your house of optimism and blue-skies thinking today. Then on Friday lovely Venus glides into the sector that governs your deepest feelings, especially some of the stinky ones like regret, jealousy, resentment and anger. These two orbs will help you get to the bottom of things that have been bothering you, maybe for years, so that you can release them and move on. Kudos!

"
10 november 2016,gemini,"You could become quite emotional today about an ambition that’s important to you, but that’s a good thing—it’s called “passion”.  As the Moon glides past Neptune inspiration can strike. Pay attention to the ideas, gut hunches and dreams that you have in the days ahead, as they will provide you with insight. The key is to take your passion projects and create logical, step-by-step plans to achieve them, easy to do with the Sun in your efficiency zone.

"
11 november 2016,gemini,"Ggrrrr, tiger! Sexy Venus just glided into your house of libido for a steamy three-week stay. With Monday’s full moon pending in your house of secrecy and fantasies, this is a good weekend to get a room, if you catch my drift. Singles, Saturn is in your commitment house, urging you to find the Real Deal. Just be wary in the weeks ahead of lusty, charismatic characters who show a lot of promise in the boudoir but not elsewhere.

"
12 november 2016,gemini,"It’s time to open up the lines of communication with the people closest to you, especially romantic and business partners. Candid Mercury just entered your relating sector, so get things off your chest. With the upcoming full moon on Monday, you may have a lot on your mind that needs to get out. Now’s the time. If they can’t handle it…so be it.

"
13 november 2016,gemini,"Put a fork in it–it’s done.  And you may be totally done with whacked out co-workers, demanding family members, your ever-expanding waist line and the sense that there’s more to life than this. Blame it on the super moon that arrives tomorrow in your house of closure. This can be a powerfully beneficial full moon, but only if you resolve to make changes.

"
14 november 2016,gemini,"Going viral is a darn good possibility for you, Cancer, as a super moon in your house of technology today helps you lock down a winner! Any tech project for that matter can shine under these auspices, such as updating a website, starting a blog, coding an app or even finding a lover online. But this lunation isn’t just about pounding the keyboard on your computer; it’s also perfect for socializing with friends, getting involved in volunteer organizations and joining forces with others for a terrific collaboration.

"
15 november 2016,gemini,"Keep your emotions in check, especially when dealing with people in positions of authority. A power broker/boss could be difficult to decipher, handing you a ration of BS over something you didn’t do, or they’re vacillating from one position to another. The good news is that with Mars in your expansive, big-picture-thinking ninth house, you will be able to easily see the broader view. Of course, the fact that you can see things that the boss can’t could be a part of their problem!

"
16 november 2016,gemini,"Is your life in balance? Do you get to your chores at home in a prompt and efficient manner—or are you drowning in a sea of unfinished and urgent things to do? The same holds true for your office routines and workload. If you’re not on top of things, then today is a good time to examine your habits and systems for weaknesses. Take a good look too at any group activities that may be mired in red tape, procrastination or chaos. You can only be responsible for your own actions, but you can still point out to others that there’s a better way of getting things done.

"
17 november 2016,gemini,"The next few days could be uncomfortable as murky Neptune is creating waves in your house of authority. On the one hand, you may feel as though you’re being manipulated by people and things that are bigger than you, which undermines your sense of security. On the other, it may be you who is trying to push people and circumstances around in order to get your way. The recent full moon may have drummed up feelings of low self-worth; don’t let them cloud your judgment.

"
18 november 2016,gemini,"Got a business deal you’re trying to close? Or maybe you need an answer from a lover—now—because you’re anxious to move the relationship to the next level. All I can say is, “Good luck!” Don’t count on a firm answer today, or for that matter, an honest one. Neptune, planet of obfuscation, is stirring the pot. You’re better off waiting for the Sun to move into Sagittarius on Monday, which will put you in more of a powerful situation. Make sure that the people you’re dealing with truly support you.

"
19 november 2016,gemini,"Get ready to take ownership of your ambitions as confusing Neptune finally goes direct after a five month hiatus. Since June or July you may have been unable to decide on a particular path to take, or found that others were indecisive and not willing to commit. That’s about to change fast! With the Sun entering your partnership sector on Monday, you could see forward motion with romantic relationships or business alliances. Just remember: you’re in the driver’s seat now.

"
20 november 2016,gemini,"It’s a perfect day to pick up the phone, call a friend and head off on a spontaneous little adventure. Rebellious Uranus wants you to spend less time working around the house and the office and more quality time for yourself. Besides, you never know whom you might meet while you’re out cavorting! A pal could be an important source of an introduction in the week ahead.

"
21 november 2016,gemini,"Intimacy and romance are two separate things. After all, what’s the point in having a lover if you can’t connect with them on a deeply emotional, even spiritual level? Dinners out and good sex can only go so far. This week will bring this point home as you will have to examine how soulful a relationship you truly have. Fear not, however–the Sun enters your commitment sector today, an auspicious aspect for long term bonding.

"
22 november 2016,gemini,"Now that the Sun is in your partnership sector, relating to others should become a lot easier. You may need to use more creative ways to get through to the people in your circle, be they family members or people at the office. But a happy angle today will help you do just that. Sometimes just planning a fun luncheon or evening out, away from the stress of home base, is enough to get people to lighten up.

"
23 november 2016,gemini,"Are you ready to go the distance? In romance, that is! A megawatt meeting between Mercury and Saturn presses you to have The Talk with a lover. You know, the one that starts off with, “Where is this relationship going?” It’s time to get off the fence, as Saturn is the planet of long-term planning. If either you or your lover are holding back—expressing love, getting engaged, planning a family—next week’s new moon is going to shine its light on the issue. Single? You could meet a keeper in the days ahead.

"
24 november 2016,gemini,"Mixed signals could arise between you and a romantic partner, and the problem seems to be a lack of communication. Pluto and Mercury are both in your house of intimacy, encouraging you to pour your heart out—and maybe you’re doing just that without enough feedback from the other person. It’s critical right now to not just get carried away with a romance, but to know deep down that this person is right for you. The only way you’ll know is by studying their actions and paying attention to their words.

"
25 november 2016,gemini,"Love relationships can take a dramatic turn for the better as Venus and Pluto encourage you to share your thoughts and emotions with your amour. Singles, now’s the time to be on the lookout for a soulmate, someone who will truly understand you. The new moon on the 29th is custom made for all Geminis to open up a new chapter in romance. Listen to your own heart and not the advice of others when you make your pick.

"
26 november 2016,gemini,"If there’s one message the cosmos wants you to get these days, Gemini, it’s that partnering with others is your ticket to living a better life. Your chart is loaded with planets in the houses that govern business alliances, volunteer groups, friendship, industry connections and romance. To shut yourself off from the world would be a crime, especially with today’s terrific Mercury-Uranus trine encouraging you to get out and mingle.

"
27 november 2016,gemini,"Friends with benefits? Don’t be surprised if a “pal” shows more interest in you than usual. Likewise, a friend may want to set you up with someone, or express their opinion about your love life. Don’t go there. Planetary influences indicate that you’re better off relying on your own opinion than the opinions of others.

"
28 november 2016,gemini,"Romance reboot! The new moon on Tuesday falls in your house of commitment, which bodes well for attached Geminis who need to put the spark back in their romance. Singles could meet a new beau or belle with long term potential. With lusty Mars in your house of adventure, things could get (ahem) interesting.

"
29 november 2016,gemini,"Two heads are better than one and today’s lunar activity encourages you to join forces with other people for a common goal. Find an exercise buddy, a local mom who’s willing to swap baby sitting duties, or a business partner. Looking for love? Jupiter is in a super angle, helping singles find a keeper and couples to develop an even deeper bond. Just keep an eye on finances, both in love and commerce. Know what you’re getting into if an alliance requires an investment of cash or sharing money. Is your partner solvent, and do they share the same goals?

"
30 november 2016,gemini,"Cooperation may be in short supply as people around you all seem to be focused on their own agenda. Trouble is, with the jovial Sun in your partnership sector, you’re  willing to work with others. If someone else is wearing their bossy pants, let ‘em. This soon shall pass. Just focus on your own needs and activities today.

"
1 december 2016,gemini,"Your optimism about life will soar as energetic Mars and abundant Jupiter hold their once a year meeting. Luckily for you, they’re in your romance and adventure sectors, and they’re determined to bust you out of a rut. This is a mind expanding vibe, so consider taking a class, hanging out with new people from other cultures, exploring different philosophies or going to an off-the-beaten path travel destination.

"
2 december 2016,gemini,"Talk flirty to me! If there was ever a time to get your feelings out in the open with a romantic partner it’s now, Gemini. Transformative Pluto and love planet Venus are in your house of sharing deep emotions, and today they’re joined by verbal Mercury. While this can bring about sexy texting, this is also a time for soulful discussions in which you can make a lot of progress. Make sure to hold meaningful discussions before the 19th as Mercury will retrograde then. And the last thing you need at the holidays is unnecessary drama with your lover.

"
3 december 2016,gemini,"Your creativity is off the charts these days, so don’t dismiss ideas that come your way. Whether you dream up fabulous ideas for decorating your house, the ultimate client presentation, better ways to communicate with your kids or an invention that will make you a millionaire, there’s no limit to what you can achieve. And when Venus enters Aquarius next Wednesday, you’ll be even more inspired.

"
4 december 2016,gemini,"Your attitudes and emotions toward love may improve this week as a number of positive aspects are buoying your optimism. The great thing is that this confidence will spill over to other parts of your life. Once your mind has been expanded and you see things differently, there’s usually no going back to old ways of thinking. Life is too short to spend your days thinking about the small stuff.

"
5 december 2016,gemini,"This is no time to keep bright ideas hidden under a bushel, Gemini. Your ability to come up with solutions to problems or profitable ideas for a business are fabulous under current planetary conditions. But you’re going to need help turning these into reality, so seek out the help of people in the know. Someone whom you may not expect to be in your corner could actually turn out to be an angel is disguise.

"
6 december 2016,gemini,"With energetic Mars in your house of far flung travel, this is a good time to plan a trip that’s more than just downtime—it’s an adventure. And with spontaneous Uranus active in your friendship sector, consider which partners in crime you’d like to bring with you on this adventure. Parents, leave the kids at home and take a voyage with some other burned out adults. You need to recharge your batteries.

"
7 december 2016,gemini,"Busting out of a rut is what the cosmos has planned for you, Gemini! Dynamic Mars has been in the most adventurous part of your chart, and now Venus is joining him today. With next week’s full moon in Gemini spotlighting you—your passions, goals and dreams—it’s time to think about how you can radically switch things up. From your love life to career to travel plans, think outside the box.

"
8 december 2016,gemini,"Filters, please! Before you say it (or text it) think twice about your words. The problem is the assertive Mars is in your highly opinionated ninth house, and even though you may be entitled to your own ideas, others may not agree. Nor will they enjoy seeing how motivated you’ve become. Unless you want to deal with backlash, keep things low key.

"
9 december 2016,gemini,"Planetary influences indicate that you need to get crystal clear about a romantic or business partnership, and today’s a good time to focus. Saturday brings a major meeting between the Sun and Saturn in which you’ll have to make some choices. Consider whether you need to retain the services of a booking agent, attorney or PR agent. Ask yourself if your lover is the right one for you, or if there are issues that need to be settled. Next week’s full moon in your sign is telling you to take care of #1.

"
10 december 2016,gemini,"Significant progress can be made today in partnerships, but the key is to make sure first that you’re both on the same page. If you’ve been kidding yourself about a romantic partner or business alliance, sober Saturn will smack you upside the head. Under current planetary aspects you may find that others are interested in joining forces with you, but you need to be choosy.

"
11 december 2016,gemini,"Holding a heart to heart discussion with someone is a good way to cement your relationship, Gemini. The emotional Moon is in a terrific angle today to help you dig deep and get your emotions and thoughts out there. You may end up being surprised at the way your connection to this person is transformed. It’s important to do this now before the full moon in your sign on Tuesday, as it will close out one chapter so that other can begin.

"
12 december 2016,gemini,"To thine own self be true? The people around you, from family to friends to lovers, may be full of advice and some of it may sound pretty darn good. But the cosmos suggests that you pay attention to that small, still voice of wisdom in your head that always seems to guide you in the right direction. Tomorrow’s full moon in your sign will ask you to balance your own opinions against those of others. Don’t let anyone twist your arm into doing things their way.

"
13 december 2016,gemini,"Woo-hoo! The cosmos delivers a glistening full moon in your sign today, Gemini. It’s time to focus on your goals, dreams and passions and what you’d like to accomplish in 2017. If a relationship has been less than satisfying, you may decide to move on with a Moon-Saturn opposition. It’s critical that you share the same values and wishes for the future. That being said, a luscious Moon-Jupiter aspect bodes well for creating more romantic moments in your union or even finding new love.

"
14 december 2016,gemini,"Considering that yesterday’s full moon fell in your sign, Gemini, your needs and dreams will be foremost in your mind. Not in a selfish way, but a healthy one. You’re ready to move forward with some big plans, but your friends and romantic partner may not be on board. They’re in for a big surprise once Mars enters your house of authority next Monday. Nothing is going to hold you back.

"
15 december 2016,gemini,"Get ready for a s*** storm as four celestial orbs can’t seem to get their act together today. It’s really just a matter of mixed signals coming from the general direction of your lover, kids and friends. This storm will be brief, however, and by Saturday you’ll be in a much better place to figure out what people are thinking. When Mercury retrogrades next week it will be time to think about your  emotions for a change.

"
17 december 2016,gemini,"The energy of the recent full moon in Gemini is still in effect, and it puts your needs and goals in the forefront of your mind. Today is perfect for holding conversations with friends and partners, be they romantic or business. They may be able to provide you with some thought-provoking advice that will be helpful in the months ahead. Keep an open mind and consider all of your options.

"
18 december 2016,gemini,"You may be tempted to hold back and not express your opinions today, as a tense Moon-Mars opposition warns against it. But that doesn’t mean that you’ll be suffering in silence in the weeks ahead. Quite the opposite! You’ll be too busy to care. That’s because aggressive Mars moves into your house of personal ambition tomorrow, firing you up to focus on what’s important to you. Worrying about what others think won’t be a priority.

"
19 december 2016,gemini,"The mighty Sun is just about to move into your house of big money–investments, retirement accounts, perks, court awards, inheritances and joint business ventures. But pesky little Mercury retrogrades in the same sector today, so before you move ahead with any major financial decisions you need to make sure that the numbers add up. If possible wait until mid-January to sign papers or make your move.

"
20 december 2016,gemini,"If you want to move forward with a big goal, it would be wise to make sure that the financial and tech aspects of it are in order. Mercury is retrograde in your eighth house of big money and the last thing you need is chaos with a website or funding. That being said, when the Sun enters Capricorn on Wednesday you can make significant progress with any ambition of your choosing. You will be pouring a lot of passion into it, and the week after Christmas is super for developing momentum.

"
21 december 2016,gemini,"It’s time to start making some serious coin. With the Sun in the part of your chart that’s all about increasing your net worth, and mighty Mars in your career zone, you couldn’t ask for better aspects to start pulling in more cash. This isn’t about your income so much as making smart investments and managing your funds more carefully. Considering that Mercury is retrograde in this part of your chart, you should look to the past. What mistakes did you make? What did you do right? How can you increase your cash flow? Is there a business you should start, or a product that you can patent and develop?

"
22 december 2016,gemini,"The level of drama in your relationships could get ratcheted up a bit with a meeting today between the passionate Moon and Jupiter. You may feel like expressing yourself openly. But can the people around you handle that? If in doubt, hold back on your opinions.

"
23 december 2016,gemini,"Don’t assume that you can’t make major progress today with a career goal, because you can. A lucky Moon-Mars trine makes this a super day to send out your resume, reach out to a potential client or research that business idea that you have. Next week is actually a busy week in the cosmos with excellent aspects for forward momentum. Take advantage of it!

"
24 december 2016,gemini,"Christmas is a time for dreaming and making wishes, and you will be doing just that in the days ahead. With Uranus in the house of your deepest hopes forming a superb aspect today to Saturn, you’ll be thinking about how to logically pursue your dreams. There’s no need to put yourself out on a limb–you can create a happy future and still maintain some security.

"
25 december 2016,gemini,"As the new year approaches you’re feeling friskier and ready for change. You could really feel that today as Venus, in the most adventurous part of your chart, pushes you to think about how you could live life more creatively. Whether that means choosing more exotic travel destinations, taking up a hobby or adding more sizzle to a romance, start pushing past previous limits.

"
26 december 2016,gemini,"Break the mold. That’s the message from the cosmos today with a rare Uranus-Jupiter opposition. Should you feel free to express yourself creatively or should you follow the rules of society? Is fitting in with the crowd really worth it? Let’s face it, most of the great artists, scientists, writers and thinkers have been misfits. But then, they’re the ones who’ve made it into the history books.

"
27 december 2016,gemini,"It’s time to take charge of your mental well-being with a strong Sun-Mars aspect. If you’re plagued with negative thoughts such as jealousy, obsession or fear, you need to do some personal work and cleansing. Fortunately this is a very cathartic vibe so do whatever it takes: meditate, talk to a friend or therapist, get out in nature or study ancient philosophies such as Zen or Tao.

"
28 december 2016,gemini,"Excellent day to think and talk about money–the big kind, not chump change. The cosmos wants you to get serious about building a firm foundation for the future: college funds, retirement, plenty of cash for emergencies and enough for medical bills. With a new moon tomorrow in this part of your chart, you should be examining bank statements, figuring out a way to pay down debt and considering your next career move.

"
29 december 2016,gemini,"Be nice to your friends. Very nice. While you’re at it, find some new ones. Now that Uranus resumes forward motion in your house of networking, your pals and industry contacts can be a big source of help in all areas of your life. With a new moon in your house of intimacy, a friend could introduce you to a keeper. Doors could begin to open in business too, as this lunation could point out a smart investment to or profitable joint venture.

"
30 december 2016,gemini,"Peace at last? A highly cathartic vibe helps you heal your tired, maybe wounded soul. Cleansing your spirit of fears, resentment and other unpleasant energy is what it’s all about today. Inspirational Neptune is in a take-charge mood, so chances are that you’ll be motivated to clear out the mental junk without much prodding from others.

"
31 december 2016,gemini,"A friend may come to your aid in a rather unexpected way in the days ahead, a happy circumstance indeed! They could tip you off about a job opening, introduce you to a potential suitor, or provide sound advice about which direction to head in. A helpful way to start off the new year, don’t you think?

"
1 january 2017,cancer,"With a lot of planetary activity in the most free-wheeling, optimistic part of your chart, you may feel as though there are no limits as to what you can achieve this year. And you’re right! The good news is that logical Saturn in your house of strategizing and streamlining will help you develop the good habits you need in order to get things done. Of all the signs of the zodiac, you should have more discipline and drive.

"
2 january 2017,cancer,"Plans take flight! Now that Uranus has gone direct in your house of ambition, you can see the future more clearly. And with planet of ease, Venus, about to enter your optimistic ninth house of taking chances, you’ll be more ready than ever to get rolling. Just don’t forget that the devil is in the details so pay close attention to them between the 4th and the 12th.

"
3 january 2017,cancer,"Green lights ahead! Charming Venus enters your free-wheeling, optimistic house of going for it. Over the next four weeks you’ll be mighty tempted to take some chances on things that you may have been skeptical about before, maybe even fearful. This old saying applies: you can’t reach a new destination unless you’re willing to set sail and leave the shore. Bon voyage, Cancer!

"
4 january 2017,cancer,"The new year is under way and you’re going to be one of the most motivated signs to make things happen. It’s a smart move today to revisit projects you were working on (and prospective clients you were chasing) before the holidays, even back in October or November. Mercury backslides into your highly effective house of work assignments, bringing some of these initiatives back to life. If you’re looking for a new gig you might want to reach out to colleagues you used to work with to see if they know of any openings. This window will close by the 12th, so make haste.

"
5 january 2017,cancer,"Today is not the day to rock the boat, either at home or the office. With the Moon swinging past maverick Uranus in the most authoritative part of your chart, you may be tempted to try to take control of a situation that’s gotten out of hand, or worse, pull rank. It could backfire today, but not on Saturday when the Sun and Pluto meet up. Your powers of persuasion will be based more on logic than emotion and you’ll be able to get your point across successfully.

"
6 january 2017,cancer,"You’re becoming more fired up than ever to get organized and knock some things off your to-do list, and today you could become even more motivated. But now it’s not just about tying up loose ends—it’s about going after some of your bigger goals. Which is the way it should be, Cancer! The full moon on the 12th falls in your sign, wrapping up the past so that you can move on. Matters of the heart especially can take a big leap forward, so get ready.

"
7 january 2017,cancer,"You’re in an awesome position to join forces with someone who’s a mover and shaker in business. A fortuitous meeting today between Pluto and the Sun could introduce you to someone who shares your aspirations in business, or take an existing alliance to a much more prosperous level. But this important planetary meeting can also affect your love life in a big way, as it takes place in your house of serious romance too! Singles could meet a new flame and attached Cancers could enjoy more soulful interchanges. This energy will last for awhile, so keep your eyes open!

"
8 january 2017,cancer,"If one of your 2017 resolutions is to become more organized, today’s the day to take action! Mercury resumes direct motion in your sixth house of efficiency and good habits. If you need some help at the office or home, it’s also a smart time to consider hiring someone, even if they’re part time. Red tape and slacker co-workers may ease up a bit too, but you may have to take some action to achieve this. That’s OK–with Thursday’s full moon in your sign, you’ll be more than ready to give people a ration of whoop ass.

"
9 january 2017,cancer,"First the good news. Motivator Mars and inspirational Neptune are both in the most adventurous part of your chart, helping to boost your optimism as you make grand plans for the future. Now for the warning: your intuition is off today, or your confidence may be taking a hit for some reason. This could extend into tomorrow so the smartest thing that you can do is to rely on facts and logic, not making any key decisions. That will change on Thursday, though, with the full moon in your sign. Patience.

"
10 january 2017,cancer,"You may need to take control over situations that are going off the rails, whether they’re at work, home or within a group activity. With a full moon arriving this Thursday in your sign you’re not in the mood for anyone’s nonsense and stalling tactics. Try to be as diplomatic as possible though, because maverick Uranus may push you to use a bit too much force.

"
11 january 2017,cancer,"You’re definitely in a good place when it comes to teamwork, whether that means sharing responsibilities with a lover, business partner, co-workers or members of a group you’re involved with. Furthermore, with dynamic Mars in Pisces, you’re able to see the bigger picture and point it out to others with ease. However, the people around you may be more than willing to let you do all the work, perhaps resorting to poor-little-me routines—or on the flip side, acting like domineering divas. With tomorrow’s full moon in Cancer, these folks had better snap out of it, stat. You’re not a mule, Cancer—don’t act like one.

"
12 january 2017,cancer,"The full moon today is in your sign, Cancer, making this the perfect time to wrap up loose ends or see a plan that you’ve been working on come to a happy conclusion. However, it’s surrounded by other planets tugging and pulling on each other, making you feel as though you can’t keep everyone happy. Your career or classwork may leave you with little time for your family or vice versa. Just take one day at a time. A happy Venus-Neptune aspect suggests that you take a much needed vacation, so start planning it.

"
13 january 2017,cancer,"Yesterday’s dreamy full moon in your sign may have set your desires racing as you ponder the year ahead. It was accompanied by a sweet meeting between two of the most romantic and luxe planets in the solar system, Venus and Neptune. This is definitely the time to dream big, but it’s also essential to keep it real. With the Moon in one of the most practical places in your chart this weekend, don’t lose sight of the nuts-and-bolts work that needs to be accomplished.

"
14 january 2017,cancer,"The planets are shining their light on your closest partnerships, so expect things to heat up in the weeks ahead—in a good way! Mercury has just entered your commitment sector, enabling you to hold serious discussions with your amour, business partner or key client. Financial discussions can especially go well after next Thursday when the Sun enters Aquarius. There seem to be some matters that need to be resolved, though, and they deal with your level of comfort and security within the relationship. The energy over the next week is perfect for making progress.

"
15 january 2017,cancer,"My way or the highway? That could be your attitude, thanks to the recent full moon in your sign. But it’s not wise to let it show with a Moon-Venus opposition today. Others may not take too kindly to being pushed around. Keep an open mind about opinions that are different than yours–you might learn something valuable.

"
16 january 2017,cancer,"Lines of communication open today with a pleasant Moon-Pluto aspect. Your relationships with certain people are going through a transformative phase and it may be time to talk about what you’s like to experience and where the connection is going. This holds true for personal alliances as well as business ones, so make the decision to work well with others.

"
17 january 2017,cancer,"It may sound paradoxical, but sometimes in order to have greater security and comfort you need to take a risk. Planetary influences over the next week will be pushing you out of your comfort zone a bit, which could create unease today. But it won’t last long. Tomorrow your eyes could be opened up to some new opportunities.

"
18 january 2017,cancer,"There is definitely an air of expansion around you, Cancer. The cosmos is pushing you to grow, so consider taking a class, attending a seminar, hooking up with a mentor or joining a group of like-minded people. Even romance can improve with a change in attitude. Be more willing to accept another person’s faults and circumstances, as long as you maintain your self-esteem in the process.

"
20 january 2017,cancer,"Sweet, sexy love! The Sun just entered Aquarius, your eighth house of intimacy and bonding. Over the next four weeks you can learn so much more about your lover and enjoy some steamy romps in the boudoir while you’re at it. This is a soulful house, not the sector of quick flings. So singles, be on the lookout—a soulmate could be out there waiting for you.

"
21 january 2017,cancer,"The next week is an auspicious time to work on partnership issues, which includes business alliances. You should especially be looking at joint assets, such as investments and savings, or company revenues if you’re involved in a business partnership. Your money situation can improve dramatically in the weeks ahead, especially after the new moon on the 27th. But in order to see progress you need to get a snapshot as to where you are right now.

"
22 january 2017,cancer,"Famed author Sean Covey has stated, “we become what we repeatedly do”, and this holds true for you today, Cancer. A sparkling Sun-Moon connection asks you to examine the routines you go through every day, especially where your physical and emotional health are concerned. This Friday’s new moon in Aquarius is the perfect time to begin a new habit or two that will lead to a happier, more vibrant you.

"
23 january 2017,cancer,"You can do your best work alone today, and it’s advisable that you do. Other people around you may be too confused or full of themselves to be counted on for the straight story. With rational and disciplined Saturn by your side, you’ll have the good sense to see through their bluster and the desire to power through your tasks both at home and at the office.

"
24 january 2017,cancer,"With structured, serious Saturn in your sixth house of efficiency you may feel as though you can take on an endless list of chores and obligations. Fueling this fire is Neptune, planet of inspiration, encouraging you to think big (as in—world domination). You’re going to have to make a short list of what’s important and needs to be accomplished first. When aggressive Mars enters your house of ambition this weekend, you may try to achieve so much that you’ll flame out. Prioritize.

"
25 january 2017,cancer,"Got some issues to work out with a lover? Then today’s the day to open up the lines of communication. The passionate Moon is in your favor, swinging past verbal Mercury and change-inducing Pluto in the heavens. Considering that this Friday’s new moon is in your house of sexuality and intimacy, you certainly don’t want to be dragging any unfinished business into the future—or your boudoir.

"
26 january 2017,cancer,"Hmmm…contentment and guarantees, or taking a risk? A helpful Jupiter-Venus aspect asks if you’re playing things too safe. It doesn’t matter if it’s in love, business, travel, or friendships—it’s time to spread your wings a bit and fly. Tomorrow’s new moon in your house of passion will only add gasoline to this fire, so change is coming—ready or not!

"
27 january 2017,cancer,"Ready to open up a hot new chapter in intimacy? (Who the hell isn’t?) You’re in luck, Cancer, as today’s new moon falls in your house of bonding both emotionally and sexually. Couples, it seems that you need to focus more on your love life than the food shopping, the kids and the stress you’re bringing home from the office. Singles, you’re in a good place to meet someone who would really qualify as a soulmate, if you would ever take some time from your busy schedule to get out there and meet someone.

"
28 january 2017,cancer,"You are in one heck of a good place to pull in some serious coin, Cancer. Today high octane Mars enters your career and ambition sector, setting the stage for progress. Yesterday a new moon occurred in your sector of financial strength. Not only will your confidence rise, your passion for succeeding will too. Don’t be surprised if someone wants to partner with you or represent you in some way.

"
29 january 2017,cancer,"How passionate and strong is your romance? That’s the question with today’s Pluto-Mercury meet up. The planets are encouraging you to take a more authoritative role in partnerships, which also includes business alliances. This doesn’t mean being pushy or obnoxious, but making sure that your voice is heard as well as your emotions and ideas being respected.

"
30 january 2017,cancer,"You’re stepping into a much more commanding position, Cancer, now that Mars is in your house of ambition and success.  And today the passionate Moon meets up with inspirational Neptune in the most visionary part of your chart. Toss out old ideas about what you thought was possible and look at your life through a new lens.

"
31 january 2017,cancer,"Your closest relationships are in the spotlight, and you can make a lot of progress when it comes to understanding your loved ones better, not to mention important business alliances. But it’s imperative that you don’t come on too strong, a possibility with a tense Mercury-Uranus square. It may take others a while to catch up with your view of things; give them time.

"
2 february 2017,cancer,"Afraid to speak up? The cosmos urges you to find your voice. There’s no point in going through life keeping everything bottled up. You have an opinion and it counts. There’s an old saying from the business world: you don’t ask, you don’t get. The same holds true for your personal life, so let others know where you’re coming from.

"
3 february 2017,cancer,"Put a ring on it? Venus enters your tenth house of traditional love for an unusually long stay, blessing romantic unions. Singles, you stand a good chance of meeting someone new, especially around Valentine’s Day when long term Saturn could find you a honey in your line of work. Just know that Venus retrogrades here on March 4th, so all Cancers need to make an effort to take care of romantic issues before then, which includes your own fears and hangups.

"
5 february 2017,cancer,"Hold off before diving head first into some kind of enterprise, whether it’s applying to college, taking a new job, getting married or traveling to Timbuktu. From your chart it appears that you’re overlooking key details, or that you don’t have the best habits or routines in place to carry you forward. That will change quickly, however, once Friday’s lunar eclipse occurs in one of the most structured parts of your chart. Not only will you get your act together, your dignity and self esteem will rise in the process.

"
6 february 2017,cancer,"Stop and smell the roses? That’s what you should be doing over the next four months as Jupiter retrogrades in your house of comfort and family ties. You can’t be working all the time, Cancer, and you need to recharge your batteries. Allow the pace of life to slow down as you catch up with your loved ones. Don’t forget to book some time just for yourself: a massage, reading a good book before you go to bed at night, or spending time in nature. You’re going to need the rest as Friday’s lunar eclipse falls in your income sector, making you motivated to earn more. Balance is the key.

"
7 february 2017,cancer,"Felling emo? You might be, considering that verbal Mercury just entered your soulful eighth house. Intense feelings may bubble up to the surface over the next three weeks, but that’s happening for a reason. It’s time to sort them out so that you can develop a greater sense of internal comfort and security. This Friday’s lunar eclipse will only intensify your desire to build a strong, serene foundation.
 

"
8 february 2017,cancer,"Tread cautiously around business partners, big clients and bosses as the emotional Moon may cause you to be far more vocal than is good for you. Someone in a position of rank may do or say something that sets you off, but keep calm and carry on. Thursday and Friday are much better days for speaking your mind. Heck, you can even impress these folks then and see more cash coming your way down the road.

"
9 february 2017,cancer,"A smart money-making strategy could reveal itself over the next three days, although you can help matters along by doing some brainstorming and research. If you’re considering finding a job elsewhere, this is an excellent day to put out some feelers, as is tomorrow. The lunar eclipse on Friday falls in your income sector and it’s a honey. There could be a shakeup at the office, or a sudden decision on your part to make a big move–such as switching industries.

"
10 february 2017,cancer,"Ah, the sweet sound of crisp green Benjamins rustling between your fingertips. You’re the envy of the zodiac, Cancer, now that a series of eclipses begins tonight in your income sector. Between now and 2019 your earnings can grow exponentially, provided that you put in the effort. Stellar aspects surrounding tonight’s lunation are helpful in landing new assignments or even a new position. Erratic Uranus is acting up (in your favor!), indicating that a deal or job offer could come your way that you weren’t expecting. Eclipses can be felt for six months, so hustle between now and August 7th.

"
11 february 2017,cancer,"Keep your antennae up today, Cancer. Last night’s lunar eclipse in Leo was all about making more money, and today you might hear about an opportunity that will help make that happen. Your aspects for landing new clients or a promotion are excellent, as is developing new income streams if you’re self employed. This isn’t a quick payoff of some chump change; we’re talking good money over the long haul.

"
12 february 2017,cancer,"Need to make a decision? Then wait a few days as confusing Neptune is swirling its mist. It’s also a smart move to keep your mouth shut today for the same reason. You run the risk of making a statement that’s based more on emotions than facts, which can come back to bite you later on. Tuesday is a far more practical and strategic time to voice your opinions.

"
13 february 2017,cancer,"Try a little tenderness. Someone close to you may need a delicate touch, and you might not be able to approach them the same way you usually do. But you won’t have to tiptoe around forever. This aspect passes quickly and by tomorrow you’ll be able to tell it like it is.

"
14 february 2017,cancer,"With the Sun in your house of passion and libido, and Mars and Venus in your take-charge sector, you’re definitely not in “shrinking violet” mode, Cancer. No, this is more about being lusty, loving life and sharing it with a person who also knows how to live la vida loca. But with Jupiter in your warm and fuzzy domestic sector you’ll also want to nest. Seek balance.

"
15 february 2017,cancer,"Reminiscing about the past, especially fond family memories, is the order of the day. The cosmos reminds you that there is more to life than work, something that you need to be mindful of with aggressive Mars in your ambition sector. Start carving out more quality time for your family, lover or just for yourself. Don’t worry, you’ll still have time left for going after your goals.

"
16 february 2017,cancer,"Working with others to make progress is the name of the game over the next week. Just don’t appear too anxious to seal a deal, or push others to make a decision. Your confidence speaks volumes. The people around you will sense it and come around to your way of thinking.

"
17 february 2017,cancer,"Feeling emo? It wouldn’t be surprising, especially when it comes to your relationships with loved ones. The Moon is churning up your feelings and you might not be seeing things in a realistic light. This will change by Monday, when you will suddenly feel more in control of your alliances, but for now don’t make any major decisions.

"
18 february 2017,cancer,"Is it time to expand your knowledge base? Now that the Sun is in your house of learning and expanding your horizons, you might be thinking about signing up for a class or getting licensed in a new trade. Maybe a trip abroad would provide you with a fresh perspective, or reading part of a good book every night before you go to bed. Even the most talented CEOs, surgeons and artists are always perfecting their skills. You don’t stop learning until you die.

"
20 february 2017,cancer,"Brainiac Uranus is lively today, stirring things up in your career sector. You could stumble upon a smart way to earn more money or develop greater financial stability. Just don’t expect everyone around you to be as excited as you are, especially on Wednesday. That’s OK. From your chart it doesn’t look like you need anyone’s approval or help. You’re on a roll, so don’t let anyone or anything slow you down.

"
21 february 2017,cancer,"“Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love.” So sang Phil Collins back in the day (and he was covering the Mindbenders’ version from 1964!). Well, that’s what the cosmos has in store for you Cancer–a shagadelic, groovy kind of love that comes with a soulmate attached. That includes you too, singles, so don’t despair. Today’s trine will help you, along with the upcoming solar eclipse on Sunday.

"
22 february 2017,cancer,"Where there’s a will, there’s a way. Assertive Mars is powering its way through your house of ambition, usually a beneficial situation. Today, however, there could be pushback against your forward momentum from someone who seems determined to stand in your way. The key is to maintain your authority and progress without going bats**t on this individual. Temper, temper.

"
23 february 2017,cancer,"With so much activity going on in your big-picture thinking sector, you could be losing sight of the details that need to be handled. Chunk down larger projects into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Your passion will rise and your stress will decrease.

"
24 february 2017,cancer,"Nothing of any value has been achieved without passion, and the dedication and zeal you bring to important aspects of your life will pay off. A happy lunar aspect helps you dig deep into that wellspring of inspiration so that you can pursue your goals with well-directed intensity.

"
26 february 2017,cancer,"As Eleanor Roosevelt said, “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams”. Truer words were never spoken as this sentiment applies to you, Cancer. A solar eclipse in your visionary ninth house sets the stage for six months worth of progress. Inspirational Neptune is in an excellent angle to help you, and shock jock Uranus may deliver some unexpected but good news in the days ahead.

"
27 february 2017,cancer,"It’s time to kick ass! A megawatt meeting between aggressive Mars and genius Uranus in your ambition sector will get you going at warp speed. Your family and personal life may suffer, but hey–you’ve got places to go and people to meet.
 
 

"
28 february 2017,cancer,"In no mood for people playing power games? Whether it’s a lover or a business contact, you’re not going to be willing to let people steamroll right over you. A subtle yet surprising use of force at your end could put them on notice that you’re not to be trifled with. With Mars in your success sector, you can’t waste your time with people who want to throw up roadblocks.

"
1 march 2017,cancer,"If there was ever a day to think big, it’s today, Cancer! A superb meeting of the Sun and Neptune will spike your creativity and optimism, not to mention the motivation to go after your passions. Create a vision board, find a mentor, and sign up for a class. The more open you are to new ideas and techniques the faster your progress will be.

"
3 march 2017,cancer,"Mixed signals? Try to reach an agreement today with a lover or business partner as to the direction you’re heading in. Otherwise control battles may erupt over the next four weeks. Venus will be retrograding in your house of authority on Saturday, which might challenge your self-confidence.

"
4 march 2017,cancer,"Keep your cool, Cancer! Slowdowns may occur in your career as profitable Venus goes retrograde in your ambition sector for the next month. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t make progress. You’re actually in a super spot for coming up with some interesting ideas that could take your career and income to a higher level. They may take a bit longer than you’d like, but start working on them. After the 13th momentum will build.

"
5 march 2017,cancer,"Practicality rules with structured Saturn telling you to draw up an action plan for your ambitions. It’s not enough to dream it, talk about it or create vision boards–you need to get real about timelines, resources you’ll need and your mindset. Fortunately assertive Mars is in your house of ambition, lighting a fire under you to get moving.

"
6 march 2017,cancer,"An idea that seems a little “out there” may actually work, Cancer. Brilliant little Mercury and the fiery Sun meet up in the most original, free-thinking part of your chart, so some interesting brainstorms could come your way. Considering that assertive Mars enters your house of teamwork this Thursday, you might consider crowdfunding or collaborating with others to turn an idea into reality.

"
7 march 2017,cancer,"Stepping into your power is in the cards today, but people around you might make a fuss. What’s their problem? Are they used to getting their way? Oh well! They’ve been getting away with this for far too long. With Venus now retrograde in your house of authority, it’s time for you to consider the ways in which you’ve given away your power in the past.

"
8 march 2017,cancer,"Teaming up with other people never looked so good, Cancer! Whether it’s for love, business, a charity, or friendship, this week is super for making connections. The best part is that the people who will enter your world will be more open minded and optimistic than the folks you’ve known in the past. Get out there and mingle.

"
9 march 2017,cancer,"It takes a village! That should be your mantra over the next six weeks as Mars has just entered your house of networking and camaraderie. This is an excellent time to join forces with like-minded people, whether it’s for a charitable cause or your career. Seek the advice of savvy experts, and rub shoulders with movers and shakers. Group efforts can really pick up steam, but watch out for infighting and team players who seem to be more interested in their own agenda than the good of the group.

"
10 march 2017,cancer,"From your chart it appears that you need to think on more global terms, Cancer. Don’t set your sights too low. Instead, raise them! Today’s a good one for thinking and talking about earning more, but you’ll have to change your mindset first. Do things the same way you’ve always done them and you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.

"
11 march 2017,cancer,"You’re about to enter a phase in which you can relax more, emotionally that is. Stressful situations and dramas will start to recede, and you could start feeling that today. Tomorrow’s full moon falls in one of the most social parts of your chart, so start making plans for brunch, cocktails, movie dates and neighborhood get togethers. Travel is also on the planets’ agenda.

"
12 march 2017,cancer,"Tonight’s full moon could bring news that you’ve been waiting for, Cancer. It also sets the stage for some awesome strategy sessions. But a difficult Mercury-Saturn aspect warns that you don’t go too big and bold too fast. Take your time with your thesis, manuscript, website launch, relationship or exercise program. While it appears that you’ll be receiving the support of people around you, you still need to take baby steps and do things right.

"
13 march 2017,cancer,"It’s time to freshen up your image on the career front, Cancer. Mercury has just entered your house of ambition, so polish up your resume, portfolio or thesis. If you’re self employed consider what message you want to send to potential clients and consider whether you have branded yourself appropriately. Start hustling now, because once the Sun enters Aries on the 20th things are going to pick up speed.

"
14 march 2017,cancer,"Afraid of rocking the boat? You could be as your ruler, the Moon, is in engaged in a few tense aspects. It appears that someone—a boss, ex, client or lover—is trying to throw their weight around, and that you may be concerned about standing up to them. Do it. With the Sun about to enter the most authoritative part of your chart next week, you don’t have to take anyone’s garbage.

"
15 march 2017,cancer,"You’re just about to enter a highly productive (and possibly stressful) time in which you can make terrific headway with your career and other ambitions. Today the planets tell you to slow down and make plans to hang out with your friends. This is more than having fun and sharing confidences; the people in your world could shape your path in the years to come, in unusual and positive ways.

"
17 march 2017,cancer,"First the good news: the Moon and Neptune in the most creative parts of your chart are sparking up all sorts of bright ideas. Now for the downside: you need to get real about them. How much money will they cost? Are there enough hours in a day to complete them? If not, so you need to delegate or hire someone? If you need the cooperation of others, will they sign on? This is true whether you’re looking to get engaged or invent the next Spanx. When the Sun enters Aries next week you’ll be able to figure it all out.

"
18 march 2017,cancer,"Get ready, Cancer. One of the most prosperous chapters of 2017 is about to open on Monday when the Sun enters your ambitious tenth house of success. Today an auspicious meeting of Mercury and Venus gets things started a bit early. Use this positive energy to come up with fresh goals and ideas as to how to turn them into reality.

"
19 march 2017,cancer,"An extremely active period is about to begin tomorrow when the Sun enters Aries, the most ambitious part of your chart. Today the Moon conjuncts Saturn, telling you that in order to achieve success in any  area of your life that you need to toss out ineffective routines and time wasters (which could include people). Fortunately Saturn is the planet of logic and discipline so whatever changes you make should get locked in with ease.

"
20 march 2017,cancer,"Your career catches fire now that the Sun is in Aries, your tenth house of ambition. Actually, any big goal that’s on your mind can get a boost as long as you’re willing to put in the grunt work. Start planning and researching, then get ready to launch at the time of the new moon on the 28th.

"
21 march 2017,cancer,"Your head and your heart could be working at cross purposes today and for the rest of the week, for that matter. It may be difficult to make decisions about key issues. This is definitely a time when you need to create a short list of what’s important. Otherwise you’ll be torn and matters that need to be settled will drag on.

"
22 march 2017,cancer,"With both the authoritative Sun and magnetic Venus in your career house you should have no trouble in impressing higher-ups with your know how. Today is a good time to initiate conversations, but wait until next week to really get going with initiatives. A tense T-square tomorrow and Friday could create mixed signals and power struggles.

"
23 march 2017,cancer,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Cancer, something that will become apparent with a tough Mercury-Pluto square. Someone may place demands on your time and they could be pushy about it. Remember that with the Sun in the most ambitious part of your chart that you need to take care of #1. There’s nothing wrong with drawing boundaries.

"
24 march 2017,cancer,"You’re quite an ambitious individual these days, what with the Sun and Mercury blazing a path through your house of success. But you could be hampered today by the demands of others, especially family. It’s also possible that the demands of your job are such that you feel guilty about not spending enough time with the family unit, not to mention relaxing on your own. Well, your success streak ain’t gonna stop anytime soon, especially with next week’s new moon in this sector. But you really do need some down time, so try to schedule it.

"
25 march 2017,cancer,"Making headway in a romance is a strong possibility with a happy Sun-Venus connection. You and a lover may finally reach a decision as to where you’re headed. Singles, you could meet a stable, mature (and possibly older) person who is well established both financially and socially. This is no time for fly-by-night love affairs or partners who can’t commit. Not satisfied in love? Then Tuesday’s new moon could prompt you to move on.

"
26 march 2017,cancer,"A sudden burst of inspiration could hit you to go after a goal, or to switch up the way you’ve been trying to achieve one already. What’s up? Inspirational Neptune is on the job, sending you insight from the heavens. If you need to seek advice from a mentor, or think that attending a seminar might help, get moving. From your chart it appears that other people will be crucially important when it comes to achieving your aims.

"
27 march 2017,cancer,"You’re the most goal oriented sign of the zodiac these days thanks to planets occupying your ambitious tenth house, and today is loaded with positive energy. Do you love what you do? If so, fine. If not, you’re still in luck as profitable Venus wants to show you the best way to follow your bliss. Tomorrow’s new moon kicks off a wonderful phase which could bring results by the time of your birthday.

"
28 march 2017,cancer,"You’re on fire, Cancer! With the Sun, Moon, Venus and Uranus all packed into your ambition sector, there will be no shortage of ideas and goals to pursue on your part. If finding new love or improving an existing relationship is on that list, you’re in luck. Today’s new moon is well aspected by amorous Venus. Over the next six months your romantic situation could change rather nicely, provided you’re willing to put in some effort.

"
29 march 2017,cancer,"If you’ve been pushing yourself too hard—and from your chart it appears like that’s the case—your health may be taking a beating. A strong Mercury-Saturn link tells you to develop better habits, such as drinking more water, eating more vegetables, going to bed earlier and working out more frequently. Don’t take your health for granted; there’s only a finite amount of energy we have each day and it can get depleted.

"
30 march 2017,cancer,"Optimistic Jupiter is encouraging you to seek peace of mind, especially at home. Your relationships with kids, a lover and family members may need some mending, but today is probably not the best for expecting results. A tense Jupiter-Pluto square could bring out a power struggle in which one of you tries to outmaneuver the other, with hurt feelings resulting. Mercury enters the teamwork sector tomorrow, though, so over the next few weeks you should be able to work things out.

"
31 march 2017,cancer,"Technology rules for you over the next few weeks, thanks to Mercury joining Mars in the eleventh house of the digital world. You can knock ‘em dead on social media, posting videos, developing a website or kicking off an internet-based marketing campaign. Get moving now as Mercury retrogrades here on April 9th.

"
1 april 2017,cancer,"You’ve been pushing hard with your career and other ambitions, Cancer, but you can expect some relief tomorrow when Venus retrogrades into a far more relaxed location. Plan a vacation or some exciting weekend options for the upcoming month. Sign up for a class or seminar that’s just for fun. Daydream and then take some actions on the “fantasies” that pop into your head. By mid-April you’ll be rested and ready to socialize more.

"
2 april 2017,cancer,"Any time you’re trying to get a plan off the ground you need to be cognizant that along the journey you’ll have to adjust things. Nothing ever goes exactly to plan, so flexibility and the openness to change your viewpoint and strategy are key. Over the next two weeks you’ll need to revise a goal, project or even an opinion. Venus has just begun to retrograde in your house of learning big lessons, so pay attention.

"
3 april 2017,cancer,"Your creative mojo is off the charts today with a superb Moon-Neptune connection. You’ll have the ability to think big and bold—but that doesn’t mean that others around you will be able to appreciate your genius. A boss or client especially may resistant to your ideas. Actually they may have a point; with Saturn about to retrograde it’s not necessarily that the idea is bad, but it needs to be fleshed out in greater detail.

"
4 april 2017,cancer,"Unexpected criticism from a boss, client, parent or other authority figure could rattle your confidence today, Cancer. The trouble is that you may react emotionally with the passionate Moon in your sign. This energy continues into the weekend, so put on your seatbelt. The good news is that the full moon on the 11th will help you sort out your feelings and put some of this drama to rest.

"
5 april 2017,cancer,"Don’t be so tough on yourself, Cancer. A part of you wants to follow the rules and maintain perfect habits while another part of you wants to break free. The good news is that you’ll be able to do both with a smart Moon-Neptune connection. Don’t kid yourself–even people who seem like free spirits have routines and habits that enable them to live life a little larger than everyone else.

"
6 april 2017,cancer,"Take a deep breath and slow down, Cancer. Structured Saturn is now moving backward in your house of productivity, forcing you to examine your methods when it comes to work flow both at home and the office. It’s time to get a handle on unfinished projects, overflowing e-mail accounts and inefficient methods. But if you put in the effort and make changes, you’ll live a far less stressful lifestyle.

"
7 april 2017,cancer,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Cancer, something that you need to be mindful of. A tense Sun-Jupiter opposition will remind you of that fact. Between your career demands and those of your family, you appear to be spread too thin. And what about taking some time for yourself? Slow down, schedule some free time and examine your priorities.

"
8 april 2017,cancer,"Practical matters must be addressed this weekend, regardless as to what your romantic partner or pals may want to do. You may need to come down hard on folks who’d rather play than get things done, but watch that you don’t push too hard. The approaching full moon in your sector of comfort and domesticity is making you aware that routines need to be followed so that life can run more smoothly.

"
9 april 2017,cancer,"Tech success could become stalled as Mercury retrogrades today in your digital sector. Hold off (if you can) on launching a website, app, social media blitz or internet marketing campaign. The same is true for online dating—a dicey proposition between now and the 20th when Mercury goes direct! But the delays can help you if you take the time to perfect everything that you’re putting out there on the internet.

"
10 april 2017,cancer,"Your self-confidence gets a boost with a serene Moon-Jupiter connection. You’re learning that your dignity and self esteem are not dependent upon the opinions of others, even those who are closest to your heart. Tomorrow’s full moon will really drive this point home as you may decide to cut ties with those who seem determined to put you down.

"
11 april 2017,cancer,"Creating a balance between helping loved ones but maintaining your own space may not be easy, but it’s worth it. The full moon in the most emotional part of your chart will encourage you to develop a more deep seated sense of security. However, family and loved ones may be tugging at you with their issues. You must figure out how to maintain your own peace while helping them.

"
12 april 2017,cancer,"Is there something that you’ve been dying to try or do–but something held you back? The planets are encouraging you to take a bold risk. Release your fears or worries about what other people will think. When Venus goes direct this weekend, nothing will get in your way.

"
13 april 2017,cancer,"With the Moon in your house of talent, now is a good time to develop yours. Sign up for a class, find a mentor, read a book or model someone else’s success. A superb Sun-Uranus meeting on Friday is just the ticket for taking a chance on some bold new aspirations. Make sure that you’ve got the chops to go after them.

"
14 april 2017,cancer,"Recent planetary aspects may have brought up roadblocks when it came to accomplishing your plans, but that all changes within the next 48 hours. A super energetic meeting of the authoritative Sun and innovative Uranus in your ambition sector will spark fresh ideas, along with a renewed drive to get things done. Sometimes ya just gotta break the rules and start doing things differently, and that’s what the cosmos is suggesting you try!

"
16 april 2017,cancer,"They say that if you aim for the moon and you miss, you’ll still land among the stars. That phrase is perfect for you today as a happy Venus-Mars connection urges you to take a bold risk by thinking out of the box. Venus provides you with the vision and Mars the motivation. When the Sun enters Taurus in a few days your momentum will only increase.

"
17 april 2017,cancer,"Trying to close a deal or land a position with more responsibility? Then today’s your day, Cancer. The authoritative Sun in your ambition sector puts you in the driver’s seat. New clients or projects could come your way, thanks to the hard work you’ve been putting in lately. When the Sun enters Taurus this week it sets up a four-week period in which networking is the way to go.

"
18 april 2017,cancer,"Controlling your emotions is sometimes wise, but not necessarily today. Your loved ones need to hear how much you care about them. Try to mend fences now if there are outstanding issues, because once Pluto retrogrades on Thursday old resentments and problems will come bubbling to the surface.

"
19 april 2017,cancer,"Who’s got your back? That’s the big question as the powerful Sun enters your house of camaraderie and networking. But with Pluto and Mercury about to retrograde in the houses that deal with romantic partners and business associates, you’ll need to tread a careful path to suss who has your best interests at heart. Fortunately Mars enters your house of intuition this Friday, so it shouldn’t be too hard to do!
 
 

"
20 april 2017,cancer,"Trust issues, power plays, head games—if these are present in your romance they need to go bye-bye. The same holds true for singles who have burned in the past with these crummy vibes. Strong man Pluto retrogrades in your commitment sector, asking you to examine where you give up your power—or where you might be abusing it. Over the next few months do some inner work and release the memories associated with past mistakes, and put people on notice that you’re not going to be their doormat.

"
21 april 2017,cancer,"If you’re smart, Cancer, you’ll start to slow down and take better care of yourself. Mars has just entered the quietest, most nurturing part of your chart, demanding that you soothe your rattled nerves and carve out some “me” time. It’s also wise to take a good long look at the path you’re on, both in your career and romance. Pluto and Mercury went retrograde yesterday in these sectors. If you have pent up anger or fears in these areas you need to release them and move on.

"
22 april 2017,cancer,"Sometimes ya just gotta get the grunt work done, Cancer, and this weekend is the time to attend to it…no matter how much you want to play! Laundry won’t wash itself, nor will the basement get cleaned up on its own. Its also a smart time to tackle work and e-mails that have been piling up at the office. Don’t worry. Next Tuesday’s new moon falls in your house of camaraderie, so there are plenty of dinners out, cocktails and movie nights in your future.

"
23 april 2017,cancer,"If your love life has become dull, or if you feel that life in general has become a snooze, it’s time to shake things up. A happy Venus-Moon meet-up in the heavens urges you to get out of a rut and try new or exciting things that will make your heart sing. Mars just entered your twelfth house, the place where we take good care of ourselves and regroup. Get out there and have some fun this weekend.

"
24 april 2017,cancer,"Hustle. That’s the word o’ the day, Cancer. Mercury in your career house forms a fabulous angle with stable Saturn, indicating that initiatives that you start today will have some serious long term potential. Mercury is  retrograde, so you can’t expect cash, new clients and job offers to pour in right away. The key is to get some new things started and give them time to grow.

"
25 april 2017,cancer,"Take this job and shove it? Erratic Uranus is acting up in your career sector today, sparking changes that you may not have seen coming. But this is a good thing as the genius planet is forming a terrific angle with Saturn. You could make the decision to find employment elsewhere, apply for a promotion or start your own company. A new client or project with excellent long term potential might land on your desk. Get ready to run with whatever happens as Venus cruises into your career sector on Friday.

"
26 april 2017,cancer,"It’s not what you know, it’s who you know, and that’s the message behind today’s new moon, Cancer. While you’re being encouraged to make more plans to party with the tribe, you should be working your contact list for other reasons. Profitable Venus is about to enter your house of career and ambition, so reach out to former co-workers and bosses. Find a mentor or coach who can provide you with fresh ideas about how to achieve all of your goals, not just those that are work-related. May can be a big month if you start connecting now.

"
27 april 2017,cancer,"Considering that yesterday’s new moon fell in your house of networking, you should be looking to meet as many new people as possible, not to mention connecting with existing contacts. Today’s perfect for talking about forming a business collaboration that will take you far. Don’t be shy about reaching out to folks who are movers and shakers, people whom you think might be “above” your level. They may be more accessible than you realize.

"
28 april 2017,cancer,"Need to have a serious talk with someone about the future? Then hop to it as magnetic Venus just entered your house of structure and authority. This is no time to sit around and hope that things will come together by themselves. With Venus on the scene you won’t have to resort to threats or manipulation. Just be frank and let others know that you need an answer.

"
29 april 2017,cancer,"Routines, protocols,habits—they may all be getting on your nerves today! Chances are that you are not  going to want to stick to your diet, clean out the basement, food shop or anything else that screams of discipline. That’s because the emotional Moon is creating a mini rebellion against play-by-the-rules Saturn. But this passes quickly, so whether you decide to play hooky or not this weekend is entirely up to you.

"
30 april 2017,cancer,"New faces could come into your world this week provided you’re open to meeting new people. As a matter of fact the next three weeks are super for expanding your contact list, a bonus for your personal life as well as for business. Considering that profits planet Venus just entered your career sector, think about whom you can connect with. You might be surprised to discover that influential folks are willing to open doors for you.

"
1 may 2017,cancer,"Tread carefully around authority figures as the Moon squares unpredictable Uranus. They could be set off pretty easily and you certainly don’t want to be the person who provokes them. Even if you keep a low profile, a boss or muckety-muck (judge, cop, government official) could hurl some criticism or make unrealistic demands. Fortunately this is a short lived situation. Keep calm and carry on.

"
2 may 2017,cancer,"You’ll be able to breathe a sigh of relief soon, Cancer. Mercury is about to resume direct motion in your house of goals and career tomorrow, loosening up logjams and helping you proceed with greater confidence. But the cosmos throws you a bone today in the form of a profitable Moon-Mars connection. Quietly research some new options for increasing your income or starting your own business.

"
3 may 2017,cancer,"Vamanos! Surge forward with your plans and ambitions, Cancer—Mercury is now direct in this part of the sky. Your best path to success is to include other people in your plans rather than trying to go solo. With the Sun in your house of networking you should be working your contact list, attending seminars and parties and finding a savvy mentor who can help you. It doesn’t matter whether you’re looking for a new spouse or a new job: contacts count.

"
4 may 2017,cancer,"You may need to tiptoe around a love partner today or switch up your methods of communicating. The same holds true for bosses and authority figures. If you’re used to being straightforward, holding back information may be better. Always on the passive side? Then come on a little stronger, but carefully. There’s a time and place for everything and your job is to figure out the best MO for getting your point across.

"
5 may 2017,cancer,"If you’ve been at odds with a friend, lover or family member today’s the day to make amends. Your peace of mind is so important, thanks to serene Jupiter occupying one of the most emotional parts of your chart. If you don’t take care of matters they’ll just eat away at you, so why put yourself through that? Get it over and done with and feel better, about yourself and the other person.

"
6 may 2017,cancer,"Talk is cheap, Cancer. Stop talking about getting your body in shape. Quit saying that tomorrow you’ll start the diet. Of all the signs of the zodiac, your sign stands the best chance of getting fit and staying there. That’s because strict Saturn, the planet of maintaining discipline, has been in your house of wellness for some time now. Take advantage of this—it won’t be back for another 30 years!

"
7 may 2017,cancer,"You’re a home body by nature, and today’s Moon-Jupiter meet up is going to create the desire to nest at home. But adventure is calling also, thanks to glamorous Neptune in your travel sector. Start searching for exotic locations to visit. In the meantime, work on turning your home into a luxurious place to come back to at the end of a long day.

"
8 may 2017,cancer,"A battle may be brewing between your work responsibilities and your personal life, Cancer. A moody Moon-Mercury opposition today could prompt you to let someone have it. Think before you speak, especially if you’re considering venting at the boss or a key client. This energy builds as Wednesday approaches, by the way. But if it’s a lover who refuses to honor the effort you put in to your career, it may be time to set them straight.

"
9 may 2017,cancer,"There’s power in numbers and the planets are advising you to join forces with savvy folks rather than going it alone. A stellar Sun-Pluto aspect puts you in touch with movers and shakers, whether they’re from the business world, volunteerism or the social strata. Don’t be surprised if someone wants to partner with you (which includes marriage, dontcha know). If you think that hooking up with a mentor or coach is a smart move then start making inquiries.

"
10 may 2017,cancer,"Do you want your life to look like an episode of General Hospital  or The Guiding Light ?  No? Then you’re going to have to tread carefully, Cancer, as tonight’s full moon falls in the most dramatic part of your chart. Sure, this is also the house of romance, flirting, fun, culture and entertainment. But erratic Uranus is acting up, perhaps making you a little more demanding than usual. On the other hand, if you’re used to being a doormat this may be a good thing!

"
11 may 2017,cancer,"Establishing long term plans with your amour is the order of the day, Cancer. An auspicious Sun-Pluto trine helps the two of you get everything out in the open. You won’t be settling for table scraps either, so be prepared to speak openly about what you truly desire. Singles, this is a terrific aspect for meeting someone new, someone who can go the distance. And your options for meeting them are wide open: an introduction from a friend, online or bumping into someone in a public place.

"
12 may 2017,cancer,"Got something on your mind? Then get it out in the open, Cancer, as a superb Mars-Jupiter aspect helps you release pent up feelings. Singles, you may finally feel vulnerable enough to open up your heart and get involved with someone, important if you’ve been shying away for fear of getting hurt. Coupled up crabs can have some serious talk about the direction they’re heading in, especially when it comes to matters surrounding children (conceiving them, custody, adoption and so on) or housing. There’s a building feeling of optimism, so take it and run with it!

"
13 may 2017,cancer,"Sometimes you need to step back from your friendships and groups that you’re involved in so that you can see how you fit in to the grander scheme of things. Maybe you’ve outgrown certain relationships and it’s time to move on. Or you realize that you’re being taken for granted by the team at the office or your pals. If everyone comes running to you with their problems but can’t seem to be there when you need a shoulder to cry on, you need to wake up. But you may not need to part company: a serious talk may do the trick.

"
14 may 2017,cancer,"With so much planetary action in the deepest, most psychological part of your chart you may be wondering if you’re turning into a basket case. You’re not. But you are being encouraged to let go of mental kaka so that you can: (a) enjoy life more, which includes taking some interesting risks and (b) feel more content and serene while you’re having that fun. Don’t worry, with serious, logical Saturn in the most practical part of your chart you won’t do anything really stupid, and all of your work will get done.

"
15 may 2017,cancer,"Power struggles within a close relationship? Or maybe you just need to revise the roles you play or the responsibilities you share with someone, such as a spouse or business partner. With intelligent Mercury just about to enter your house of collaboration and networking, you need to make sure that you’re not taking on too much. There will be new people coming into your life, people with wisdom and influence. Make sure that you have the time and patience to connect with them.

"
16 may 2017,cancer,"Forging dynamic connections, becoming part of a new crew, socializing like mad—yup, it’s all possible now that chatty little Mercury is in your house of networking. Use this energy to expand your contact list. This sector also covers technology, so the next three weeks are super for getting a website ready for prime time, coding an app, preparing a social media campaign and even finding a lover online.

"
17 may 2017,cancer,"Facing up to your fears becomes a lot easier today with a sweet lunar aspect. Mark Twain famously said, “I’ve had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened.” The humorist was pointing out that we humans love to create mental dramas when often there’s nothing to get worked up about. Even if there is, how does excessive fear and worrying help?

"
18 may 2017,cancer,"Feeling crabby, Cancer? You might! The two most optimistic planets, Venus and Jupiter, are at odds in your houses of home and career. There simply may not be enough hours in the day to handle the responsibilities from both. If you’ve taken on too much, or you’re the go-to person, it may be time to let others know that you need some help. Cut back on some of your commitments. Carve out time for yourself while you’re at it.

"
19 may 2017,cancer,"They say that rules are meant to be broken. In your case, Cancer, you should be rethinking the way you go about your daily grind at work, not to mention your career path. A superb meeting between maverick Uranus and disciplined Saturn urges you to think in a fresh new way. Are you in the right occupation? If now, what can you do now to make a change? How can you streamline your tasks at the office? With Uranus involved, change can happen quickly. A job offer may suddenly come your way, or you might make a fast decision about a career change. Perhaps you need to set your sights on bigger clients or deals. Consider your options.

"
21 may 2017,cancer,"Your motivation to gain control over situations in your life increases today as the Moon is in one of the most authoritative and confident parts of your chart. But first you have to take out the trash. The mental trash, that is. This week’s new moon is a game changer as it occurs in the sector that governs emotional closure and healing. Do the inner work before embarking on the next phase of your life.

"
22 may 2017,cancer,"Your ability to make some well thought out decisions about your career goes up as profitable Venus conjuncts the Moon. But don’t rush anything as this Thursday’s new moon falls in the most reflective part of your chart. You may decide to cut ties with existing clients or business partners in order to make room for some new ones that suit you better. Keep your cards close to your vest and see what other options you have.

"
23 may 2017,cancer,"A lot of self-help gurus promise overnight peace, serenity, habit breaking and developing a successful mindset. But is that the way life really works? Not in your world, Cancer! Aggressive Mars in the house that deals with mental and emotional “cleansing” is encouraging you to cut negative thoughts and toxic ties, but the problem is that the red planet wants instant results. On the other side of the heavens, disciplinarian Saturn (who’s older and wiser, thank you) tells you that achieving these states is a day-by-day thing. After all, you don’t stop smoking for one day and call yourself a non-smoker, right? Time is the best judge.

"
24 may 2017,cancer,"If you want to make progress with a certain relationship, today’s a smart time to work on it. That’s because the emotional Moon is in a “team spirit” kind of a mood. Make sure that you keep that attitude going over the next few days and be up front in a friendly way about your needs. Playing the passive aggressive game, or trying to guilt people into getting what you want isn’t going to fly.

"
25 may 2017,cancer,"You’re currently going through a rather stressful time as the cosmos is trying to help you cleanse the negative “kaka” from your life. Kaka takes many forms, as we all know, from obnoxious exes to our own bad habits to not enjoying our job. But today’s new moon is the terrific antidote, a lunation that will inspire you to clean house (or the toilet, as it were). From your chart it appears that one of the first things you need to do is to be honest about the people in your world. Any frenemies there, or malcontents? If that’s the case you have some decisions to make.

"
26 may 2017,cancer,"You may have been locked in a battle of wills with someone, and finessing it probably hasn’t been easy. Fortunately some helpful aspects arise today and over the weekend that will enable you to gain better control of the situation. This primarily comes from within as your sense of dignity and authority rises. Forget what you’ve heard about the meek inheriting the earth. You need to stand up for yourself.

"
27 may 2017,cancer,"Simplicity is underrated in our over the top culture, but people in the East have long known about the benefits of paring back. It’s time to declutter. Cut back on your activities and the amount of new things you buy. Stick to the essentials. This not only applies to your outer world but also your inner world. Does your mind need to be going in 20 directions at once? No? Then find new techniques for decluttering your brain as well.

"
28 may 2017,cancer,"The recent new moon may have encouraged you to go within and do some much needed pampering and nurturing, but today’s no time for cocooning at home. A sparkling Mercury-Neptune aspect tells you to get out there and mingle. The contacts you make could end up being quite beneficial: think matchmaker or potential business associate. Work your connections as best you can into the first week of June.

"
29 may 2017,cancer,"Trying to do everything by yourself can lead to resentment and burnout. So….stop being an enabler, the family consigliere, the go-to person at the office, or the friend who’s always there for others but when you need a hug there’s no one around. Mars is in a place which could make you feel isolated, and if you decide to go the smug little saint route you can. But Saturn tells you to look after your own needs right now.

"
30 may 2017,cancer,"This is a smart time to push hard with a goal you want to achieve, but keep your plans to yourself. Schedule job interviews, a meeting with an attorney or a mentor who can help you. There are some fast (but good) changes coming as you’ve been working hard and making a good impression on people who are decision makers. They can help you but for now you need to keep your conversations under wraps.

"
31 may 2017,cancer,"Mending fences with the people in your world becomes easier today with a helpful Mercury aspect. You may come to the conclusion that you need to be more of a team player, even if you don’t feel like it! But cooperation will get you further in the future than going it alone. Besides, from your chart it looks like some of the people you will connect with will have some sage advice for you.

"
1 june 2017,cancer,"If you’ve been yearning for more structure in your life and less chaos, you’ll be happy with today’s Venus-Saturn trine. This goes for romantic unions as well as professional pursuits,  not to mention going after other big goals such as weight loss. It’s not that the outside world is going to suddenly change and obstacles disappear; this is more of a mental shift in which you become determined to get things done regardless  of the chaos. As they say, you can’t stop a locomotive, and that’s what you’re going to become.

"
1 june 2016,cancer,"Hold your horses. Big plans may hit a snag today as the Sun squares Neptune. It appears that not all systems are go, and that you may need to go back and reach closure on certain topics before progress can be made. So if your relationship is a bit of a mess right now, you might need couples’ therapy before taking the next step. Check your business plan for holes before you do a launch. Make sure that you’re the person you need to be emotionally before you take on a big role.

"
2 june 2017,cancer,"There’s a lot to be said about enjoying a peaceful life at home, whether you’re single and living solo or married with kids. A sweet Sun-Jupiter aspect allows you to work things out with family members and loved ones, even if they don’t live under the same roof as you. You may need to lay down some practical rules and boundaries about household chores or the kind of behavior you expect, but with next week’s full moon occurring in your ultra-practical sixth house, that shouldn’t be a problem.

"
2 june 2016,cancer,"What big career dreams fill your head, Cancer? The Moon in the house of optimism and big picture thinking will stir you up to think about that today, and it forms a magnificent angle with inspirational Neptune. Better yet? Your money and financial security houses are a part of this planetary conversation.

"
3 june 2017,cancer,"Sometimes we realize in the blink of an eye that a previously cherished goal is not meaningful to us anymore. Or a brilliant idea or new dream pops into our head, and we feel that we must pursue it. That could happen today, Cancer, as a fabulous meeting of Venus and Uranus occurs in the heavens. Toss out outmoded ways of thinking and set a new course. This could be in any area of your life, by the way, from love to career to health. And don’t be surprised if you find yourself yearning for the more traditional things in life, such as a secure and happy marriage or a hefty retirement account. These two planets meet in the house of old-fashioned values.

"
3 june 2016,cancer,"Watch your words! A tense Grand Cross in the heavens wants you to be careful as to what you say, type, print or publish. That’s because the Sun and Venus are stationed in your secluded twelfth house of confidentiality. Problem is, the ego-driven Sun may push you to blab something that’s not ripe yet for general dissemination. Serious Saturn on the other side of the solar system is saying, “Don’t even think  of going there.” This is especially true of any work or contract-related matters. Keep a lid on it. Remember the Wizard of Oz? “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.”

"
4 june 2017,cancer,"Get out of my way! Yup, you’re on a roll, Cancer. Red hot Mars just entered your sign, making you the guy or gal to watch. Your self-esteem and charisma will rise exponentially in the weeks ahead as you dive right into projects that are near and dear to your heart. That may simply mean spending more time with your kids or eating healthier foods. But if you’re interested in world domination, well, that’s possible too! You’re just going to have to push the other Cancers out of the way. Survival of the fittest, babe.

"
5 june 2017,cancer,"Are your ideas your own, or is someone trying to sway you to their way of thinking? Let your intuition be your guide rather than listening to the advice of others. Problem is, deceptive Neptune is active, swirling its foggy mist. But Mars just entered Cancer yesterday, so your sense of awareness and self will increase in the weeks ahead.

"
6 june 2017,cancer,"A sweet, social season lies ahead now that charismatic Venus is in your house of camaraderie. This is no time to mope at home, singles, as getting out there and networking is the best way to find new love. Even couples will enjoy partying with a group rather than spending a lot of time alone with each other. Regardless of your relationship status, the next three weeks are super for getting involved in volunteer and charitable activities.

"
7 june 2017,cancer,"You’re in a “wrapping up” mode this week, thanks to Friday’s full moon arriving in your house of efficiency and getting things done. And today Mercury slides into your quiet and confidential twelfth house, an excellent aspect for creative thinking, finishing tasks and reflecting upon the next step. With your birthday season officially kicking off on the 21st it’s smart to clear your desk and your mind of clutter.

"
8 june 2017,cancer,"Your sign is known for its love of the comforts of home, so it’s not surprising that decorating your nest is important to you. A happy Jupiter-Neptune aspect urges you to dig in and start creating the place of your dreams. This also applies to your outdoor environment, so head to the garden and start digging. Neptune is the planet of inspiration—let it flow!

"
9 june 2017,cancer,"Are you one of those people who thinks that in order to get things done right, you have to do it yourself? Maybe not, Cancer! A sparkling full moon in your efficiency sector recommends that you loosen your grip a bit and delegate. This is a great time to review your routines to determine where you can cut back on your personal workload. This goes for home as well as the office. Would it really kill your spouse or child to push a vacuum around the house? Is it necessary to be the office mule, taking on assignment after assignment? Set some boundaries and stick to them.

"
10 june 2017,cancer,"Aaahhhh. Tension lifts as sweet Jupiter resumes direct motion in your house of home and family. People may actually start cooperating with each other. An ex may finally leave you alone. Your parents find someone else’s life to butt into. The mortgage gets approved. You find a better place to live. Cleaning out the closets and getting organized somehow seems less daunting. The bottom line: more peace of mind.

"
11 june 2017,cancer,"Got the urge to purge? A sudden desire to get organized and feel on top of things could hit you today. Don’t be surprised, then, if you’re emptying out junk drawers or your e-mail account. But this also applies to fitness, so get thee to the jogging trail.

"
12 june 2017,cancer,"Keeping information to yourself is critical this week, so choose your confidantes wisely. It’s a smart time to do work behind the scenes too, without a lot of fanfare. An intelligent Mercury-Jupiter trine today allows you to pursue avenues that will make for a happier and more secure home life. So—look for a new place to live, talk to an assisted living place about possibly taking in your parents, consult an attorney about the back child support your ex owes you. If a new job would make you feel more at ease, start looking.

"
14 june 2017,cancer,"You’re a go-getter, Cancer, and today you’ll be motivated to plow though your chores at home and the office. Just don’t find yourself in a situation in which you’re doing all of the grunt work. While you may feel better about yourself for being on task and helpful to others, the people in your world may be more than happy to take advantage of your good nature.

"
15 june 2017,cancer,"It appears from your chart that your daily routine needs a lot more structure. Whether it’s your workout regimen, getting the kids off to school or finishing tasks at the office, too many loose ends and inefficient rituals are going to trip you up. If you need to let go of certain commitments, do so, and delegate to other people if you can.

16 june 2017,cancer,"Rome wasn’t built in a day, Cancer, and now that Neptune is retrograde in your house of big thinking, you’ll have to slow your roll. But this isn’t a bad thing. A grand plan needs careful execution; otherwise, it’s just a super idea. Lots of people talk the talk but they don’t want to get their hands dirty with the grunt work. Now’s the time to focus on the details and craft a strategy.

"
17 june 2017,cancer,"Just how much adventure or risk do you want to take in love, Cancer? These days finding a keeper who’s a stable partner is looking far more palatable than hooking up with an exciting but inconsistent lover. And if you’re already attached, Neptune’s recent retro turn will encourage you to dial down the drama in your union.

"
18 june 2017,cancer,"You may have a rather quick change of heart when it comes to an aspiration or dream that has meant a lot to you. This doesn’t mean that you’re going to chuck it; rather, you may refine it to make it even juicier! Your birthday season is about to begin, and next Saturday the annual new moon occurs in Cancer. That’s the time to launch new endeavors.

"
19 june 2017,cancer,"You may feel that you know what’s best for other people in your personal or business life, but trying telling them that. Others may be operating with their own weird “logic” that makes no sense, but what can you do? Sometimes you just have to let folks make their own mistakes so that they can learn from experience.

"
20 june 2017,cancer,"Your official birthday season begins tomorrow, Cancer, and the cosmos has an early gift for you: a hush-hush meeting between Mercury and Uranus. These are the two planets of genius and strategizing, and they are holding a conversation about your career prospects. So reach out to prospective employers, research an idea for a business you could start, snoop the competition or consider entering a new field. The next four weeks are awesome for gaining momentum.

"
21 june 2017,cancer,"Oh, yeah! Happy birthday to YOU, Cancer. The cosmos has a sweet surprise for you: both the Sun and chatty Mercury enter your sign today. They stroll arm-in-arm into Cancer, helping you dazzle others with your magnetism. This should be a far more social birthday season than years past thanks to the chatty messenger planet in a party mood. Book those mimosa-filled brunches now.

"
22 june 2017,cancer,"Your birthday season is here and to thine own self be true. Over the next week or so you’ll start initiating new projects and ideas that mean a lot to you. However, there could be some naysayers close by, people who may put up resistance to your efforts. Put them in their places if need be.

"
23 june 2017,cancer,"With so much planetary activity now occurring your sign, you would be forgiven for feeling confused about which direction to head in. People around you may have advice but the best kind of wisdom comes from within. With the Moon forming positive angles with the Sun and Mercury, you’re coming from a rational place. Trust your judgment.

"
24 june 2017,cancer,"Hey there, hot stuff! Your birthday season kicks off nicely with a new moon in your sign. This is the cosmos’s annual gift to you, a lunation that enables you to pursue your heart’s desire. There’s a strong networking vibe in the air, so don’t try to go it all alone. The people you know (and the ones you haven’t met yet) will play an instrumental role in your success over the next year, so get out there and mingle.

"
25 june 2017,cancer,"You’re more than ready to bust out of an old groove, thanks to hosting three planets in your sign and a recent new moon there as well. But family issues may be holding you back, or people who are stirring up dramas in an attempt to get attention. Well Cancer, you can’t put out those fires and at the same time take care of you. This is now your  time.

"
26 june 2017,cancer,"Your birthday season takes flight with a soaring Mars-Neptune aspect. The watery planet is in your house of philosophy and it encourages you to change your viewpoint–about love, your talents, the kind of work you do and the kind of life you want to live. Pick up a biography about someone who dared to walk to the beat of their own drum, or watch an inspirational movie. Then crib some tactics!

"
26 june 2016,cancer,"Big doings today in the cosmos as two of the most powerful heavy hitters form a magnificent angle. Jupiter and Pluto are trining each other, a superb aspect for Cancers who are climbing that ladder. Now and over the next few days is the perfect time to make contacts with people who can help your ascent. A partnership or alliance is beneficial now, and it may be something that you’d never considered before. This is Mercury’s last day in your confidentiality sector, so you won’t have to keep things quiet for long! Your intuition should be on point and will guide you along the path ahead.

"
27 june 2017,cancer,"You can’t please everyone, so you have to please yourself. And that won’t be too hard this week as a bevy of planets in your sign are encouraging you to let your freak flag fly! Eventually the people around you will catch up to you and realize that you’re on the right track. Eventually.

"
27 june 2016,cancer,"As Mars bolts back into direct motion, creative projects that have been on the back burner (or under review) can now move forward. It’s a great time to self-promote, as chatty little Mercury zips into your house of self-image. The messenger planet also happens to be the planet of negotiation, sharpening your wits and smoothing your words. Oh, and romance happens to be in the same house as creativity—so your love life should get a boost too!

"
28 june 2017,cancer,"“Discipline” is a dirty or unpleasant word to a lot of people as it conjures up images of kale salads and long hours in a cubicle. But you won’t need discipline to make things happen; all you need is the planet Mars, the ultimate momentum machine of the solar system. Today the red planet meets up with smart little Mercury, lighting a fire under your tush to start taking action on whatever birthday goal you want to achieve.

"
28 june 2016,cancer,"A business relationship needs to be realigned, and the key is communication. Your business connections are of paramount importance now and in the near future–make sure that everyone is on the same page before moving forward.

"
29 june 2017,cancer,"It shouldn’t be surprising that you’re primarily focused on your own desires right now, thanks to a bevy of planets in Cancer. But as it so often happens in life, once we start to travel down a different path—and certain people begin to notice it—they try to stymie our progress. Tough guy Pluto may bring out the annoying side of these people, who could be critical or uncooperative. Ignore them and soldier on.

"
29 june 2016,cancer,"An unexpected development may arise today as someone may suggest joining forces for the betterment of both of your careers. Or perhaps it’s you with the bright idea to team up with or retain an expert who will help further your ambitions! With the recent full moon in your house of work assignments, it’s not surprising. Your hard work may have caught the eye of movers and shakers.

"
30 june 2017,cancer,"Who’s wearing the pants at home? It’s a recurring theme over the next week or so, Cancer. Don’t just think that a spouse or parent is getting too bossy–it could also be a kid, roommate, ex-spouse, landlord or relative (who doesn’t even live under your roof). You’ll need to create boundaries, or risk getting run over.

"
30 june 2016,cancer,"Look out for #1! That phrase often has negative connotations, drumming up images of selfish, greedy selfie-taking narcissists. But in reality, there are times when you simply must put your needs before those of others, and now is one of those times. This is especially true when it comes to romance. By the way, don’t expect the SO to be happy about you needing more space–and more of a voice. Pluto in your house of commitment indicates that a partner may be (too much) in charge.

"
1 july 2017,cancer,"Travel and vacation plans may require some adjustments in the weeks ahead. From your chart it appears that matters at home need to be addressed before you can charge off into the wild blue yonder. Wednesday the 5th is a super time to figure it all out.

"
1 july 2016,cancer,"It’s your time to shine! Magnetic Venus is in Cancer, your house of self-image. It’s also the place that deals with kicking off important new cycles and going after your passions. With Venus forming a marvelous aspect to Jupiter, your thinking will become more nimble, your judgment more astute and your willingness to take a chance increase.

"
2 july 2017,cancer,"There is no room for drama today with a partner, whether it’s a lover or a business alliance. A harsh Mars-Pluto opposition could find you on either sides of an issue and things could get heated. A full moon occurs next Saturday in your commitment sector, so try to work things out as the full moon will demand closure.

"
3 july 2017,cancer,"Ready to take a chance in love? From your chart it sure looks that way. With a full moon arriving in your commitment sector this coming weekend, you’re either going to take things to a higher level with your amour, or….you just might cut bait and move upstream. If that’s the case, why not start “shopping” now?

"
3 july 2016,cancer,"Start setting intentions for what you’d like to see in your life, Cancer! Tomorrow the cosmos delivers its annual birthday gift to you, a new moon in your first house. Neptune is in your corner today, adding a touch of glamour, intrigue and optimism to the proceedings. Enjoy!

"
4 july 2017,cancer,"An amazing healing time begins as golden girl Venus soothes your tired mind and soul. The planet of ease and comfort has just glided into your psychological sector, the place where we hold fears, resentment, and bad habits. What this means is that changing unpleasant thought patterns can actually be easier and faster than expected. And this includes anger at an ex, or carrying a torch for someone who isn’t worth it!

"
4 july 2016,cancer,"The cosmos delivers a sweet birthday gift in your lap, and it’s the annual new moon in Cancer. You can use this terrific lunation in just about any way you want. Neptune is pushing you to live more authentically and with greater creativity, but Saturn urges you to be practical and to develop a good routine.

"
5 july 2017,cancer,"What happens over the next 48 hours will remind you that you’re in charge of where your life is heading. Others may think that they have a say-so, but at the end of the day it all comes down to you. Remember that over the weekend when the full moon occurs in your house of compromising!

"
5 july 2016,cancer,"How high can you fly? A magnificent trine between Mercury and Neptune tells you to go for it—whatever “it” is! Your planetary aspects for growth are phenomenal. Don’t worry, with Saturn in your efficiency sector, you’ll be approaching your dreams in a practical manner.

"
6 july 2017,cancer,"Just how much are you going to have to sacrifice your own needs in order to keep the peace? You may be reaching your limit with this. Unfortunately, if you don’t speak up others may think that you’re perfectly OK with the status quo. Either that, or you like being a martyr.

"
6 july 2016,cancer,"Step into the spotlight, Cancer! Planetary aspects are pushing you out of the shadows and into a position of power. As Mercury glides in front of the Sun, your ability to impress others and kick off new plans is off the charts. A romantic or business partner may not be on the same page as you right away, but that will change.

"
7 july 2017,cancer,"No monsters under the bed for you, Cancer! Nor in the dark recesses of your mind. A super Mercury-Venus aspect provides you with the logic to examine your fears or worries and recognize them for what they are–inconsequential.

"
7 july 2016,cancer,"With the Sun, Mercury and Venus all in Cancer, you should be raring to go. There’s nothing that’s going to hold you back…or is there? A tough opposition today indicates that a partner may not be supportive of your plans. There could be anything from silence to passive-aggressive behavior to an outburst, but keep your head up. Friday gives you the opportunity to talk things over.

"
8 july 2017,cancer,"A tense Mars-Pluto aspect about a week ago may have created friction in romance, and things could come to a head tonight at the Capricorn full moon. However, Saturn–planet of maturity–is in a good angle, creating a practical vibe. And amorous Neptune suggests that you stop nitpicking and take a longer view. A lot of you will tie the knot under this lunation–once you get everything ironed out, that is!

"
8 july 2016,cancer,"If you have a vision, share it. A marvelous Mercury-Jupiter meet up indicates that you are in a prime position for pitching ideas, impressing people, instructing them and letting them know how you feel. This holds true for business contacts as well as personal ones. The energy keeps rolling all weekend, straight into Monday.

"
9 july 2017,cancer,"Emotions could be building up inside that need to be released, but it needs to be done constructively. This could be true at home and at the office. Key clients and bosses may not be easy to deal with in July, so don’t be too thin skinned. Once Mars and the Sun move into Leo on the 20th and 22nd, your self-esteem will rise.

"
9 july 2016,cancer,"Sometimes the planets warn to keep your lips zipped, other times they tell you to let it all out. Today is a perfect time to vent, share, laugh, negotiate and comment. Have no fear, there is no aggression here! Just a happy meet up between the emotional Moon and optimistic Jupiter, telling you to speak your mind.

"
10 july 2017,cancer,"It’s high time that you stand up for yourself, even if the other party doesn’t like it. This could be a romantic partner, an ex or a business contact, but if anyone else in your world has their bossy pants on, smack ’em down. This energy has been building for awhile and could show up again on the 17th and 20th. All the more reason to take care of it now.

"
10 july 2016,cancer,"With the fiery Sun and outgoing Mercury in your house of self-esteem and charisma, you’re the person to watch these days, Cancer! You might want to put that charm to good use today, as there are two fabulous aspects that will help you draw closer to a lover. And yes, single people, I’m talking to you too. Artistic crabs should use the energy on tap to promote their talents, as you stand a good chance of scoring a deal.

"
11 july 2017,cancer,"Your family, home and personal lives need some attention, Cancer, so don’t feel guilty about blocking out time for them. This may mean that other obligations have to be put on hold for a bit, but so be it. When the Moon enters Pisces this coming weekend you can go back to socializing with your friends.

"
11 july 2016,cancer,"Tiptoe around power brokers, oh crabby one, because a tense square could put you in their crosshairs. Whether it’s your biggest client, the boss, a judge, or a radar-wielding police officer, you don’t want to ruffle any feathers. Criticism may be dished out, but just take it with a stiff upper lip and move on. Mercury and Venus are scheduled to roll into your income sector this week, so take comfort that a little more green could be lining your wallet.

"
12 july 2017,cancer,"Fresh ideas could pop into your head, and you would be wise to consider them. With the Moon in the most forward-thinking part of your chart, you will be willing to take a chance–to go out with that new guy, finally sit down and write the book, or plan an epic voyage around the world to parts unknown.

"
12 july 2016,cancer,"Prosperity is within reach, Cancer, and the good vibes start today as profitable Venus heads into your income sector. It’s not enough to have the skills, talent and a polished resume—you also have to look the part. Venus is all about appearance, so make sure your hair is well styled, your grooming is perfect and your wardrobe is spiffy enough to impress head honchos.

"
13 july 2017,cancer,"Being outspoken can sometimes be a curse, other times a blessing. And today it’s the latter! Don’t hold back, as people need to hear what you have to say. Maybe it’s, “I love you.” Maybe it’s a cutting edge idea that can turn a project (or the company) around. Perhaps it’s a blog post or a compliment with just the right inspirational words that someone will greatly appreciate.

"
13 july 2016,cancer,"They say that money talks, and of all the signs of the zodiac, this applies to you! Mercury, the planet of commerce and negotiation, has entered your income sector where it will remain for several weeks. The time is ripe for reaching out to contacts, making presentations, interviewing for a new position or creating new lines of products and services. With Venus in the same part of the sky the profit potential is fabulous.

"
14 july 2017,cancer,"If you have been avoiding facing up to certain issues, today’s cosmic energy brings the chance to handle them with ease–and practicality. A productive Mercury-Jupiter aspect boosts your self-esteem and provides solutions too.

"
15 july 2017,cancer,"“Hell, yeah….I can do  this!”  That’s your motto o’ the day, Cancer, as the Moon glides through the most optimistic part of your chart. Don’t be surprised if you suddenly decide to head off in a brand new direction that you hadn’t considered before or were too nervous to try.

"
15 july 2016,cancer,"Something will happen today that will streamline your life for years to come. Maybe it’s the decision to cut back on activities that are overloading your schedule; perhaps you cancel your gym membership (the one you never use) and get more done by working out at home. The key to rocking today’s energy is to look at your chores, routine and schedule and start snipping away at the tasks that aren’t serving you well.

"
16 july 2017,cancer,"With so much recent planetary activity pushing you forward, encouraging you to step into your own power, you could be receiving flak from others–who may sense the change in you. This vibe isn’t going away anytime soon, so get used to smiling at them diplomatically–and then doing what suits you regardless.

"
16 july 2016,cancer,"The Sun in Cancer is placing your needs and goals in the spotlight, and it would be wise to give them some thought before El Sol moves into Leo next Friday. A tense Uranus-Sun square could find you getting fed up with a boss or a client and ready to make some changes. Fortunately, a confident and decisive meeting between Venus and Mercury will help you brainstorm your next move. They are in your income sector, so start thinking about ways to increase your earnings.

"
17 july 2017,cancer,"You don’t have enough facts to move forward with a particular plan or goal, so slow down and retrench. The harder you push the more resistance you’ll experience. Once the Sun enters Leo later this week clarity will arrive.

"
17 july 2016,cancer,"Thinking about cementing a bond with someone? La Luna enters your partnership sector today, culminating in a full moon event on Tuesday. Serious relationships are what it’s all about, be they about romance or your livelihood. It’s time to get off the fence and move forward, and that applies to all Cancers. Singles have an awesome opportunity to meet a keeper over the next six months. Business people will find that they can make more progress by working as a team, rather than going solo. Consider your options.

"
18 july 2017,cancer,"This is one of the most romantic days of the month thanks to amorous Venus in a superb aspect with abundant Jupiter. But in your case, it’s not about grand gestures, i.e. the big date at the expensive, buzzy restaurant. No, this is more about staying at home with a bottle of wine and really getting to know your partner.

"
18 july 2016,cancer,"The nature of a partnership may be changing, Cancer, and this is a good thing. Planetary influences indicate that trying to do things the same old way just isn’t working anymore. It’s time to hit the “refresh” button on your alliance, whether it’s a personal one or business. If the refresh button doesn’t work but the system crashes, it may be time to move on.

"
19 july 2017,cancer,"Getting everyone on board to achieve a task becomes easier with a productive Mercury-Saturn trine. And this will also help build your personal resolve to develop better habits and routines. The best way to go about this is to put everything in writing (Mercury insists!) so that there is no mistaking what needs to be done next.

"
19 july 2016,cancer,"The last six months have been bringing relationship matters to a head, and today’s full moon in your partnership sector could find you on the verge of a major decision. Some Cancers will tie the knot, others will part ways with a lover who hasn’t fulfilled their end of the romance. The good news is that a positive Mercury-Saturn angle could bring in a new flame who’s more of a team player for you singles out there. Committed Cancers are entering a period of greater security and financial stability.

"
20 july 2017,cancer,"It may be summertime north of the equator, Cancer, but it’s time to buckle down and analyze your finances instead of playing in the Sun. That’s because energetic Mars enters your income sector today, to be followed by the Sun on Saturday. This is one of the most auspicious times in years to boost your earnings; don’t waste it.

"
20 july 2016,cancer,"With make-things-easy Venus in your income sector, you should be actively looking for new ways to bring in cash. Whether it’s more clients, a new gig or starting your own business, current planetary aspects are excellent for pulling in sources of money that will be with you for years ahead. Stable Saturn is in your house of work assignments, aiming to help you build a strong financial base.

"
21 july 2017,cancer,"This is no time to tell someone to stick it where the sun don’t shine, no matter how badly they might deserve it! There have been some button-pushers in your life as of late, and they’re still at it today with a Sun-Uranus smackdown. Let it pass. Once the Sun enters Leo tomorrow you’ll start feeling a lot more in control.

"
21 july 2016,cancer,"With the Sun entering your income sector tomorrow, you have four weeks in which you can make progress. Make haste, however. Unpredictable Uranus is scheduled to go retrograde on the 29th, making it difficult to pin down new clients, bosses and other authority figures. Today is strong for negotiating terms with business associates, things that will bring more security to your bottom line.

"
22 july 2017,cancer,"Don’t be crabby because the Sun has left your sign. Yeah, the birthday party is over, but now El Sol is in your house of making mo’ money and experiencing greater self esteem. If boundaries need to be set with people around you, do so. And while you’re at it, develop better habits and hold yourself to a higher standard too.

"
22 july 2016,cancer,"Yessss! The Sun is now in Leo, your make mo’ money sector. It joins intelligent Mercury and profitable Venus, so between these three you should be able to self-promote successfully. Ask for the order or raise, close the deals, drum up new sources of income. The new moon on August 2nd opens up a six-month cycle of growth. Start planning now.

"
23 july 2017,cancer,"The new moon in Leo lights a fire under you to get organized and make more money. But you’re going to have to tap dance your way around bosses, key clients, hot prospects or authority figures as unpredictable Uranus could make them hard to read. The good news is that your intuition is sharp these days, thanks to Venus, so use that to your advantage.

"
23 july 2016,cancer,"Oh, the places you’ll go! Dr. Seuss knew what he was talking about, Cancer. Innovative Neptune is helping you see possibilities that you may have overlooked before in all areas of your life. But with the fiery Sun charging through your house of income, you may want to focus first on increasing your earnings. Wednesday is super for showcasing your talent to authority figures.

"
24 july 2017,cancer,"Lots of progress can be made at the office or at home, but you’re the one who’s going to have to be at the helm. Someone close by may be playing a passive-aggressive game, pretending to be helping when they’re really not interested in being a team player. If things need to be done, you may have to do them yourself.

"
24 july 2016,cancer,"Sometimes you just gotta show everyone who’s the boss, and surprise, surprise….it’s you. Take control of matters in your life that have been festering or at a standstill for way too long. When Uranus goes retrograde this coming Friday, decision makers around you may falter. It’s time for you to step up to the plate, otherwise you’ll be waiting even longer for issues to be resolved.

"
25 july 2017,cancer,"Money talks, and your ability to earn more can skyrocket now that shrewd Mercury is in your communication sector. The next four weeks are superb for landing a higher paying job or building new revenue streams. But if you want to see more green, you’re going to have to self promote.

"
25 july 2016,cancer,"Two heads are often better than one, but today you would be wise to listen to your own counsel. A Moon-Pluto square will pit your ideas against a partner’s, whether it’s in romance or business. Your thoughts have merit–it may be best to keep them to yourself for now. When the Moon moves into Taurus tomorrow you can start to turn them into reality.

"
26 july 2017,cancer,"Nothing, and I mean nothing, is going to stop you from making progress with your financial goals. The two most energetic and motivated orbs in the solar system, Mars and the Sun, meet up in the heavens, pushing you to pull in more dinero. When Venus enters Cancer next Monday you’ll be able to charm the birds from the trees…so work it!

"
26 july 2016,cancer,"A promising relationship could move forward in the near future as the Moon enters your house of camaraderie. Whether it’s a business connection or a budding new friendship, try to make plans with folks who can end up being a big part of your future. Oh, did I forget to mention that that includes love?

"
27 july 2017,cancer,"Emotional issues at home or with the family can be addressed over the next 48 hours, and it looks like you’re the one who’s going to have to bring them up. It seems that people ned to understand what rules and consequences are. Start drumming this into their brains now, as the August 21st eclipse will be all about new routines.

"
27 july 2016,cancer,"It pays to be frank and upfront today, literally! Ask for the order, the raise, the new job. Talk about your skills openly and with pride. People in decision making capabilities will be listening.

"
28 july 2017,cancer,"Judging other people is a part of the human experience, but today’s pleasant cosmic energy tells you to let it go–and just focus on making yourself happy. The ancient Taoists believed that our body and minds are like a temple: they need to remain pure, uncluttered and serene. Go within.

"
28 july 2016,cancer,"There could be a difference of opinion between you and someone close, most likely a friend or lover. The Moon in Taurus is pitting your ideas and plans against their’s, but this isn’t a deal breaker. With intelligent Mercury in your communication sector you can talk things over and come up with a solution.

"
29 july 2017,cancer,"You may feel like biting someone’s head off and they may well deserve it, but the planets warn to keep your cool. Once sweet talking Venus enters your sign on Monday you’ll be able to charm your way into making matters improve.

"
29 july 2016,cancer,"S-l-o-w  m-o. That’s the gear your career may feel like it’s in over the next few months as Uranus retrogrades in this part of your chart. Decision makers may be difficult to reach or pin down. But this period can be beneficial, as it gives you the opportunity to sit back and analyze your strategy. If you rely heavily upon technology for your line of work, it may be time for an upgrade or some classes as Uranus rules the digital world.

"
30 july 2017,cancer,"Sometimes the best way to ooze charisma and sex appeal is to keep things covered up and low key. Let the trashy Real Housewives put all the “merchandise” on display! Your best bet is to keep it classy and mysterious with alluring Venus in your secluded twefth house.

"
30 july 2016,cancer,"Lucky you–Mercury, that energetic little planet known for its gift of gab–has just entered your communication sector! Hustle, Cancer, because it’s going to go retrograde exactly one month from today. Polish up proposals and resumes, finish your thesis, work on ad and marketing campaigns, and get that book started. Reach out to people too, whether it’s the local mom’s network to arrange play dates for the kids or the neighborhood block association. Socialize, network and multitask.

"
31 july 2017,cancer,"All eyes are on you now that magnetic Venus is in your sign! And with so much planetary activity in your houses of earning an income and meeting new people, you’re in an awesome position to boost your finances while you connect (and party!) with others.

"
31 july 2016,cancer,"You’re making some big plans for the future, Cancer. Whether you’re writing a screenplay, starting an online presence, or getting ready to trek through Africa, nothing is going to hold you back. So you might want to tell that to your partner, who seems to be copping a bit of an attitude these days. This could be a spouse, SO, business alliance or even an ex. If you stand on the railroad tracks, chances are you’re gonna get run over.

"
1 august 2017,cancer,"Tossing out old routines and replacing them with smoother, even healthier ones is the name of the game now that Venus is in your house of efficiency and vitality. It’s interesting that the ancients placed both of these in the same sector–they knew that feeling vibrant is a result of good habits. Besides, the better systems you have in place at work and at home, the less stressed you’ll feel.

"
1 august 2016,cancer,"A powerful Sun-Saturn aspect opens your eyes to a project or idea that may be worth pursuing. Your ambition is running high, so it’s not surprising that you’re spotting opportunities all around you. With long-term Saturn involved, whatever you undertake could prove to be a winner, provided you focus first on the details.

"
2 august 2016,cancer,"Get ready to move mountains! But don’t burn out in the process. Energetic Mars barrels into your efficiency zone today, sparking your desire to cut through delays and get things done more productively. And profitably, too, as a new moon also occurs in your income sector. New sources of cash could come your way. Just watch out for the tendency to work 14 hour days.

"
3 august 2017,cancer,"Don’t count your chickens before they hatch, Cancer! Erratic Uranus retrogrades for five months in your house of big dreams and goals, creating a one-step-forward, two-steps-back kind of a vibe. That said, you can still make a lot of progress–just give things plenty of time to gel.

"
3 august 2016,cancer,"Who’s the boss? A strong beam from energetic Uranus tells you to seize the reins today, as a situation needs your firm hand to guide it. You may need to set rules, protocols and boundaries for the people in your home and work circles, but so be it. The cosmos is pushing you to excel, and to achieve your ambitions. Success can’t be built on a flimsy foundation.

"
4 august 2017,cancer,"I’ll be honest—trying to win a family argument or romantic dispute will be damn difficult today, Cancer! Someone may be determined to do things their way, and the problem is that you may be tempted to let them make their own choices. Chances are they’ll make the wrong ones, but try telling them that. Wait until the full moon on the 7th to put an end to the nonsense.

"
4 august 2016,cancer,"Sweet talking Venus is getting ready to glide into your communications sector, enabling you to become both persuasive and eloquent. And you’re going to need her help. Some tough aspects indicate that others around you, particularly co-workers and clients, are not open to fresh new ideas and are digging in their heels. When Saturn goes direct on the 13th, things will ease up. Until then, let the honey flow from your lips–even if it kills you!

"
5 august 2017,cancer,"Breaking the rules is one of those things that often sounds delicious but carries way too much risk. Luckily, you now have the opportunity to shake things up a little bit without going off the deep end. Take that chance!

"
5 august 2016,cancer,"Stern Saturn has been retrograde for months in your work sector, which may have brought about issues with slacking co-workers, unreliable employees or flaky clients. Red tape may have been thick and you’ve been banging your head against a wall dealing with inefficient protocols. But Venus comes to your rescue today, entering your communications sector. So while the slackers and red tape may still be there, your ability to work around it soars.

"
6 august 2017,cancer,"Who’s the boss at your residence, or within your family unit? Today’s the kind of day when you may realize that trying to play nice and be a “team member” just ain’t working. So if you need to take a stand and put people in their places—so be it!

"
6 august 2016,cancer,"Standoff! Mars and Venus are a tad annoyed with each other today, courtesy of a square between them. Squares indicate that something needs to be worked out, and the matter at hand is: who’s in charge? Yup, aggressive Mars has its bossy pants on while Venus is trying to make nice. This energy could crop up anywhere–at the office, in a romantic relationship or a in a family dynamic. There’s no honor in being a doormat, no glory in being a tyrant.

"
7 august 2017,cancer,"Ready to see more cash in your bank account? Yeah, I thought so. Lucky for you, tonight’s lunar eclipse in Aquarius can help you wrap up financial negotiations, a real estate deal, windfall, inheritance or court award. And if you’re not involved in any of these matters, you’re still in a good spot as this is the house of making smart investment decisions and developing new passive income streams.

"
7 august 2016,cancer,"KISS. Keep it simple, sweetheart. That’s the motto for today as an opposition between chatty Mercury and confusing Neptune takes place in the heavens. You certainly have the gift of gab these days, thanks to some positive planetary action in your communications sector, but others might not get what you’re saying. By the end of the week things should turn around. But pay attention to those people around you who do  get it and are pretending that they don’t.

"
8 august 2016,cancer,"You can’t embark on a journey unless you’re willing to set sail and leave the shore. Watery Neptune is encouraging you to chart a course and let the wind carry you into a new future, but practical considerations and fears may be getting in the way. Chiron, the wounded healer, is active today, helping you get to the root of your concerns.

"
9 august 2017,cancer,"Money matters require a firm hand these days, and you may find that getting advice from a savvy professional is the best way to go. You may need to make adjustments but the good news is that the cosmos definitely has your back when it comes to accruing wealth.

"
9 august 2016,cancer,"Educate yourself about all the aspects of a decision you’re in the process of making, or a plan that you’re considering. Thanks to intelligent Mercury’s position in your third house of research, you should be able to uncover aspects that perhaps weren’t apparent before. A sweet Moon-Venus aspect also helps, as it provides creative solutions that you can act on right away.

"
10 august 2017,cancer,"Sweet day for sweet talk! Flirt, whisper, laugh, flatter, chat up a new flame, and make plans with your current amour. But despite the frisky vibe, some stability can be reached within a relationship–a nice bonus indeed.

"
10 august 2016,cancer,"How you relate to other people is the focus of the planets this week, and a powerful trine today will open your eyes. Doing things the same old way just isn’t cutting it anymore. So if you’ve been killing people with kindness, only to get nowhere, it may be time for some tough love. Likewise, if you’ve been coming on strong, switch to a more mellow approach, or even drop the subject altogether–at least until the other person gets it.

"
11 august 2017,cancer,"As Scooby Doo is famous for saying….”Ruh roh!” Yup, Mercury goes retrograde–and it does so in your communication sector. Between now and August 31st Cancers, of all the 12 signs of the zodiac, need to be careful about what they say and put in writing. One of the issues at hand is that you’ve got great ideas, but others either can’t appreciate them or are trying to oppose them. Your best bet is to keep them to yourself, at least for now,

"
11 august 2016,cancer,"You’re ready to get down to business and get some work done, whether that means putting together a business plan or weeding the garden. The problem is that the people in your orbit, from family members to friends to co-workers, seem to be getting in the way of you doing the job! However, going into tyrant mode is not going to work. With sweet Venus and benevolent Jupiter in your communications sector, you’ll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

"
12 august 2017,cancer,"The more forgiving and relaxed you are, the more you’ll draw people in to your circle–and your way of thinking. This is especially true in the romance department, where a sultry Venus-Neptune aspect helps bring some peace along with some juicy, amorous excitement your way!

"
12 august 2016,cancer,"Chances are you’re getting mighty motivated to get things done, thanks to the Moon swinging past both Mars and Saturn in your efficiency sector. Just don’t be so ambitious that you try to force longer-term plans or projects into existence before the time is right. Slow down and make sure that you’ve got all your ducks in a row first.

"
13 august 2017,cancer,"It may be the weekend but you’re ready to dive into projects and get them the hell off your desk and put them way behind you. Whether it’s catching up with work assignments or cleaning out the basement, your motivation will drive you forward. The next 72 hours are excellent for creating new habits and routines too.

"
13 august 2016,cancer,"Finally–forward progress! Your daily routines both at home and at work have been under the strict scrutiny of retrograde Saturn. Over the past five months you may have tried new hacks and routines that were designed to lighten your workload and become more efficient. Delays may arisen with slacking colleagues or employees, computer systems that were out of date, or clients who kept making demands. Now that Saturn is direct, your routines should run more smoothly–and less stressfully.

"
14 august 2017,cancer,"Friends and colleagues are your lucky charm today, so work those connections! A pal could introduce you to a new lover, tip you off about a business idea or serve as a good sounding board. This is also a smart time to seek the advice of a mentor or expert if you feel that you need it.

"
14 august 2016,cancer,"Saturn went direct yesterday in your extremely efficient sixth house, firing you up to get stuff done. But don’t tackle too much too soon. Neptune and Venus are at odds today, indicating that long term plans and projects need a heck of a lot more thought before you charge ahead. With intelligent Mercury in your house of thinking you’ll be able to sort things out.

"
15 august 2017,cancer,"Honey, it’s time to take good care of yourself  rather than tending to everyone else’s needs. A Venus-Pluto opposition warns that you’re putting too much energy into helping others, to the point where you won’t have any energy left for yourself. Stop being Mother Teresa.

"
15 august 2016,cancer,"With the mighty Sun forming a fabulous angle with Uranus, you can hit upon some business ideas that will set you apart from the rest. The potential for making more money is excellent, but in order to profit from your brainstorms, you may need to seek the help of a mentor who can guide you down the right path. An alliance with another person may be the best way to go.

"
16 august 2017,cancer,"Getting down to brass tacks with your income is what it’s all about, not chasing down high falutin’ dreams that have little chance of paying off. If you have a big financial goal or plan, today’s the day to distill it down to a practical set of steps that are easy to follow.

"
16 august 2016,cancer,"This is one of your best days all year to hit upon an idea that can take your career and income to a much higher level. Futuristic, innovative Uranus is sending glorious beams to the Sun, helping you impress decision makers with your concepts. When Uranus is involved, doing things the same old way isn’t even an option, so start brainstorming. This energy will last for several days, so take advantage of this cosmic gift.

"
17 august 2017,cancer,"Your self-esteem may take a hit today due to a tense Venus-Jupiter square, but it doesn’t seem that the source of your discomfort is on the outside. Rather, it’s your own insecurities getting the better of you, temporarily that is. No problem—Monday’s solar eclipse in your house of dignity will change that right quick.

"
17 august 2016,cancer,"With Venus in your chatty house of communication, you can sell ice cream to Eskimos. Helpful, considering that today Venus trines Pluto, an awesome aspect for negotiating and discussing matters with a partner. Both in romance and business, you’ll be able to cajole, charm and win over the hearts and minds of people who count.

"
18 august 2017,cancer,"With the Moon passing through your sign before it enters Leo for Monday’s eclipse, you should be thinking about the goals you have for the future. New possibilities are beckoning but for some reason you seem to be resisting them. Let’s face it, resistance is always strongest right before a new course of action is begun, so get ready to dive into the deep end of the pool!

"
18 august 2016,cancer,"You may be wrapping up an important financial deal, such as buying a house, settling a lawsuit or entering into a business deal. The full moon in your finance sector is pulling all of the pieces together. However, due diligence is needed when signing papers as Jupiter opposes Chiron. That being said, whatever deal is on the table looks good, so as long as you’ve done your homework you should be in good shape. Not closing a deal? Then use this energy to strengthen your portfolio by increasing your earnings, a strong possibility with the Moon in Leo.

"
19 august 2016,cancer,"You’re quite the idea factory these days, Cancer, as Mercury, Venus and Jupiter are revving up your brain waves. Next week is a good time to present your ideas to others, but they need more polishing up. A Moon-Venus opposition today warns that you may be pushing too hard, and in doing so you’re overlooking key details. Slow down and pay attention.

"
20 august 2016,cancer,"It may be the weekend, but some Cancers are negotiating deals left and right. You could be buying or selling a house, trying to close a client or are considering a job offer. Don’t make a decision today, or sign on the dotted line however. A tense Moon-Venus opposition indicates that you need more time to think things over. Wait until the Sun enters Virgo on Monday, which is your smart thinking, wheeling and dealing zone.

"
21 august 2016,cancer,"You’ve been working hard lately, Cancer–maybe too hard. And with the passionate Moon in your ambitious tenth house today you might feel even more determined to make headway with a goal. But the planets warn that you run the risk of burnout. Take some time to stop and smell the flowers.

"
22 august 2016,cancer,"With the Moon swinging past Uranus, the planet of inner genius in your career sector, you may stumble upon brilliant ideas that will enable you to fulfill your ambitions. The best part? The Sun enters Virgo today, your third house of thinking, communicating and negotiating. Get to work on your plans right away for maximum results.

"
23 august 2016,cancer,"Something that may have appeared to be a fantasy or pipe dream may actually be doable, Cancer. The key is to adjust your expectations a bit. With Mars and Saturn side by side in your house of getting things done, you won’t be short on ambition or discipline, that’s for sure. Just spend a little time considering how you can make this thing work.

"
24 august 2016,cancer,"A friend or mentor may put in some good words for you, or help you out with a project you’re working on. Your diligence and ambition in recent weeks are admirable, but they may exact a price! Too much work and not enough play can make Cancer one tired soul. Plan some downtime for yourself this weekend–you deserve it.

"
25 august 2016,cancer,"Paranoid much? The Moon in your mysterious house of psychological depth could be making you worry about health or business issues. Problem is, murky Neptune is in a funky angle, which indicates that your intuition could be off today. So before you conjure up images of being rushed to the hospital or getting fired from your job, count to ten. Then call a a pal and make plans for cocktails at 5, at which time you can laugh this off.

"
26 august 2016,cancer,"Measure twice, cut once. That old carpentry saying is wise advice for you as the cosmos urges you to slow down–before you make a mistake. Mars is in your efficiency zone, riling you up to get things done, which is admirable. Whether it’s losing weight or trying to wrap up a work project, you want results. Problem is you’re too busy focusing on the big picture to pay attention to the details.

"
27 august 2016,cancer,"Say it loud and proud! An audacious meetup between Venus and Jupiter in the heavens paves the way for you to speak and be heard. These two orbs, the most generous in our solar system, hook up in your third house of communication. Write that book or screenplay, become a teacher, negotiate the mother of all business deals, or unleash a social media campaign that will go viral. Your words and ideas have power–don’t hold back.

"
28 august 2016,cancer,"The weekend has your name written all over it, Cancer. With the Moon in your sign it’s time to treat yourself to some downtime. Friends could call you to make plans, including someone who may have fallen off your radar awhile back. If there has been any tension between you and a pal this is a wonderful day to mend your relationship.

"
29 august 2016,cancer,"With Venus spending a few last moments in your house of thinking, writing and communicating, you may be tempted to wrap up a contract, proposal or some kind of negotiation. If everything is solid, do so. But if not, try to hold off as Mercury retrogrades in this part of your chart tomorrow. That’s OK–this gives you a chance to review every facet and polish things up.

"
30 august 2016,cancer,"You’re an idea factory these days, Cancer! The sector that governs expression and intelligence is fired up with powerful planets, and an eclipse is scheduled to occur here on Thursday. But make sure that everything you put out there is up to snuff as Mercury goes backwards in the heavens until September 22nd. Clients, friends and neighbors from the past could call you with socializing and working together in mind. These connections could pay off nicely in the future, so don’t brush them off.

"
31 august 2016,cancer,"Show me the money! With the Moon linking to rebellious Uranus, you’re anxious to see more money coming in the door–literally. From your chart it looks like you need it for family and home-related expenses. But with Mercury now retro you have to be clear with others and confirm all financial transactions and details. There could be delays, but with Mars and Saturn in such a strong position from your work area, new assignments or gigs could be coming your way.

"
1 september 2016,cancer,"Word up! A solar eclipse in your chatty third house of expression makes you the person to listen to. The next six months are auspicious for self-promotion, whether it’s via social media, blogging, writing a book or hitting the lecture circuit. Anyone in the arts benefits from this powerful energy as your ability to showcase your work is magnified, not to mention increasing your skill set. But all Cancers will be able to speak their mind with clarity and conviction, whether it’s with family members, a lover or the boss.

"
2 september 2016,cancer,"With Mercury backstroking through your house of expression, this is an excellent time to polish up presentations, manuscripts, websites, blogs, your art portfolio, contracts and proposals. Today Mercury forms a fabulous aspect with lucky Jupiter, indicating that anything you work on will enjoy success, and profits to boot. If you’ve been considering getting a teaching gig, returning to school or public speaking, look into your options now.

"
3 september 2016,cancer,"It’s a good day for making progress with the people closest to you, but communication is the key. Don’t expect everyone to read your mind and magically assess what you want and need. That being said, if you reach out to others, you can enjoy more contentment and security in the weeks ahead.

"
4 september 2016,cancer,"Power struggles could erupt at home as a number of celestial orbs are at odds with each other today over everything from vacations, to which sibling helps out the most, to child care. A tough Sun-Neptune opposition in the heavens will make it hard to separate fact from fantasy. When optimistic Jupiter enters your fourth house of domestic matters this Friday, however, things will begin to get smoothed out.

"
5 september 2016,cancer,"In the movies, the strong silent type (think Clint Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone) is always a hero among men as well as women. And there are some women out there too who say little but pack a powerful punch (think Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games).  With the mighty Sun moving ever closer to dominant, dynamic Pluto, you’re coming into your own strength. Words have great power: use them wisely and strategically.

"
6 september 2016,cancer,"Keep your wits about you if you’re in the process of negotiating anything, whether it’s a legal contract or just trying to get your lover to spend more time with you. A tough Sun-Neptune opposition could cloud your vision. Don’t give in to flattery, guilt trips or excuses–nor should you dish them out yourself!

"
7 september 2016,cancer,"Remember this from your report card? “Works well with others.” That’s the motto o’ the day as four positive planets encourage you to cooperate, for the good of the group as well as for your own personal gain. Dividing up the tasks that people need to take care of is part of this effort, so make sure that you’re not over or under delegating. The cosmos wants you to have more peace of mind and comfort, something that will become clearer after Jupiter glides into Libra on Friday.

"
8 september 2016,cancer,"Taking care of business is what it’s all about today, and that means getting caught up with your chores at home and at the office. The Moon and Mars are going to fire you up to get moving, and with structured Saturn nearby, you’ll develop smart habits that will stick. Neptune is a bit peeved from your house of travel, annoyed that practical matters are taking precedence over having fun, but you’ll be able to kick back and relax in the not too distant future.

"
9 september 2016,cancer,"A tender year lies ahead now that gracious Jupiter has entered your house of family and home. This is your best year ever for finding a new home or decorating your current abode. Any problems with landlords or mortgage companies should be alleviated, as Jupiter’s goal is for you to feel content and secure. This also includes settling family squabbles, especially with people above you on the family tree. You love to nest—this placement will help you create a home that’s a castle!

"
10 september 2016,cancer,"The daily grind may be pushing you to the point where you fantasize about the future, not a smart move under today’s planetary influences. Get-real Saturn is squaring Lala Land Neptune, invoking thoughts of running away from it all. Like: quitting the job and moving to an island so that you can open up a pina colada stand on the beach. Telling someone to take a hike. Ditching the grocery shopping so that you can binge watch some Netflix. Sorry, Cancer! Duty calls and daydreams need to be backed up with a serious plan.

"
11 september 2016,cancer,"Your emotions about a family or romantic matter may be all over the map today as Venus squares Pluto. The best way to handle it is to let the feelings flow, then get real. This is no time for holding things in, but nor is it the right time to play mind games–with yourself or others.

"
12 september 2016,cancer,"Don’t assume that everything is cast in stone this week, Cancer. A series of squares advises that you focus on the details of projects or relationships you’re working on. They may need adjusting, something that will become more apparent with Friday’s lunar eclipse in Pisces. But this is a beneficial aspect as the eclipse’s energy will move your plans along, perhaps even much faster than anticipated.

"
13 september 2016,cancer,"There seems to be a disconnect between you and some of the people around you. If you feel like you’re talking and they’re not listening–or they’re not getting it–you can blame it on a Sun-Mars square. But that’s OK. A glorious lunar eclipse this Friday will help take your message to a much higher level. You’re going to be given a brand new platform on which to present your ideas, and to people who are actually interested.

"
14 september 2016,cancer,"A happy meeting of several celestial orbs bodes well for making progress at the office. Don’t be afraid to express your deepest thoughts to people in positions of power, as they will be impressed. If bosses or key clients have underestimated you in the past, they’re in for a big surprise!

"
15 september 2016,cancer,"An unexpected opportunity might be coming your way to advance your career. Spontaneous Uranus in your house of ambition forms terrific angles with Mars, the Moon and Neptune. This is all about expansion and getting away from the same old grind. Stepping on to a more public stage is also a possibility: publishing a book, landing media interviews or becoming a public speaker. Tomorrow’s eclipse can make things happen quickly!

"
16 september 2016,cancer,"If you’ve been looking for a platform on which to broadcast your talents or ideas, you’re in luck! Today’s lunar eclipse in Pisces is the ticket for more exposure, whether it’s getting published, scoring media interviews, teaching or hitting the lecture circuit. With energetic Mars in your house of work assignments, you could land some new projects, but make sure to wrap up things you were already working on before you move on to conquering the world.

"
17 september 2016,cancer,"It may be the weekend but the planets are talking about you experiencing amazing success in your career! A fortuitous trine between Uranus and Mars is custom made to showcase your talents. Better yet is that Uranus will stimulate your brain to come up with cutting edge ideas that will dazzle others. Keep a notepad handy to jot down your brainstorms.

"
18 september 2016,cancer,"It can’t be all work all the time, Cancer. You need to take a break from your your responsibilities and spend some time at home. Whether you’re single or are raising a family, quality time is needed. This may hit you rather quickly today as the Moon swings past erratic Uranus. They’re trying to send you a message to slow down and savor life more.

"
19 september 2016,cancer,"It’s time to stand up for yourself, Cancer. By nature you’re a creature who craves comfort, and currently you may be taking the position that it’s best to not rock the boat with people who are challenging you. The problem is that if you don’t face them now, you could be nothing but roadkill in a few months. On Thursday Mercury goes direct in your communications sector, so get ready to set some boundaries.

"
22 september 2016,cancer,"If you’re interested in making progress with a domestic matter, such as finding a new place to live, starting a family or taking care of your parents, the next four weeks are the best time in many years to do so. That’s because the mighty Sun enters Libra today, your fourth house of domestic bliss and contentment. Lucky Jupiter just went there on the 9th, so don’t waste this important and helpful energy.

"
23 september 2016,cancer,"This could be an emotional day as the Moon in your sign forms a difficult angle with optimistic Jupiter. One part of you may be looking at the sunny side of the street while the other side focuses on the dark alleys! This too shall pass. Monday is a banner day when things improve.

"
24 september 2016,cancer,"If the balance of responsibilities or power is off in a business or romantic partnership, today is perfect for discussing it. A pleasant Mercury-Pluto trine will enable you to clear the air. Avoid the tendency, though, to make it all about you.

"
25 september 2016,cancer,"All work and no play is going to make a crab dull and boring! You need to lighten up your workload, whether it’s chores at home or the pile on your desk at the office. Venus is now in your fifth house of fun and relaxation, but with the Moon in your more serious house of duty and obligations, you may feel like you need to cross items off your to-do list. Please.

"
26 september 2016,cancer,"Your overall feelings of security and contentment should increase dramatically over the next few months, thanks to a series of planetary aspects that are designed to help you feel more rooted. A sparkling Jupiter-Sun conjunction today sets the stage for changes to come especially in the area of home and loved ones: moving, buying a place, selling, redecorating, working out family issues and even starting a family of your own. A positive Moon-Saturn link indicates that more money will be coming in too in the form of a higher income.

"
27 september 2016,cancer," 
Ready to join forces with another? Energetic Mars enters your house of partnering for the first time in two years. This is serious stuff, so be discerning about whom you connect with: a new lover, a future spouse, a business partner or an expert (such as a booking agent or attorney) who will represent your interests. Pluto has been asking you since April to analyze any flaws or weaknesses in an existing relationship. Now it’s time to either fix them or part ways.

"
28 september 2016,cancer,"Excellent day to discuss things with a partner as the passionate Moon and intelligent Mercury trine Pluto. You need to get your relationship on a more even keel so that you’re sharing the balance of power. Focus on the issues that are in front of you right now, today, rather than discussing the long-term future. One step at a time.

"
29 september 2016,cancer,"Keep your ear to the ground, Cancer! A scoop could come your way about something important to you, an ambition or goal that is near to your heart. It’s possible that someone in a decision making capacity will be making decisions that will positively affect you. Sit tight.

"
30 september 2016,cancer,"Home and family matters get a boost today with an auspicious meeting of the Moon and Jupiter. Considering that the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, are forming a fabulous trine tomorrow, you could be considering a pregnancy, moving in with someone or (a drumroll please) meeting the parents. This is a good weekend also to shop for items to make your home more comfy and chic.

"
1 october 2016,cancer,"Ready to feather the nest? Move to a posher pad? Start a family or move in with someone special? If that’s the case today’s new moon has your name written all over it. Over the next six months you can make headway in these areas, in addition to saving up the down payment for a place, helping out your parents or settling family disputes. Romance is also in the air thanks to a sexy Venus-Neptune trine, encouraging you to be a bit more adventurous. Date someone who’s not your usual type, or plan a night out at a venue that you may not have considered before.

"
2 october 2016,cancer,"With yesterday’s new moon in your domestic sector, you’re entering a period in which your home life can and should be more peaceful and relaxing. A happy meeting between Pluto and Venus on Tuesday should have you thinking about where romantic love fits into this picture. Relationships with children should improve too as the Moon focuses on them today.

"
3 october 2016,cancer,"You’re going to need perspective this week as some tough angles may make you take everything way too personally. Today and tomorrow, however, are good days for talking things over with people close to you. Try to clear the air now so that your nerves and emotions aren’t jangled by the weekend.

"
4 october 2016,cancer,"Psychologists say that 90% of our daily actions and behavior are governed by habits and if that’s true, then we need to make sure that ours are excellent! And that’s what the cosmos is demanding of Cancers today with a potent Sun-Saturn sextile. A lot of our daily actions were shaped back when we were kids, and now is the time to examine what thought patterns and beliefs from our past might be holding us back. The good news is that Saturn is the planet of discipline so if you resolve to make changes, they should stick.

"
5 october 2016,cancer,"A productive Venus-Pluto aspect works wonders when it comes to discussing deeply personal matters with someone close. Pluto is the planet that plumbs the depths of our psyches, so getting down to the nitty gritty is a possibility today. Fortunately gentle Venus will allow this to take place without a lot of drama–and with plenty of healing.

"
7 october 2016,cancer,"Moody much? The Sun and Jupiter, two of the most beneficial orbs in our solar system, are both in your emo fourth house, with Mercury joining them today. The issue at hand is that over the next ten days they’ll be forming tight angles to other planets, possibly shaking your confidence and making you want to lash out, especially against a boss or lover. With manipulative Pluto in your partnership sector, it is entirely possible that a business or romantic partner may be trying to gain control of your relationship in ways that you don’t care for. But crying, raging, retreating, or sulking won’t help matters either. The full moon on the 16th helps put you in the driver’s seat.

"
8 october 2016,cancer,"Things could get emotional in a partnership, be it business or romantic, possibly resulting in a power struggle. The passionate Moon connects with both aggressive Mars and metamorphic Pluto in your house of alliances. Who’s in charge? Which of you is doing all of the grunt work while the other slacks? Hopefully you’re not in this situation but if you are, it’s time for a wakeup call.

"
9 october 2016,cancer,"Your opinion about what you need from love may be changing, courtesy of hosting transformative Pluto and fast moving Mars in your partnership sector. And with the Moon connecting with Pluto today, this process might be accelerating. Business alliances could also be affected, as you suddenly realize that changes need to be made–now.

"
10 october 2016,cancer,"If you’re looking to secure financing for a home or a home-related purchase, you’re in luck. This week planets in your domestic sector are forming good aspects, and today the inspirational Moon is in your finance house. Brainstorm ways you can earn more, save more and reduce your debt. A family member might help you with down payment money, but relying on your own smarts is a also a good way to go.

"
11 october 2016,cancer,"Truth be told, your weekly forecast holds some difficult aspects when it comes to home and family related matters, which covers a lot of ground: your kids (which includes custody arrangements), repairs (and the expense involved), and dealing with landlords, room mates and parents. But today is stellar for making things work, so by all means try to put dramas to rest as best you can.

"
12 october 2016,cancer,"Your need for security may not be the same as someone else’s, something you would be wise to remember in the week ahead. Whether it’s emotional, financial or job security, it usually takes two or more people to create. And they may not be as interested or committed as you are. That’s OK—the full moon next Sunday in your house of authority will help you get a handle on things.

"
13 october 2016,cancer,"Patience is definitely going to be needed today as a Mercury-Mars square could frustrate the living daylights out of you. Domineering Mars is in your house of partnerships, and today you may have just one nerve left—and your spouse, ex or a family member is working it. Watch what you say, as words can’t be taken back. You’ll need to remain calm through the weekend as this energy isn’t going away soon.

"
14 october 2016,cancer,"You know that great feeling you have when you’re caught up–with errands, the house cleaning, that pile of papers on your desk? Make the smart decision today to develop new habits that will keep you on top of everything. Saturn, the great disciplinarian, will help new protocols stick.

"
15 october 2016,cancer,"Try to keep a low profile in the days ahead, especially when it comes to dealing with people in authority. One of them could lash out with unexpected criticism, or try to gain control over a relationship or situation. Under current planetary influences, you may not be in the mood for rocking the boat. However, that doesn’t mean that you should let others steamroll right over you. Tomorrow’s full moon in Aries is perfect for gaining more authority of your own.

"
16 october 2016,cancer,"Finally! Tonight’s full moon in your ambitious tenth house can bring some much needed acclaim and progress your way. You’ve worked hard over the past six months, Cancer—now it’s payback time, in a good way. In the weeks and months ahead you will see the fruits of your labors. If that means changing jobs or careers, or starting your own company, so be it. Any ambition of yours is highlighted, not just work-related ones. But the Sun is in a tough angle to Uranus, indicating that home and family related matters still need to be resolved.

"
17 october 2016,cancer,"Super day to team up with mentors, new clients, business partners, pals, or your amour! A friendly Moon-Pluto aspect can also bring in new faces, people who can be part of your circle for a long time to come. Reach out to others and make an effort to expand your social network. With the Sun entering your work sector later this week, you’ll be glad you did.

"
18 october 2016,cancer,"Hey there, you sexy thang! Venus glides into your house of wellness and vitality today which of course includes your fit physique. Wait, you’re sporting a muffin top or a beer gut? Then get moving, Skippy–literally. Get thee to the gym or the jogging path in the park and start toning up. You never know whom you might meet while sweating yourself into a dynamic new bod.

"
19 october 2016,cancer,"You are in one heck of a sweet spot, Cancer! The recent full moon fell in your house of ambition, encouraging you to kick off or complete plans of great importance to you. And today a rare conjunction occurs between Mars and Pluto in your partnership zone, which could open doors to meeting new people. Whether it’s a new lover with serious long term potential or a person who’d like to join forces with you in a business setting, your ability to make the right connections is growing. Some of these folks could be major league decision makers too, a big benefit.

"
20 october 2016,cancer,"Watch your words today as you may be prompted to come off a bit too strong with someone. Likewise, you could be at the receiving end of some criticism, and it may throw you off guard. Someone in a position of authority (or a wannabe) could be copping an attitude. Don’t read too much into it and imagine the worst. When the Sun rolls into Scorpio later in the week, your mind will turn to more pleasurable things—like romance and having fun.

"
21 october 2016,cancer,"Take it easy there, crabby. With the emotional Moon in your house of self opposing Mars and Pluto, you could be tempted to take a nip at someone with those razor sharp pincers of yours. You may be chafing under the strain of the demands of a lover, business partner, ex-spouse or a client. This will pass within a day or so; chill. Better yet is that the Sun enters your fifth house of frisky fun and romance this Saturday. Start making plans.

"
22 october 2016,cancer,"Phew. After months of hard work it’s time to take a breather. El Sol has just entered Scorpio, your house of frisky fun, romance and creativity. Over the next four weeks the cosmos asks you—no, it demands!— that you chill out and have some fun. Spend more quality time with your lover and the kids. Take up a new hobby or vow to set aside time every week to immerse yourself in an activity that brings you joy and relaxation. Singles, this is a super time to meet someone new, so get out there and circulate.

"
23 october 2016,cancer,"Should you hold back in the safety zone, or take a risk? That may be the question today as optimistic Jupiter meets up with confusing Neptune. With the Sun now in the most creative part of your chart, chances are you’ve been considering living a more interesting life style. Fears and considerations might be holding you back. Perhaps you think you’ll look foolish or you don’t have what it takes. Wrong! When Mercury joins the Sun tomorrow, you’ll be ready to step out of the shadows.

"
24 october 2016,cancer,"Saying what’s on your mind gets a heck of a lot easier with Mercury changing signs today, especially if you need to communicate with a lover or a child. Singles, now’s the time to broadcast your availability and to put yourself in places where you could meet someone new. This placement is also excellent for creative types or those who need to think in innovative ways to get their job done. Thursday rocks for getting your ideas across and showcasing yourself.

"
25 october 2016,cancer,"While you’re clear on the direction a project should be taking, other people around you may be throwing monkey wrenches into the works. Stalling, being too opinionated, deliberately trying to undermine a group effort—all of this could be on the table today. Keep calm and carry on. Tomorrow is a better day for getting back on track.

"
26 october 2016,cancer,"Happiness at home is not far away with a series of happy angles over the next few days. Whether you’re single or attached, you should be focused on turning your home into a castle. “Just dating” folks could talk about moving in together, babies could be on the way, problems with roommates or family members can be resolved and chores can be assigned fairly to the people under your roof.

"
27 october 2016,cancer,"When chatty Mercury meets up with the Sun (as it does today), it’s time to hold a conversation and demonstrate your ideas. In your case, Cancer, they meet in your house of romance, fun and children. So: ask someone out. Talk to your boyfriend or girlfriend about where you’re headed. Plan a terrific weekend event, such as a party or going to a concert. Consider whether it’s time to start a family or not. And since this also the house of creativity, it’s a fabulous day for inspiration, showcasing your ideas, or signing up for a class or webinar that will take your talents to a higher level.

"
28 october 2016,cancer,"You’re not destined to always be slogging away at the office, Cancer! It may feel that way with aggressive Mars charging forcefully through your house of work, but today the red planet forms a sweet angle with Chiron. The message? Slow down and smell the roses. Believe it or not, you can probably get more work done in less time if you would spend more time recharging your batteries and relaxing a little.

"
29 october 2016,cancer,"The two most combustible planets, Mars and Uranus, are at loggerheads today, creating a tempestuous mood. You or someone close may not want to stick to tried and true methods. A difference in opinion could lead to feeling defensive. Someone may try to pull rank in a romantic or business partnership, pushing the other person around. Just know that a new moon in Scorpio tomorrow bodes well for ironing out your differences and enjoying life a heck of a lot more!

"
30 october 2016,cancer,"Time to let your talent shine! A new moon in the most expressive and creative part of your chart is custom made for showing off your skills. Over the next few months, do what it takes to develop them further. This holds true whether you’re an accountant, stay-at-home mom or a musician. Sign up for classes, read a book, attend a seminar or find a mentor. Inspirational Neptune is close by, promising that if you put in the effort that you’ll see results.

"
31 october 2016,cancer,"Recent planetary activity has been stirring up ideas and possibilities in your brain, and you may be keen to start working on them. But don’t push too hard or too fast. You need the approval, cooperation and good opinions of other people for some of these activities, who may not be as motivated as you are to get things done.

"
1 november 2016,cancer,"Confusion about the future of a long term plan clears up, especially in the area of romance. While it may have felt in the recent past that progress has been slow, a Sun-Neptune trine sheds light on what needs to be done next. This is also true for matters involving children—custody arrangements, their education, discipline—and whether or not you should conceive! Your skills and talents are well aspected too. It’s time to take your mojo to a much bigger stage.

"
2 november 2016,cancer,"The word o’ the day is: chill. Schedule some down time for yourself, whether you go solo or spend it with a lover or the kids. No one gets to the end of their life and says that they wished they had spent more time at the office. You may need to be the one in a romantic partnership who has to schedule the date nights or the quality time with the little ones, but it’s worth every minute.

"
3 november 2016,cancer,"Turn off the TV. Put the smart phone away. Shut down the computer. Instead, have a face to face talk with the people you love: kids, family, or a lover. When I was growing up my father never let us use the phone or watch television while we ate, as that was considered to be valuable sharing time. And that’s what the planets want you to do today: have meaningful conversations with your loved ones.

"
4 november 2016,cancer,"If you’ve been feeling that you have little or no say-so in a key relationship, your emotions could start to bubble up today. Erratic Uranus is active in your house of authority, so you may feel unsure about how to go about being heard. Try to talk things over on Monday, a positive day for discussion. But don’t wait, because once aggressive Mars enters Aquarius next week, you might erupt like a volcano.

"
5 november 2016,cancer,"Career matters and business deals can take a surprising turn for the better in the days ahead, thanks to a productive Venus-Uranus trine. You will have the opportunity to dazzle a boss, client or prospective employer with your money-making  (or saving) ideas, not to mention your talents. The 14th brings a full moon in your house of teamwork, so don’t be surprised if you are selected for a special role in a group project.

"
6 november 2016,cancer,"A sudden burst of energy may inspire you to get fit and live a healthier lifestyle, Cancer! With inspirational Uranus in your take-charge sector, you may quickly toss the Cheetos and chips from the kitchen cabinet and replace them with fruits and vegetables. Lace up the sneakers and head out for a run or power walk, then schedule time for physical activity in the week ahead. Considering that disciplinarian Saturn is currently in your house of habit-building, you can’t go wrong.

"
7 november 2016,cancer,"Do you go with your gut, and your own opinion, or do you do things the way someone else wants you to do them? That’s the dilemma today with a Moon-Sun square, but fortunately it’s short lived. You’re becoming more decisive, not only in your own personal affairs but those that involve others. There’s nothing wrong with taking charge of a situation. As a matter of fact, the cosmos recommends it.

"
8 november 2016,cancer,"You have a secret weapon at the office, Cancer—it’s your creativity. Innovative Uranus in your house of talent is stirring up your brain to come up with bright ideas, new protocols and financial strategies. Don’t be afraid to act on them, as it appears from your chart that you will benefit over the long run with more money in your pocket.

"
9 november 2016,cancer,"Hold on to the plastic in your wallet—as well as your tongue! Aggressive Mars just entered your house of finances and emotions. You could burn through cash and run up your credit cards under this aspect, so be careful when it comes to holiday spending. Likewise, keep a rational mind set. Don’t let jealousy, resentment and anger take over your mind quickly. That being said, you can make great progress when it comes to saving money and feeling more secure emotionally if you choose to focus on the right things.

"
10 november 2016,cancer,"Jimmy Buffett sings that changes in latitudes will bring changes in attitude and truer words were never spoken! A Moon-Neptune conjunction could put you in the mood for white sandy beaches and pina coladas, not to mention romance. So start trawling the travel sites and make some fun plans. Singles, new love could be found while on holiday, so pack your bags and go.

"
11 november 2016,cancer,"What a combo! Mars just entered your house of steamy sex two days ago and today his cosmic lover, Venus, glides into your house of commitment. Things should really start heating up in the next five weeks as the cosmos wants you to enjoy the company of a lusty keeper, not a seductive loser. Racy, provocative commitment-phobes and already married people are not the way to go right now.

"
12 november 2016,cancer,"You know the saying: if you want to get things done, ask a busy person to do it. The idea, of course, is that busy people have figured out how to efficiently handle what’s in front of them. But now’s not the time to be that busy person who gets dumped on! Yes, Mercury just went into your productivity sector, but the planets suggest that you let others pick up some of the slack. Otherwise you’ll be fried by the new moon on the 29th.

"
13 november 2016,cancer,"Getting along well with other people should become a lot easier in the weeks ahead. No, they’re not going to change, but your attitude will. You should find that it’s much easier to deal with the moods and quirks of the folks around you thanks to easy going Venus now in your house of relating.

"
15 november 2016,cancer,"An exciting new project could come your way, something with some serious profit potential. With Mercury in your house of efficiency you have what it takes to blast through it with ease. But co-workers or team members may not be as quick to get on board. Slacking and disagreements could arise, which will test your patience. When Neptune goes direct this weekend some of the confusion may dissipate and momentum can build.

"
16 november 2016,cancer,"What’s the best way to proceed with a romantic dilemma? It could be something small, such as telling your boyfriend that he needs to put the toilet seat back in place, or it could be something far more important. The good news is that your intuition is in fine form so use it to figure out the next step. Uranus’s position indicates that you  need to take ownership of the situation in order for it to improve.

"
17 november 2016,cancer,"Keep your opinions to yourself over the next few days! A tough Neptune-North Node aspect could create foot-in-mouth syndrome in which your words, no matter how well you mean them, could be misinterpreted. This is especially true at the workplace, where you need to tread carefully around co-workers and clients. Say your piece after Neptune resumes direct motion on Saturday.

"
18 november 2016,cancer,"Make sure that your opinions—and gut instincts—are the primary source when it comes to making decisions today, Cancer. A tough Mercury-Neptune standoff indicates that people around you may be trying to sway your opinion their way. Problem is, they could be operating with a hidden agenda. This is especially true in the workplace, where a client or co-worker may not be revealing all that they know. Just keep your nose to the grindstone, get your job done, then wait till next week when the fog clears.

"
19 november 2016,cancer,"Good news! If projects at home or the office have been stalled, now they can start to pick up steam. Currently you have several planets in your house of productivity, which has forced you to slow down and focus on details and procedures. But Neptune has been retrograde for five months in your house of “the bigger picture”. Now that the watery planet has resumed direct motion you can start focusing on the overall plan rather than the minutiae. This doesn’t mean that you can take your eyes off the daily routine, but that more optimism and a sense of completion will be coming your way.

"
20 november 2016,cancer,"Sure, it takes bright ideas to get ahead in the world and with Neptune now in direct motion, you should have no shortage of inspiration. But they need to be implemented and you have to develop the right skill set to do so. Today is perfect for considering the best habits and routines to follow, as well as how to become more of an authority in your field.

"
21 november 2016,cancer,"If you have your health–both physical and emotional–you can move mountains, and that’s the situation that you can  be in. Now that the Sun is in your vitality sector, it’s up to you to eat well, work out and get enough sleep. And with go-getter Mars touring your house of deep emotions, it’s also up to you to get rid of the nyah-nyah stuff: jealousy, resentment, obsession, and fears of not being good enough, to name a few toxic terrors. Next week’s new moon on the 29th helps you open up a new chapter.

"
22 november 2016,cancer,"A smooth running home environment is key to maintaining your serenity, not to mention your sanity. A helpful Mercury-Jupiter aspect will enable you to kick off a home organization plan that will set you up nicely for a more peaceful (and profitable!) 2017. Get the grunt work out of the way now, holidays be damned. You can thank me later.

"
23 november 2016,cancer,"Use the holiday slowdown at the office to focus on where you’re heading with your job. Clear off your desk, empty out your e-mail account, review the roles your employees play, consider new service providers and come up with long term plans for the next year. The new moon next week on the 29th will fall in this part of your chart, so get a jump on this now. If it’s time to move to a different company, work on your resume over the weekend.

"
24 november 2016,cancer,"Your desire for a peaceful home and family life could be thwarted today as people around you are in a touchy mood. More than touchy, actually.  They could be downright obnoxious! But this passes, and by the weekend you’ll at least have the opportunity to have a serious discussion with a romantic partner about where things are going. It’s possible that family members are opposed to your choice of romantic partner, or that a mixed family situation is off keel. You can get things back on track next week.

"
25 november 2016,cancer,"A tug of war may be brewing between the demands of your family and those of a lover, with you caught in the middle. There just don’t seem to be enough hours in the day for you to manage the needs of loved ones and your career. The new moon on the 29th in your ultra-efficient sixth house will help you delve into time management practices that should lighten your load.

"
26 november 2016,cancer,"Holiday weekend? What holiday weekend? The planets are focused on your career, Cancer, and the future is looking good. Today a sudden burst of inspiration could come your way that will help you on the job front. It could be the solution to a problem with employees or clients, a brainstorm about a new product or service you can add to your company’s lineup or a phone call from an industry contact who wants to toss an idea around. Next week’s new moon will help you take action.

"
27 november 2016,cancer,"Grunt work is never sexy, whether it’s cleaning the house, doing homework or powering through the pile o’ papers on your desk at the office. But with so much planetary activity encouraging you to get your act together, you’d be wise to get cracking with organization and catching up. The good news is that a helpful Moon-Neptune aspect can help you find more creative ways to do so. An empty desk leads to a more fun-filled mind!

"
28 november 2016,cancer,"Slow and steady wins the race, and the habits you establish in the days ahead can spell the difference between success or lackluster results. The planets are urging you to get house house in order, which literally means your home environment as well as the work flow at the office. The good news is that these new routines will spill over into other areas of your life, such as getting fit and carving out more family time.

"
29 november 2016,cancer,"An assertive new moon in your house of getting things done could really light a fire under you to produce. But you need to make sure that you don’t burn out, a possibility under the current planetary aspects. Mars is pushing you to earn more, Jupiter is telling you to get your home environment organized and decorated, Saturn is urging you to get fit and healthy, and Venus wants you to have more love in your life. Unless you want to feel like a hamster on a wheel, pick just one or two priorities and go after them first.

"
30 november 2016,cancer,"You’re ready to swing into action, thanks to yesterday’s new moon in your house of productivity. But Neptune is calling your name like the sirens from Greek mythology, the deceptive creatures that tried to lure sailors into crashing their ships into the rocky shoreline. This is no time for daydreams and fantasies. Get real and get things done.

"
1 december 2016,cancer,"This is no time to keep your emotions under wraps. A sparkling aspect between Mars and Jupiter is all about letting others know how you feel—in love, business, and family matters. The upside to being so open is that it can pave the way for positive events in the near future. Your financial picture especially can improve, so ask for the loan, the order, or the joint venture.

"
2 december 2016,cancer,"Yum. Effervescent Mercury zips into your house of romantic commitment today, just in time for the holiday season! Singles, the next few weeks are super for finding a serious contender, but put yourself out there before the 19th when Mercury goes retrograde. That being said, the cosmos still dishes up some positive aspects on the 24th and 25th, so don’t think that all is lost. Coupled up Cancers can work things out and find more quality time to enjoy each other’s company right now.

"
3 december 2016,cancer,"Your finances can improve dramatically in the weeks ahead as a series of positive aspects helps you pitch ideas to clients, bosses, co-workers and prospective employers. But before you do, make sure that all of your handouts, contracts, resumes and other pieces are perfect. You will need the help of others right now as the planets indicate that teamwork is necessary. While you can’t control what they do, you do have ownership over your own conduct and presentation. Sparkle!

"
4 december 2016,cancer,"This can be one heck of a passionate day as the Moon glides past Mars in one of the most stimulating parts of your chart! Most people think about sex and romance when they hear the word “passion”, but it can mean so much more. You can be passionate about your family, putting them first. You can be devoted to changing the world by being involved in a charity. Or you may spend your Sunday afternoons involved in a hobby or past time that makes your heart sing. Whatever uplifts you, make sure to partake in today.

"
5 december 2016,cancer,"Building a solid financial base is what the planets are encouraging you to do, Cancer, and with the passionate Moon in fine form today you may hit upon a way to earn and save more. Fortunately this positive energy carries through into early 2017 with Venus entering this part of your chart tomorrow. Inspiration may strike out of the blue, and it’s also possible that someone may suggest entering into a joint venture.

"
6 december 2016,cancer,"If you want to get something done, ask a busy person to help you. That saying may be true, as busy people tend to be efficient. But they also get taken advantage of, and that’s the risk you run in the next few weeks. With Mars and Venus in your house of sharing—work tasks, finances, emotions—you may be in demand as others ask for assistance. Pick and choose the people and activities you want to  be involved with, otherwise you’ll be in so deep that you won’t have time for yourself.

"
7 december 2016,cancer,"You’re entering a highly cathartic period, considering that assertive Mars has been asking you to examine your deepest emotions. This is not always an easy task, but things should go smoother once Venus enters the same part of the sky today. This is especially helpful when it comes to matters of the heart. Next week’s full moon on Tuesday falls in your sector of healing and closure, so expect to release things that have been on your mind for far too long.

"
8 december 2016,cancer,"The cosmos is lighting a major fire under your booty to go out there and make some serious coin. With assertive Mars and profitable Venus in your house of ambition, you have the smarts and the energy to pull off a nice success. Today you might suddenly decide to switch gears, though, or try a different angle or technique. Go for it. Success often requires a fresh way of thinking.

"
9 december 2016,cancer,"As the Sun and Saturn move ever closer in the heavens, they’re asking you to focus on the balance of labor at your office or home. Basically, are you carrying most of the load while others slack? If that’s the case it’s time to issue some edicts. Saturday will be the day to pull out the guillotine and starting chopping people’s heads off, but today the planets provide you the opportunity to travel the kinder, gentler path of negotiating first.

"
10 december 2016,cancer,"Your life needs to be running like a Swiss clock, and if it isn’t, you need to make some changes—stat! Serious Saturn asks you to examine your work habits, routines at home, and the efficiency of employees and co-workers. Everyone needs to be pulling their own weight. If they’re not, then it’s time to tell them to shape up or ship out. And speaking of weight—if yours is too high, Saturn demands that you address it. After all, this is the planet of no pain, no gain!

"
11 december 2016,cancer,"Serious relationships are going through a transformation these days, courtesy of Pluto’s activity in the commitment part of your chart. Today helpful Pluto-Moon aspect will allow the two of you to discuss future plans and goals. This includes business alliances as well as personal ones. With next week’s full moon falling in your house of closure, it’s time for old projects, attitudes and ambitions to be either completed or tossed out so that new ones can begin.

"
12 december 2016,cancer,"A bold idea might come your way, something that can catapult your career to a higher level. It may not have anything to do with a new line of work or inventing the next Spanx, but simply a better way of handling your existing projects and responsibilities. Don’t dismiss any idea as being foolish or impossible. Your intuition is on fire and could help you dream up some profitable new concepts.

"
13 december 2016,cancer,"Close the door on the past, Cancer. Today’s full moon is in the part of your chart that deals with cleansing, healing and moving on. You may especially feel this surrounding work and health issues as the Moon opposes Saturn. It’s time to get real—and disciplined—when it comes to lingering health issues. Difficult co-workers, too much red tape, a job that doesn’t pay enough—if that’s what you’re dealing with, it may be time to move to greener pastures. The week after Christmas rocks for getting your name out there with a new moon in the career house.

"
14 december 2016,cancer,"A person in a position of authority today may say or do something that will rattle your cage. The best advice, Cancer, is to bite your tongue and consider your next step. Yesterday’s full moon was in your house of closure, so if you’ve had it with someone’s attitude— a boss, a pompous client, a selfish lover—it may be time to move on. Quietly consider your options. With the Moon in Cancer your emotions may be high. Chill out and take your time before you make any major decisions.

"
15 december 2016,cancer,"Now that the Moon has entered your sign, you may be feeling more passionate about your goals and ambitions. However, you seem to be surrounded by red tape, delays, and people who can’t figure out what they want to do next. Count to ten and breathe, Cancer. This soon shall pass. Saturday is a much better today to get things done and to communicate with The Confused People.

"
17 december 2016,cancer,"Forge ahead with business deals and projects, as the Moon puts some passion in your efforts today. Regardless as to what co-workers, bosses or clients say or do, just keep plowing away. While you’re at it you may discover some helpful new routines and habits that will not only increase your ability to earn more, but your self-worth and serenity as well.

"
18 december 2016,cancer,"Retail therapy isn’t the way to go today, nor is overspending on holiday gifts. With the emotional Moon in your house of savings opposing reckless Mars, it will be easy to burn through a wad of cash if you’re not careful. Hold on to your money, because when Mars changes signs tomorrow you’re going to need it for some lofty pursuits.

"
19 december 2016,cancer,"Patience is a virtue, my Grandma used to say, and you’re going to need some in the weeks ahead! That’s because Mercury is retrograding in your partnership sector just as the Sun is firing up an independent streak. Relationship issues are going to come to the fore, and that includes baggage associated with an ex, who may decide to reappear on the scene in some fashion. Slow down and talk things over before heading to the door.

"
20 december 2016,cancer,"You are determined to make your mark on the world now that dynamic Mars is in the highly public ninth house. But before you take your standing ovations before the crowd, you’ll need to ensure that anyone you’re partnering with is on the same page as you. This could be either a romantic liaison or a business one. Working with a partner right now can really add momentum to your ambitions, but only if the other party is as committed to your vision as you are.

"
21 december 2016,cancer,"Sweet love! The mighty Sun enters your commitment sector today, making Cancers one of the most likely signs to hear wedding bells in the near future. Not to mention starting a family, cohabitating, meeting his or her parents, or simply growing closer to each other. But Mercury is  retrograde in this part of your chart, so if you want to make progress, first you have to clean up any “messes” or issues from the past. Singles, you’re in an excellent spot to meet a keeper, and with charismatic Mars in your house of open-mindedness, you could be attracted to someone who breaks the mold from the usual type.

"
22 december 2016,cancer,"A power struggle may arise within the family or people close to you, and it may seem to come out of left field. As Jupiter begins to form an opposition to Uranus, an aspect that will culminate on the 26th, tensions could be growing as someone is trying to place themselves in a position of control. What you need to remember is that no one can call the shots in your life other than yourself, so don’t roll over and play dead for anyone.

"
23 december 2016,cancer,"A creative or out-of-the-box idea can take flight with an auspicious Moon-Mars connection. Now that Mars is in your highly public house of big ideas and acclaim, you should be pushing hard to polish up brainstorms and written pieces that reflect your talent. When Uranus goes direct on the 29th, the brakes come off and you can showcase your work.

"
24 december 2016,cancer,"You should be feeling more in charge of your life with maverick Uranus acting up in your house of authority. This is a good thing, Cancer! And it won’t be a fleeting moment, not with Saturn involved. It’s high time that you step into a place of greater respect and self-assurance. When Uranus turns direct on the 29th, your self-esteem and confidence will grow even more.

"
25 december 2016,cancer,"Super swoony day with love planet Venus in a passionate mood! Couples could be talking about wedding plans, moving in together or starting a family. Singles could find new love this week, especially after the new moon on the 29th. But you could also find a greater sense of contentment and peace as Venus currently resides in the house of soulful catharsis.

"
26 december 2016,cancer,"Too much work and not enough down time can make a Cancer pretty crabby. You could reach a saturation point today at which you realize that there’s more to life than just plowing through the work at the office. New Year’s Eve brings a terrific aspect that helps you break out of a rut and experience more joie de vivre.

"
27 december 2016,cancer,"George Michael (may he rest in  peace) wrote and sang a fabulous song called “Freedom”, in which he says “I’ll hold on to my freedom. May not be what you want from me.” And today, the cosmos asks just how much freedom you need in a love relationship. The good news is that a positive Sun-Mars aspect will allow you to live your life within the constraints of a partnership–as long as you’re not too pushy about it!

"
28 december 2016,cancer,"Trolls, doubters, and nay sayers will always be out there, but that doesn’t mean that you have to listen to them. You’re about to enter a highly productive time in which you can pursue so many things of interest to you. Listen to your own heart, not the “advice” of others.

"
29 december 2016,cancer,"Confused about which direction to move in? Fortunately the fog should lift as erratic Uranus finally goes direct in your house of ambition and success. Not only that, romantic partnerships can start gaining momentum thanks to the new moon in Capricorn. Your optimism will start to rise, with New Year’s Day being a time for considering going after new goals that may have seemed laughable not too long ago.

"
30 december 2016,cancer,"Don’t be surprised if you’re craving adventure, or just a break from the same old grind. Inspirational Neptune in your house of wide open spaces and travel is calling your name, and the watery planet isn’t going to let up any time soon! Plan a weekend escapade or a well-deserved vacation, even if you can’t get away for awhile.

"
31 december 2016,cancer,"Who wants a buff body in 2017? Maybe the question should really be–who doesn’t? With Saturn, planet of discipline in your house of fitness, forming a glorious trine with Uranus, chances are your motivation is going to skyrocket. Uranus is in your take-charge sector, so you’ll toss out the lame excuses and take responsiblity for your health and wellness.

"
1 january 2017,leo,"This could be one of your biggest years ever for a deep romantic commitment and raking in the big bucks, but first you need to do some inner work. As success coach Jim Rohn says, “Your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development, because success is something you attract by the person you become.” A Mars-Neptune meet up today urges you to release the negative parts of your psyche–resentment, fear, jealousy–in order to develop forward momentum.

"
2 january 2017,leo,"It’s time to get real about matters of the heart, Leo. The passionate Moon, lusty Mars and amorous Neptune are all sequestered in your house of intimacy and libido right now, which can certainly turn up the heat! But the downside is that they might blind you to the truth about the relationship and the other person you’re involved with (or thinking about getting involved with!). Take your time and perform due diligence.

"
3 january 2017,leo,"The ancient philosophy of Taoism produced some of the most amazing people this planet has ever seen: the warrior monks, martial arts experts who understood that the best way to maintain peace of mind was through rigorous training. But before they even set foot in the dojo, they needed to rid themselves of the mental and emotional baggage that was holding them down. Now that cathartic Venus has entered your house of psychological depth, you should do the same.

"
4 january 2017,leo,"Mercury back spins into your fifth house of love and creativity today, which is a good news/bad news kind of a thing! It’s great for creatives as projects and clients you were working with in the fall and December can come back to life. If you think that taking a class or seminar will upgrade your skills, this is a great time to sign up. Now for love. Exes can come crawling out from underneath their rocks between now and the 12th (Good? Bad? It depends on how you feel about the person. If in doubt, block your phone and e-mail account.) Attached lions will need to work out relationship issues between now and the full moon on the 12th, and that includes matters that involve your kids.

"
5 january 2017,leo,"You could suddenly be inspired to pull out all the stops today and go for it, whatever “it” means to you! But your actions may be premature, and in your rush you could overlook key details. Slow down and set aside some time this weekend for strategizing, a must considering that powerful Pluto and the brilliant Sun will be meeting in your house of streamlining, details and organization. Mercury will resume direct motion on Sunday, allowing your creativity to flourish.

"
6 january 2017,leo,"Leos usually never shirk from drama, but you may be getting tired of life being a soap opera. Even if you’re not intrinsically a part of an ongoing stage play, such as the ones being put on by the office divas or your family, chances are you don’t want to be a spectator either. The good news is that Mercury’s return to direct motion on Sunday should calm things down a bit. Besides, you’ve got bigger fish to fry. Next week’s full moon in Cancer signals an end to things that have reached their sell-by date and a new chapter opening up.

"
7 january 2017,leo,"This could be one of the biggest days for you in 2017 Leo, as powerhouse Pluto and the Sun meet up in your house of strategizing and getting organized. Don’t underestimate this, as the decisions and plans you set in motion today could have far reaching consequences. If you’re the “big picture” type who’s great with overall concepts but not the details, you’re going to have to get down to the nitty gritty. The key is to analyze your habits and procedures both at home and at work, and how they affect all areas of your life, from fitness to saving cash to the way you get through chores and assignments. Then make a vow to 86 the things that aren’t working and replace them with new systems that do. You can thank me later in December.

"
8 january 2017,leo,"Too much drama can be draining, and with a full moon arriving this Thursday in your house of peace and serenity, chances are you’re not interested in dealing with divas, malcontents and even loved ones who want to stir up trouble. Fortunately Mercury goes direct in the sector that deals with kids and romantic partners, so at least they  should settle down. This is also a bonus for creatives and those Leos who need to think in more conceptual ways in their line of work, as this sector governs innovation and talent.

"
9 january 2017,leo,"You seem to be in a mood to cooperate and work with others, so what the hell is their problem? If you spend too much time trying to figure that out today you’ll get nowhere but frustrated, Leo. Tomorrow there may be more of the same, so your best move is to take a vow of silence for the next 48 hours and let them stew.

"
10 january 2017,leo,"Keep your head down at the office and just plug away at your work. Expressing your opinions or providing your input could backfire today, even if you’re 100% right and the input is valuable. Do you have employees working for you? Then dole out instructions and criticism carefully, as people could be touchy—and uncooperative.

"
11 january 2017,leo,"You’re a natural born leader, Leo, and with both the Sun and Pluto in your house of work assignments, you are ready to cut through tasks like a hot knife through butter. These are the two most authoritative orbs in the cosmos, so while they can motivate they also can make you a tad opinionated. Watch your words today. Even if you’re as silent as the grave, others may be interested in getting in your face. Hmmm…are they resentful of your ambition and upward trajectory?

"
12 january 2017,leo,"You can put lipstick on a pig, but that sow is still a pig, Leo! Stop trying to get people and circumstances to be something they’re not. The full moon in Cancer is telling you to put an end to useless dramas and situations so that you can move on. With Mercury moving into your take-charge sixth house, joining the Sun and Pluto, you’re ready to get important things done. Too bad other people in your environs aren’t as motivated. Cut bait and move upstream.

"
13 january 2017,leo,"It’s a good thing for all signs of the zodiac when the Moon enters Leo for the weekend, but it’s even better for you! Yesterday’s full moon in Cancer told you to say goodbye to the kaka of life, and now that La Luna has glided into your house, you can kick off new initiatives with even greater ease. A powerful Venus-Neptune aspect is perfect for doing some much-needed inner work.

"
14 january 2017,leo,"It’s a fabulous time to get fit, Leo. With the Sun, Pluto and Mercury all in your house of wellness and vitality, get going with the diet and exercise program, along with visiting doctors who can help you heal chronic problems. The full moon on Thursday occurred in your house of endings, and the ancients included ending illnesses as part of this sector. Both physical and emotional ailments can be treated and disposed of effectively under these powerful planetary aspects.

"
15 january 2017,leo,"It’s time to get down to the nitty gritty when it comes to a project or plan that can take you far. Lofty ideas are fine, but they need to be executed in order to pay off. Right now it’s wiser to stay focused on what’s right in front of you–the process-than the end result. It will come in its own time.

"
16 january 2017,leo,"We’re two weeks into 2017, and if you’ve already fallen off the resolution bandwagon today gives you the chance to climb back on it. A sparkling Moon-Pluto aspect allows you to analyze your habits and routines so that you can switch them up. The desire to make changes isn’t always enough: if it’s not backed by a solid set of habits, plans won’t take off.

"
17 january 2017,leo,"What you think and what you say should be two different things, especially at the office. Besides, why waste time trying to explain things to people who can’t figure things out for themselves? Sit back and let them make their own mistakes–then maybe they’ll be more willing to listen to sound advice.

"
18 january 2017,leo,"“Take your passion and make it happen!” Remember that from the movie Flashdance ? Today a happy Mars-Jupiter aspect tells you to dive into your passion projects. It appears that they may need some revisions, or a different way to approach them, but if you take a different approach you’ll get better, faster results.

"
19 january 2017,leo,"Projects that you’ve been working on may seem stuck in the mire, and frustration could be building on your part. Where’s the money, dammit? You’re pouring your heart and soul into your work, but progress is slow. Blame it all on a tough Mars-Saturn square in the heavens. They’re both stubborn little buggers, and Saturn demands that you become better at your craft in order to see mo’ money. This vibe isn’t going away soon, so get cracking.

"
20 january 2017,leo,"You’re in an interesting spot, Leo. The upcoming lunar eclipse on February 11th is designed to put your needs and plans front and center. Yet the Sun entered your partnership house yesterday for a four-week stay. Over the next few years  you will be torn between flying solo or developing close relationships with others. That’s because there will be a series of eclipses in Leo that continue into 2019 which will create the need for balance between your goals, and the desires of loved ones and business contacts.

"
21 january 2017,leo,"A number of planets have been active in your financial security house lately, encouraging you to get a handle on spending and saving. It seems that you need more peace of mind in all  areas of your life, so a good place to start is right here. You should only be buying the basics. Don’t worry, this austerity plan won’t last forever. Next month’s lunar eclipse in your sign will help open up new doors.

"
22 january 2017,leo,"“I adore simple pleasures” said Oscar Wilde, who really knew what he was talking about as the bon vivant of his day. Well, take a page out of the Oscar handbook, Leo, because the planets are telling you to indulge in enjoyment! Whatever it is that floats your boat, get to it. This vibe continues into Monday. Now is also the perfect time to indulge in new hobbies, sports or forms of entertainment.

"
23 january 2017,leo,"Keep your emotions in check and rely more on rational thought. Someone may try to push your buttons with the usual smarmy tactics: guilt, criticism, demands, or a superior attitude. Ignore their petty dramas and stay on task with what you have planned for the day. Tomorrow’s a much better day for gaining cooperation.

"
24 january 2017,leo,"With three planets in your highly emotional eighth house—Neptune, Mars and Venus—you may find that you’re experiencing knee jerk reactions to the things that people say and do. Even a traffic jam is enough to set you off. Fortunately intelligent Mercury steps in today and tells you to take a deep breath, slow down and take one minute at a time, one task at a time. It’s high time that you look after your physical and emotional health, Leo.

"
25 january 2017,leo,"The planets are lighting a fire under you to get organized, Leo, a trend that has been going on for awhile and shows no signs of letting up. Today the Moon gets into the action, helping you become even more inspired to transform your routines and habits. By the end of this week you’ll be glad that you did, as your life is going to become more action packed—but in a good way! A new moon kicks open a fabulous phase in romance and Mars enters your house of adventure. Trust me, there will be no time for cleaning out the garage.

"
26 january 2017,leo,"Reaching down into the deepest wells of your passion and emotion should be easy today with a helpful Jupiter-Venus connection. Naturally this can help you enormously in matters of the heart, but it can also be a big bonus in your career. These are the two planets that govern profits, so taking your passion for your work and channeling it can result in bigger bucks later this year.

"
27 january 2017,leo,"What’s going on with you, Leo? Is your love life taking a back seat to your job? It sure looks that way from the positions of the planets. There’s a new moon today in your house of forming deep connections, but the office and household chores are also calling your name thanks to Mercury and Pluto in your ultra-organized sixth house. The key is to find balance between the two, which also includes taking darn good care of your health and fitness levels. If you’re wondering how you’re going to fit all of this in, don’t worry. When Mars enters Aries on Saturday you’ll be able to figure it out.

"
28 january 2017,leo,"If any sign of the zodiac is ready for fresh new experiences it’s you, Leo! Throw open the windows of your life and let the stale air out. Now that megawatt Mars has entered your house of mind expansion, travel, freedom and adventure, it’s time to enjoy some new experiences–not to mention new people! Over the next two months some folks with interesting perspectives could come your way. Honey, you’ve got places to go and people to meet.

"
29 january 2017,leo,"Think big but work small. That’s the message the cosmos is delivering to you, Leo. You’re in a superb spot right now to visualize in a more revolutionary way, thanks to mighty Mars moving into your lofty and philosophical ninth house yesterday. With transformative and sturdy Pluto in your strategizing and details sector, you can easily take expansive projects and figure out the steps you need to complete them. Get moving.

"
30 january 2017,leo,"Passion, practicality, visionary ideas—these are all yours for the taking, Leo. Recent planetary aspects have set the stage for you to think intelligently with both  sides of your brain. This could, however, create a bit of a tussle as you try to figure out how to get things done the right way yet still have a sense of adventure. Don’t worry, lion—it can be done! It takes courage, but you’re not short on that, are you?

"
31 january 2017,leo,"The devil is in the details, Leo. You may be raring to go with a plan but the cosmos warns that you may have overlooked a few integral components. The good news is that Mars and Uranus are in the most visionary part of your chart, turning you into an idea factory. The bad news is that these are two of the most impatient, hot-headed orbs in the solar system. Take time to do things right, and to give others whose cooperation you need the chance to get on board.

"
1 february 2017,leo,"Something could happen today that might rattle your confidence. Someone could dish out some criticism, or try to pull rank. The key is to try to remain as objective as possible and not put on your own bossy pants in retaliation. With Venus getting ready to enter your house of authority you won’t need to beat anyone over the head to show them your smarts. They’ll find out in a much more subtle way.

"
3 february 2017,leo,"Everyone is entitled to my opinion! Leo, if you have something to say, then say it….on the biggest platform you can find. With planet of ease Venus in your house of expression, the next four weeks are perfect for being loud and proud. Defend your thesis, launch a marketing campaign, use social media to promote your brand, schedule media interviews, write a book, or start a career in public speaking. Just make sure that everything is perfect beforehand as Jupiter will retrograde in a rather detailed sector on Monday. If you have any doubts about a presentation, hold back and seek a second opinion.

"
4 february 2017,leo,"Taking your job home with you? That’s not OK if you’re so stressed that you can’t enjoy your down time. But it is  OK if you use your annoyance to come up with a Plan B—which is what the cosmos is suggesting you do. With a megawatt lunar eclipse arriving next Friday in Leo, you’ll be more than ready to make some major moves in all areas of your life. Happy with your career? Then use this weekend’s energy to plan the next big step.

"
5 february 2017,leo,"There is something in life called “tough love” and sometimes you need to mete it out. Your chart indicates that someone close to you has to get their life together and that you’ve been trying to help them see the light. Problem is, they’re either not willing or ready to take your advice. So be it. Step away and let them figure it out for themselves.

"
6 february 2017,leo,"Back to the old drawing board. Hold off on major launches or debuts until everything is “ready for prime time”. Jupiter has just gone retrograde in your third house of thinking, writing and all forms of self-expression. While you may become frustrated at projects taking longer to gel than usual, the good news is that the slower pace will help you work out kinks and potentially embarrassing and costly mistakes. Take a close look at your brand, if you have one, and make sure that it reflects the very best of you. Find a mentor, sign up for webinars or take a class that will sharpen your skills.

"
7 february 2017,leo,"With Friday’s lunar eclipse taking place in your sign, chances are that you’re already thinking about your own needs rather than those of others. This isn’t selfish though–it’s a healthy energy. If you have your act together, the better parent, spouse, employee, boss or friend you’ll be. And now that intelligent Mercury is in your house of one-on-one relationships you can relate to people in a more constructive way. Listen to them, pay attention, but remember that your needs must also be met.
 

"
8 february 2017,leo,"Walk softly and say little, Leo. A tense Moon-Pluto opposition could bring out the diva side of others and words might fly. If they do, make sure that you’re not the one saying or texting them. You’re about to enter a highly metamorphic time once the Leo lunar eclipse takes place this weekend. Keep your mind firmly focused on your own plans and keep out of the dramas that others want to create.

"
9 february 2017,leo,"With Friday’s impending lunar eclipse falling in your sign, Leo, you may already be taking stock of your life and the changes you’d like to make. Today a fabulous Sun-Uranus aspect could spark your desire to live more of “la vida loca” when it comes to romance. If your love life is about as exciting as watching paint dry, it’s time for a reboot–and you’re the one who needs to do it.

"
10 february 2017,leo,"RAWR!! Don’t hold back there, regal lion. There’s a lunar eclipse tonight in the heavens and it has your name written all over it. This is a huge  game changer as it’s the first eclipse in a series that will run until 2019. Just about every aspect of your life can change between now and then, and quickly at that. A terrific Moon-Jupiter aspect is suitable for launching a makeover. Writing projects, such as blogging or penning a book, are favored right now along with killing it in social media and the news media too. Oh, and your love life is heating up whether you’re single or attached with long-term Saturn in a good mood. This is your night, Leo—get out there and shine!

"
11 february 2017,leo,"You are your own best salesperson these days thanks to the lucky eclipse in your sign last night. It sets up six months of time in which you can shamelessly self-promote. With optimistic Jupiter giving you the gift of gab and sober Saturn lending gravitas, your words and ideas will impress others. This is true whether you’re trying to land more business, get your kids to clean their rooms or ask someone out on a date. Don’t hold back, Leo!

"
12 february 2017,leo,"The recent eclipse in your sign was like a gift card from the cosmos to use in any way you please. Initiatives begun now could start to bear fruit by your birthday season. But the planets warn against happy-happy, fluffy pink cloud kind of thinking today when it comes to finances. If one of your goals is to earn more and develop a stable financial foundation, then you need to get real about where you currently stand.

"
13 february 2017,leo,"The moody Moon may have you concerned about expenses and savings. You’re smart to be thinking about your finances because the Sun will soon be entering Pisces, your house of wealth. Passive income streams or side businesses are especially favored in the months ahead, and the solar eclipse on the 26th will illuminate some bright ideas for you.
 

"
14 february 2017,leo,"What a lineup you have for Valentine’s Day, Leo! First, long-term Saturn is in your house of romance. It sends glorious beams to the Sun, currently in the commitment sector. And with Mars and Venus, the planets of amour, in your adventurous and optimistic ninth house, you’ll be interested in love that makes your heart sing. No safe but boring romances for you, lion. But then I wouldn’t expect anything less of you.

"
15 february 2017,leo,"No matter how confident you are about your opinion, and how optimistic you may be that your ideas will be accepted, planetary activity suggests otherwise. Energetic Mars is blasting a path through your blue-skies-ahead ninth house, filling that brain of yours with brilliant and out-of-the-box ideas, but people around you may be stuck in doing things the same old way. No matter. Keep charging forward and keep those gems to yourself.

"
16 february 2017,leo,"Sometimes it’s best to pay attention to your own inner wisdom; other times you should seek advice from a mentor or expert. The latter is what the cosmos has in mind for you, Leo. Over the next few days ask yourself whom you can reach out to who will be able to give you the honest feedback, strategy or knowledge you need.

"
17 february 2017,leo,"You’re more than willing to be a team player, but you’re not  willing to be someone’s enabler, Mommy, maid or doormat. If anyone thinks otherwise they need to be put on notice that they need to start dealing with their own dramas and be responsible for their duties. Take care of this issue now, others it could be a bigger problem during the Pisces time period.

"
18 february 2017,leo,"If you have been trying to get closer to someone emotionally, the next four weeks should be the right time to forge a deeper connection. Today the Sun enters Pisces, your eighth house of intimacy and sharing. There have been a series of eclipses in this part of your chart since 2015 with one last one scheduled for the 26th. Progress may have been slow, but now things start to develop momentum.

"
19 february 2017,leo,"Color outside the lines, Leo. Your sign isn’t known for playing it safe, but sometimes you can get set in your ways. Add a little flair to your life with a new look in your hair or wardrobe. Head to a cultural event that’s different than the usual. Look into a new sport or hobby that you’ve been planning on doing “someday”. With the Sun in your house of passion, it’s time to get excited about life again.

"
20 february 2017,leo,"Meet and greet! The cosmos suggests that you expand your contact list, Leo. A lion may be a solitary, fierce predator but they’ve also got the urge to hang out with a tribe built into their DNA. Collaborations with others are highly advised in the weeks ahead, and it looks like you’re about to meet some interesting people. Keep an open mind and see where these connections lead.

"
21 february 2017,leo,"Hesitant to express your feelings or thoughts with someone? Today the floodgates open thanks to a harmonious trine between Jupiter and Mercury. Jupiter is retrograde, which could find you choosing your words carefully. But with a solar eclipse coming in your house of passion this Sunday, there really is no point in hiding your emotions or ideas.

"
22 february 2017,leo,"Finding the right balance between perfectionism and big-picture thinking could be difficult today, Leo. Go-getter Mars has you anxious to get things done, and we’re not talking the “small potatoes” stuff either. But subterranean Pluto warns that if you go too fast you’ll gloss over important details, not to mention pissing off people who aren’t operating at the same warp speed as you.

"
23 february 2017,leo,"Your sign is known for its creativity, and with mature Saturn in your house of skill development you would be wise to devote time on a regular basis to your craft, whatever it might be. Hobbies and sports are included here, along with the talents you bring to being a wonderful parent or savvy business person. Practice makes perfect.

"
24 february 2017,leo,"It’s a dreamy day as two of the most passionate orbs, the Moon and Venus, wink at each other across the heavens. While this naturally bodes well for romance, it can also spur you to daydream about some of the juicier things you want in your life–exciting vacations, running your own business or writing an Oscar-winning screenplay as examples. Let your imagination rip, Leo, because a highly inspirational time is about to open up for you.

"
25 february 2017,leo,"If your life has been a bit….dry and boring lately (yawn), get ready for an injection of joy and passion, Leo! Vivacious Mercury has just entered your house of joy and spirited excitement, which will be felt in all areas of your life: romance, work, going out, hobbies, you name it. A solar eclipse tomorrow in the same sector will vault you out of a rut and into a far more interesting place, so dust yourself off and clean the cobwebs from your mind.

"
26 february 2017,leo,"It’s time to see green, Leo–lots  of it. A solar eclipse in your house of BIG money occurs today, and it’s the final one in a series that has been going on since 2015. No doubt you’ve been pushing hard since then, perhaps with not a lot to show for it. That’s about to change as the eclipse represents the final round of effort. By the time your birthday rolls around you should be seeing the fruits of your labor.

"
27 february 2017,leo,"Pick just one or two good ideas to pursue, Leo, and work them until you’ve reached mastery. With so much positive planetary action in the most mental and expressive parts of your chart, you could easily get overwhelmed by options. Yesterday’s solar eclipse fell in your house of passion, so mojo is not a problem; being selective is.

"
28 february 2017,leo,"No matter how tempted you are to roar, fierce lion, it isn’t worth it today. Other people around you may be slacking, BS’ing and spouting whacked out opinions, but your best choice of action is to ignore them. Trying to reach a consensus ain’t gonna happen. You might as well be talking to a wall. Slink off to your lair or cubicle and do your own thing

"
1 march 2017,leo,"A lot has been said about manifesting, thanks to books like The Secret.  Whether you believe in the power of visualization or not, know that an auspicious meeting of the Sun and Neptune will provide you with the inspiration to create wealth. Don’t hold yourself back with limiting thoughts about what is do-able. However, you’d be wise to keep your dreams to yourself as the trolls and dream-stealers will be out there, ready to strike.

"
4 march 2017,leo,"Some ambitious plans of yours may need to be slowed down a bit now that Venus has retrograded in your optimistic sector of big thinking. However, this doesn’t mean that you should settle for table scraps and think small! By all means, let your creativity flow. But really think about the practical aspects of implementing them. In love, you may start feeling restless—and a little lusty too. Hmmm….time for a fling?

"
5 march 2017,leo,"Start getting clear about some ideas you’d like to pursue: a trip around the world, penning a novel, going back to school for an advanced degree, moving to a new location, starting a business or revamping your image. A superb Mars-Saturn aspect helps you think outside of the box. When Mars moves into your ambition sector this Thursday, swing into action.

"
6 march 2017,leo,"Want to see more green? As in–dinero? There are basically two types of income, active and passive. The passive kind falls under the eighth house, which for you is lit up like a Christmas tree all week. Today intelligent Mercury holds a conference with the Sun as they brainstorm ways to increase your bottom line: rental real estate, royalties, licensing, stock market investing, and creating a side business that doesn’t require a lot of time. Take this energy and run with it, leo–all the way to the bank.

"
7 march 2017,leo,"Sometimes you need to focus on minute details and strategy; other times it’s wiser to forget the little things while you let you mind think in big brush strokes. Today’s a “big picture thinking” kind of a day, so let your imagination and creativity rip. Your ideas have merit, and by mid-week you’ll be able to chunk them down into a plan.

"
8 march 2017,leo,"Dragging your feet as you accomplish projects or goals is no way to go about things, Leo. Fortunately your passion will rise this week as the Sun and Mercury are active in your house of loving life and getting things done with a sense of purpose and zeal. Sometimes you need to think of life as a game—a fun activity in which there are many winners, you being one of them.

"
9 march 2017,leo,"You are in one SWEET spot, Leo! Energetic Mars enters your house of ambition today for the first time in two years. Create a short list of the goals you’d like to achieve over the next six months and get to work on them. Better yet is the full moon that’s coming on the 12th which falls in your income sector. If career advancement and a higher income are on your list, this is a terrific time to pursue them. But from your chart it appears that you need to develop better daily habits and routines. Remain focused and don’t take on too much in too short a time.

"
10 march 2017,leo,"Some practical ways for boosting your net worth are available, Leo, but you’re going to have to do a little digging to find them. Fortunately Saturn, the planet of long term success, is stirring up your creative mojo. This energy continues over the weekend and peaks nicely with Sunday’s full moon in your earnings sector. You’re about to turn a corner in your financial life—make sure you’re paying attention to ideas that pop into your head.

"
12 march 2017,leo,"A luscious full moon could bring about major changes in your finances and career, Leo! Super-charged Mars just entered your ambition sector, and tonight’s lunation is in your house of income and savings. Some juicy new projects could come your way too. But the planets suggest that you become more disciplined in your habits, and that you don’t expect overnight success with cash pouring in the door. You can pull off a big coup if you develop routines that enable your talents to flow.

"
13 march 2017,leo,"Damn your chart looks good! Megawatt Mars just entered your house of goals and ambition last Thursday. Then last night there was a  full moon in your income sector. And today intelligent Mercury zips into the house of large scale thinking and planning. Let’s put it this way, Leo–aspects like these don’t come along every day. Your opportunity for making headway in your career and income are terrific.

"
14 march 2017,leo,"News or an unusual situation could come your way that might throw you off your game. Chances are it will happen at the workplace, but it could also be at home. Someone may resist your efforts or a project you’re working on, and it could be a person whom you wouldn’t have expected. This is a theme that will continue into next week, particularly around the 23rd, so it ain’t over tonight at sunset. Take it in stride and figure out how to get things done without them.

"
15 march 2017,leo,"It’s not your karma to be struggling financially, Leo. You won’t get to heaven faster that way, nor will you enjoy the trip on this side of the veil! A happy Moon-Mars aspect reminds you that you can earn more, live a better lifestyle and actually enjoy the journey.

"
16 march 2017,leo,"The Taoists say that the true master lives in the “center of the circle”, which is kind of like the eye of a hurricane. No matter what is going on around you, the key is to remain calm and unperturbed. Easier said than done, you say? Maybe! But a helpful Moon-Neptune aspect can put you in that place today. Once you get there, you’ll never want to leave.

"
17 march 2017,leo,"Falling in love—or expressing your love—can be rapturous. And with the Sun in the most passionate part of your chart, you may be ready to shout your love from the mountaintops. But wise old Saturn sternly advises you to simmer down and restrain yourself. From your chart it appears that you either need to learn more about your lover, reset your timetable or let the other person be demonstrative for once.

"
18 march 2017,leo,"The next two months could end up being a very expansive time for you, Leo. Your mind will turn to taking risks as you try new things, some of which may push you past your comfort zone. But all growth comes with a bit of a shock. You could get a taste of what’s coming today as brainiac Mercury meets up with magnetic Venus. Start dreaming up new ideas for the future, because when the Sun changes signs on Monday, a new chapter opens.

"
20 march 2017,leo,"If you find yourself craving more freedom and spontaneity, Leo, blame it on the Sun’s entry into Aries! You’re what is known as a fixed sign, not always open to change. But your eyes are going to be opened to new possibilities and perspectives over the next four weeks, and chances are you’ll take a risk and develop some exciting plans. It’s also a smart time to learn more and develop your talents.

"
21 march 2017,leo,"From your chart it appears that you have way too many projects going on and that it will be difficult to complete them all. Take a look at your habits and routines to see what you can change and streamline. Otherwise, some of your plans may need to be postponed until a further date. Try to do a few things with excellence rather than many things haphazardly.

"
22 march 2017,leo,"Try to accomplish as much as you can today with a project or work assignment, as the end of the week brings a rather difficult T-square. With the Moon and Pluto in your house of productivity, you are one efficient machine. Too bad your co-workers or family members aren’t, something that will become apparent over the next few days. Don’t wait for them to get their acts together–so your own thing.

"
23 march 2017,leo,"You’re about to enter a very organized phase in which being efficient at home and at work will mean a lot to you. Today the Moon makes it clear that in order to achieve your big plans, you have to have better habits and strategies. From your chart it appears that you’ve bitten off more than you can chew. Take a step back and consider ways to either cut out extraneous activities or find a better way to fit them into your schedule.

"
24 march 2017,leo,"Thanks to bountiful Jupiter in your house if thinking and speaking, you have no shortage of bright ideas, nor are you worried about sharing them. And with Mercury in your house of big picture concepts, you are also thinking outside the box. But you run the risk of being overwhelmed today with too may facts, brainstorms and paths to take. Spend the weekend creating a short list. Once the new moon arrives next Tuesday you can pick the best option or two, and then run with them.

"
25 march 2017,leo,"Feeling entrepreneurial? Ready to embark on an exciting trek to a new land? Willing to buckle down at a university or trade school in order to secure your future? A sense of optimism and adventure is building, Leo, and you’re in one heck of a sweet spot to run with it. Mars is providing you with the energy and ambition over the next few weeks, and today Venus will help you draw in the resources you need to make things happen.

"
26 march 2017,leo,"With motivator Mars blasting through the most ambitious part of your chart, you’re pretty much unstoppable these days, Leo. The best part is that planets in your blue-skies-ahead, big picture sector are active as well, helping you paint the future picture in bold brushstrokes. Today smart Mercury and spontaneous Uranus unite to blow the cobwebs from your mind and fill it with genius concepts.

"
27 march 2017,leo,"Nothing of value was ever achieved without passion, Leo, and you should possess it in abundance. The emotional Moon meets up with vibey Venus in your bold, brilliant ninth house of big picture thinking today, to be followed by a new moon tomorrow. This is one of your best times all year to take ideas and run with them. The worldwide stage awaits.

"
28 march 2017,leo,"Despite Leo’s reputation for being proud and fierce, you’re not as adventurous as the other signs, preferring to relax in your lair. Which is fine—unless the lair becomes a rut. Well, the cosmos is hell bent on expanding your world, which starts with expanding your viewpoint. The new moon in Aries will jumpstart a new chapter in which you’ll start to become more curious and motivated to try new things: vacation destinations, a brand new occupation, a different self-image, reading books and socializing with folks who are a different breed than the usual.

"
29 march 2017,leo,"Something that you’ve been working on is now at a place where you have to give it more effort, and fortunately the cosmos is by your side. An energetic meeting between Mercury and Saturn will boost your creativity and overall vision to greater heights. It’s all about thinking on a grander scale, Leo. Small thoughts create wimpy results, and you don’t settle for table scraps!

"
30 march 2017,leo,"Can’t see the forest for the trees? That may happen as a confusing Jupiter-Pluto aspect turns your focus to the small stuff instead of the bigger picture. It may not be your fault, however—colleagues or family members may be so bogged down in minutiae that they pull you into it as well. Don’t worry—intelligent Mercury enters your ambition sector tomorrow, so you’ll regain your focus within the next 24 hours.

"
31 march 2017,leo,"Your motivation level has undoubtedly increased thanks to hosting red hot Mars in your ambition sector over the past few weeks. Get ready for a second blast of energy as Mercury buzzes in there today too. This is one of your best times all year to make progress with all of your big plans, but try to get as much done as you can now. Pay attention to details too, as Mercury will be retrograding on April 9th.

"
1 april 2017,leo,"It’s all fine and good to dream about working a better job, changing occupations or starting your own business—but what about the money component? What kind of income can you expect to earn? Now that Venus is just about ready to backslide into your net worth sector, you need to seriously consider the bottom line. Maybe you can start a side business while staying at the day job. Perhaps some kind of passive income stream would be the way to go. Consider your options between  now and April 15th, at which time you can start taking action.

"
2 april 2017,leo,"It’s time to release the past when it comes to romance, Leo: grudges, resentment, that torch you’re still carrying or fears of getting intimate. Whether it’s a lover who hurt you years ago or a current amour who’s pushing your buttons, you need to make a decision about the kind of life you intend to live. Love planet Venus is now retrograding though your intimate and emotional eighth house til the 15th. Are you going to choose happiness, or drama?

"
3 april 2017,leo,"The planets are trying to push you past your comfort zone, something that we all need from time to time. But the usually fearless lion seems stuck in a comfortable groove, whether it’s in matters of the heart, career, family or residence. Well, that’s about to change, Leo. With four planets going retrograde this month you’ll be doing a lot of reflecting about where you are and what needs to change.

"
4 april 2017,leo,"You’re rather obsessive these days about achieving your goals, thanks to assertive Mars barreling through your house of ambition. But you run the risk of burning out, mentally and emotionally more than physically. You must  take some down time to relax and regroup. When Saturn begins to retrograde on Thursday in your house of living life to the fullest, you’ll learn some valuable lessons about stopping to smell the roses.

"
5 april 2017,leo,"With the Moon in your sign you may be feeling more focused than usual on your needs and image. Fortunately inspirational Neptune is standing along the sidelines, encouraging you to get in touch with a more sensual, artistic and even metaphysical side. It’s never too late to nurture that side of yourself.

"
6 april 2017,leo,"Celibacy may actually be looking like an option now that Saturn is back stroking through your house of amour! While I’m joking a bit here, the reality is that all lions will be reconsidering their love lives. You may be wondering if a relationship is worth it or if you’re with the right person. Married Leos could feel that the sizzle has gone out of the union. But Saturn is the planet of long term stability, so if you put some effort into making things work you can experience progress.

"
7 april 2017,leo,"Diplomacy is the word o’ the day, Leo! Unless you want to make enemies, watch that you don’t bloviate, bluff or schmooze. You could also be at the receiving end of someone who’s blowing a lot of smoke in your direction. The smartest thing to do is to say as little as possible, be it verbally or in writing—which includes e-mails, texts and contracts.

"
8 april 2017,leo,"Creative projects and other matters that involve talent can really start to soar, Leo. The full moon on Tuesday in your third house of self-expression allows you to dazzle. But you can’t just be all ideas and no grunt work. Take your ideas and figure out the specific tasks that need to be accomplished in order to take them from the concept stage to reality.

"
9 april 2017,leo,"Even though the two most unstoppable planets–Mars and Pluto–met up in your efficiency sector a few days ago, inspiring you to blast forward with your plans, you need to pause and reflect. Mercury retrogrades today in your house of ambition, telling you to cool your jets. Between now and April 20th you should be asking yourself if you’re going about things the right way. Make the necessary changes and move on.

"
10 april 2017,leo,"Got an idea that you’d like to run with? Then go for it, Leo! And stay away from dream stealers who will tell you that it’s impossible or can’t be done. Tomorrow’s full moon is the perfect aspect for launching a pet project or plan. Don’t listen to people who are so set in their own ways that they can’s see past the end of their noses.

"
11 april 2017,leo,"A sparkling full moon in Libra is just the ticket for making presentations, expressing your opinion and promoting your brand or company. Better yet is the strong presence of Saturn in your talent sector, which will allow you to develop even more skills. The key to finessing this lunation is to take your time, do things right, work independently and don’t expect overnight success. Do that and you’ll get results.

"
12 april 2017,leo,"Generosity is a treasured asset, Leo, and today’s Moon-Neptune aspect will open up your heart to helping others in need, whether it’s a kind word or a financial gift. But your sign is known for being excessive at times, so limit your largesse. It’s one thing to be a giver and another to be an enabler.

"
13 april 2017,leo,"A friend of famed artist Georgia O’Keeffe said that she “never allowed her life to be one thing and her painting another. She has never left her life in disorder while she sat down to paint.” Neatness and minimalism were found in her home, just as it was part of her art. The planets are urging you to create a home environment that is streamlined and functional.

"
14 april 2017,leo,"You’re in quite a brainy mood this week, thanks to the recent full moon in your house of self-expression. And today brilliant ideas pour in, thanks to a powerful Sun-Uranus conjunction. Uranus is the planet of genius, so get ready for innovative perceptions and concepts to come your way. Then go loud and proud with them. Next week the Sun enters the most ambitious part of your chart; consider today’s conjunction as an early gift from the cosmos.

"
15 april 2017,leo,"Cue the BeeGees, circa 1977: How deep is your love? That’s been the question over the past month as romantic Venus was retrograde in your house of intimacy. It stations direct today, helping to end drama, confusion and unhappy emotions. Truth be told, if a romance isn’t putting a smile on your face it may be time to vamanos. But today’s aspect could also open up a new chapter of relating and sexual closeness.

"
16 april 2017,leo,"Your eyes will be opened to new possibilities this weekend, thanks to a happy Venus-Mars meet up. This includes romance as well as career and money-making opportunities, so pay attention to any thoughts that pop into your mind, even if they seem random. Now that Venus is direct in your house of intimacy and  wealth you can score big in both areas.

"
17 april 2017,leo,"You’ve never been one to follow the herd. Heck no, you feel most comfortable being a leader, and today’s Sun-Saturn convo puts you front and center. A megawatt trine, the best angle possible, helps you shape a creative vision and run with it. In the near future people will come into your life who are noticing your ideas. Be ready to show them how good you are.

"
18 april 2017,leo,"There’s an old saying: you can either have your own plan for what you’d like to see happen, or you can be a part of someone else’s plan. The cosmos is urging you, fierce lion, to start taking more control over matters, especially at the workplace. While no one’s telling you to become a tyrant–and you can’t magically make obnoxious co-workers and bosses disappear–you can still try to develop a greater sense of control, even if that simply means your emotions or how you manage your time.

"
19 april 2017,leo,"It’s time to pounce, lion! The Sun has entered your house of ambition, so no cat napping for you over the next four weeks. Your optimism and desire for progress will increase significantly, but don’t expect overnight success. Four planets in retrograde are going to force you to examine all of your plans with a microscope before they can really pick up speed. But that’s OK: moving too quickly often produces mistakes, and they cost time and money.

"
20 april 2017,leo,"You’re raring to go, lion, as the Sun makes its annual trek through your ambition sector. Problem is, Pluto retrogrades in the house that governs your habits, systems and the people you rely on to help you get your job done. Before you plunge headlong into a new endeavor, examine your routines for weaknesses and take care of them. Slacker employees? Get rid of them. Slacker co-workers? Steer clear and do your own thing. Pluto governs hidden snarky types so you may become aware of a few in the office. Keep calm and carry on.

"
21 april 2017,leo,"Lions are interesting animals: they can act as a lone predator, quietly stalking their prey (or ambitions), but they also know how to hang with their tribe. Over the next few weeks it would be in your best interest to be a team player as Mars has entered your house of networking. It should also be a social time too, so bring on the brunches, cocktails and long chats with friends. This sector also governs technology, so you can really kick butt with a website launch or social media campaign—not to mention finding love online.

"
23 april 2017,leo,"A sexy, soulful day is ahead with the passionate Moon and Venus meeting up in your house of intimacy and libido. Push your household chores to the side and simply enjoy the presence of your loved one. Single, or not happy in love? Then take good care of yourself. This is also the sector of emotional healing, so modalities like meditation, reiki, and good old fashioned massages at the spa can help you get relaxed and grounded again.

"
24 april 2017,leo,"Doing things the same old way may have worked for you in the past, Leo, but the cosmos is telling you to go deep into your well of creativity and think in more innovative ways. A new moon is coming on Wednesday in your career and goal sector, enabling you to take your ideas and run with them. However, a stunning Mercury-Saturn trine today in the most creative parts of your chart suggests that you start thinking outside the box. Expand your mind to experience a different level of success.

"
25 april 2017,leo,"You’re entering one of the most creative phases of 2017, Leo, welcome news as your sign is known for being the artistes  of the zodiac. A superb meeting of rule-breaker Uranus and disciplined Saturn encourages you to take a different approach to the way you go about your job, decorate your home, the way you dress, and in general, the manner in which you express yourself. If signing up for a class or working with a coach would be the best way to develop your talent, then do so, as the results will pay off big time.

"
26 april 2017,leo,"“In the jungle, the quiet jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…”  Remember that song? Consider it a past memory, Leo, because you won’t be lounging around sleeping for the next few months. Au contraire, the cosmos is lighting a fire under your feline rear end to get moving. Today’s new moon occurs in your house of ambition and success. This is your annual gift from the heavens to manifest the things that are the most important to you. And you won’t be thinking small, either: magnetic Venus will be gliding into your big-picture thinking sector on Friday.

"
27 april 2017,leo,"The new moon yesterday kicked off one of the most ambitious periods of the year for you, Leo, and you shouldn’t be wasting a moment of it. Today is the perfect time to gain control of your physical workplace, from the piles of paper on your desk to your e-mail inbox. You won’t be able to achieve your goals with lousy habits and routines. A strong Pluto aspect tells you to get the nitty gritty done first.

"
28 april 2017,leo,"The great big world beckons, Leo, so it’s time to slink out of your lair and be a part of a bigger scene. Venus has just entered your expansive ninth house of international affairs, publishing, media attention, earning a higher degree and extensive travel. It just so happens that this sector includes love and money, and we’re not talking about boring dates and chump change. You want the sweeter things in life? Hunt them down and make them yours.

"
29 april 2017,leo,"What you want to do with your life is your choice, Leo, and is not up for discussion with the people in your world. They may need to be reminded of that fact, unfortunately. You have a lot of planetary energy pushing you to achieve things—big things at that. If your friends, family of lover are threatened by your ambitious attitude, that’s their problem, not yours.

"
30 april 2017,leo,"Take a few steps back in order to leap miles ahead, Leo. The recent new moon in your ambitious tenth house is stirring your desire to get ahead, that’s for sure. But some quiet strategizing is in order as the intuitive Moon glides through the part of your chart that deals with reflection. Work out the details now before you take that leap.

"
1 may 2017,leo,"An unexpected development might occur in one of your biggest plans, something that catches you off guard. It could be finding out that the college of your choice has waitlisted you. Your citizenship application may have gotten held up. Travel plans have to be rescheduled. Whatever it is, you may feel deflated or emotional, but chill. Once Mercury resumes direct motion on Wednesday things will bolt forward.

"
2 may 2017,leo,"Yeah, baby! The Moon is in your sign and it’s winking at red hot Mars. This is a super aspect for networking with other people, so make plans for Sunday brunch or Friday night cocktails. Head off to a seminar, trade show or convention where people will be congregating who share your interests. Go to a singles event, church group meeting or get involved in charity work. Your life is about to get a whole lot bigger.

"
3 may 2017,leo,"The brakes come off now that Mercury is finally direct in the most freewheeling, visionary part of your chart. Whether you want to travel around the world, go back to school, become the next Bill Gates or join the Peace Corps, you can take action. Inspirational Neptune is in a terrific spot, helping you think in bolder terms than usual. But with the Sun in structured Taurus you’ll also possess logical thought.

"
4 may 2017,leo,"Your financial future is connected to how much risk you’re willing to take, Leo. You’re a fixed sign by nature, not always willing to bolt out of your comfort zone. A gentle Venus-Moon aspect asks you to reconsider your options and to take a wider view. Are you truly happy in your line of work, for example? You may be surprised to find that you could earn more in an occupation that’s a better match for your talent.

"
6 may 2017,leo,"Mental stumbling blocks may be getting in your way, Leo, especially when it comes to making money. You may be thinking that you don’t have the creativity or the know-how in order to make the serious stuff. But wealth is in your grasp, and with the Sun touring the most ambitious part of your chart you’re in a super position to land big bucks. Seek out the advice you need or take classes to develop your talents.

"
7 may 2017,leo,"Feeling flirty…and maybe a little dirty? It’s quite possible with the passionate Moon snuggling up to juicy Jupiter in your house of conversation! Everyone thinks that the typical Leo is a sexy creature, always slinking around confidently, just oozing allure. But there are quiet, more restrained Leos out there. The cosmos tells you to start working your sex appeal in a slightly more apparent way.

"
8 may 2017,leo,"Pretend that you’re a politician being interviewed and that everything you say will be scrutinized and disseminated. That’s the game to play today with a stinky Moon-Mercury opposition, which is another way of saying, “Loose lips sink ships!” Keep your remarks (both verbal and written) short, factual and logical. Keep emotions out of the mix. Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to vent later in the week.

"
9 may 2017,leo,"Ready to assume the role of captain of the ship? Good, because the planets want to put you there! A fabulous meeting of the two most authoritative orbs, the Sun and Pluto, helps put you at the helm. The next few days are superb for showcasing your talent, interviewing for a new job or taking charge of a group effort. It’s also a smart time to strategize, and from your chart it looks like world domination is the end goal.

"
10 may 2017,leo,"Tonight’s full moon could tug at you from all directions, Leo! It occurs in your cozy, domestic sector of home and family. There is a strong nesting vibe at play, encouraging you to settle down, redecorate or even move to new digs. But at the same time ultra-spontaneous Uranus is acting up, saying “WTF? Take a risk, babe! It’s time for some adventure.”  So what’s a lion to do? The choice is yours to make. Mega watt Mars is blasting through the house that governs your fondest hopes and dreams, so pick the top one and go after it.

"
11 may 2017,leo,"You’re one ambitious soul these days thanks to the Sun blazing a path through your house of goals and success. And today El Sol forms a glorious aspect with power broker Pluto, helping you make progress. This is an excellent time to reach out to decision makers, land a more prestigious position or score a new assignment that will build your reputation. Intelligent Mercury is pushing you to think in creative new ways from its perching your visionary ninth house, so sticking to the tried and true—even though it may be working just fine, thank you very much—may actually hold you back a bit. Don’t be afraid to take a calculated risk.

"
12 may 2017,leo,"The planet of motivation meets up with the planet of abundance today, an auspicious aspect for setting things in motion that are important to you. Mars and Jupiter form a trine in the heavens, the best angle possible in astrology. With Mars in the house of self-expression and Jupiter in the networking sector, your best chances for success are by joining forces with others, rather than trying to go it alone. Find a coach or a mentor. Talk to as many people as you can. Don’t be shy about self promotion (like that should be a problem for a Leo, duh). Want media attention? It could happen.

"
13 may 2017,leo,"When the emotional Moon meets up with mature and disciplined Saturn, sometimes a clash ensues. But these two orbs conjunct in your house of creativity and romance today which is fabulous! In matters of the heart you can find long lasting commitment, full of passion but without childish antics. And you’re also encouraged to take that same passion and apply it to your career and other big ambitions. Schedule regular brainstorming sessions, or time in the studio, or weekend hours just to chill with your hobbies.

"
14 may 2017,leo,"Taking on too much of a friend’s problems? It’s nice to be a shoulder for someone else to cry on, whether it’s a pal, co-worker or family member. But sometimes you just have to let some people figure things out for themselves. This isn’t cruel; folks need to learn from their own mistakes and problems and develop their own wisdom. Besides, your sign has a tendency to want to rush in and fix everything. Don’t.

"
15 may 2017,leo,"Motivation strikes today and hits hard! Whether you decide to clean out the black holes otherwise known as your closets, start working out (for real this time), or catch up on old work assignments, you’ll be working with the energy of the cosmos. Tough guy Pluto is acting like a boot camp instructor, kicking your sorry feline ass into action. Good thing, too—Mercury enters your house of ambition tomorrow.

"
17 may 2017,leo,"You’re a proud creature with healthy self-esteem, but you’d be wise to remember that you’ll need the cooperation of others to get ahead in this world. The Moon in Gemini will help you find the most diplomatic way of connecting with folks, whether it’s in business, your family or your love life. If you have a point you need to get across do so before Friday, when a stinky opposition will close off others’ minds for a few days.

"
18 may 2017,leo,"Confusion is in the air over the next few days, Leo. It could come from within—you may not be able to make a decision about a long term plan or big vision that you’re working on. Or it could come from the people around you, who seem to be hell bent on talking in circles and possibly bulls***ting you along the way. But sit tight. Once the Sun rolls into Gemini on Saturday the mist will clear and so will the path ahead.

"
19 may 2017,leo,"From your chart it appears that you’ve been laboring away at something that’s close to your heart, wondering when the glorious day will appear when you can take this dream and run with it. Well, that day is here, Leo, as Saturn and Uranus form the most beneficial aspect possible, a trine. Whether the dream is to find love, get a book published, travel around the world, have your art showcased in a gallery, conceive a baby, or launch a killer blog, “someday” is here. These two planets will be traveling close to each other between now and November, when this rare aspect will repeat once more. Use the next six months for one last push.

"
20 may 2017,leo,"The mighty lion likes to travel with its tribe, and now that the Sun is in Gemini you’re in the perfect spot to socialize. Gemini is your house of teamwork and networking too, not just partying with your pals. Spend the next four weeks expanding your contact list, whether it’s for business, volunteer work, getting to know the neighbors or looking for love. This is also your tech sector, so any kind of internet-based project should really pick up momentum between now and the Cancer time period.

"
21 may 2017,leo,"Sometimes you need to rally the troops (kids, co-workers, friends) and sometimes you just have to rally yourself. The good news is that this week’s planetary energy is all about developing momentum, and it starts today with the Moon in energetic Aries. So get your pep talk ready, and if that means talking to yourself in more positive terms–affirmations, thinking happier thoughts, experiencing gratitude–then so be it.

"
22 may 2017,leo,"Nothing of value is ever achieved without passion and you should have it in spades today, Leo. Magnetic Venus meets up with the ardent Moon, fueling your desire to live life a lot more authentically. Why sit along the sidelines watching everyone else have a life? Lucky for you, this Thursday’s new moon will stoke you even more to chase after rainbows.

"
23 may 2017,leo,"There’s something called “the creative process”, Leo, something that your sign is well aware of. After all, you’re the artists and innovators of the zodiac. But it can’t be rushed! With disciplined Saturn spending only seven more months in your house of talent, you should be focusing on developing your skills rather than chasing after the end goal. It doesn’t matter if you’re trying to become a better parent, graphic artist, CEO or gardener—put in the grunt work and the results will take care of themselves.

"
24 may 2017,leo,"Tough guy Pluto is in your house of habits and efficiency, playing the role of boot camp instructor who tells you to drop to the floor and do 100 pushups. Except he’s telling you to get caught up on your errands, e-mails, and work projects. Oh, and while you’re at it, get back on the old diet and exercise routine. With the Moon in the most ambitious part of your chart you might actually feel like doing the grunt work! Until tomorrow, when lazy Venus feels like slacking. Keep your eye on the prize.

"
25 may 2017,leo,"You’re usually pretty comfortable being the leader of the pack, a good thing considering today’s new moon in the teamwork part of your chart. Even if you prefer to go it alone, over the next few weeks you may still have to collaborate or make nice with others. You’re going to need a lot of diplomacy as a tough Venus-Pluto aspect indicates that there are malcontents in your midst. That’s OK: with energetic Mars in this part of your chart also you’ll be able to get things done. Just don’t mow people over.

"
26 may 2017,leo,"You’ll be in a highly philosophical mood today and over the weekend, Leo, and this is a good thing. Don’t worry, you won’t spend Memorial Day weekend with your nose in a book written by Descartes or Jean-Paul Sartre. This is a happier, more bubbly mood in which you take on a different kind of attitude, living for the now rather than the future. But feel free to read a helpful book if it helps you gain the right perspective.

"
27 may 2017,leo,"You weren’t put on this planet to be a work horse or someone’s maid, and the recent new moon should have reminded you of that fact! It occurred in one of the most festive parts of your chart so clear your schedule for some good times. It’s time to be a bit more adventurous in your tastes, whether that means in lovers, the kind of clothes you wear or the places you go for relaxation and culture. If anyone is cramping your style it’s time for a reality check.

"
28 may 2017,leo,"Is there something that you’ve been interested in doing for years…but you never had the guts? Or maybe you were lacking the funds or the connections. Perhaps you were mired in emotional dramas that took up too much of your time and energy. Neptune is inspiring you to find the right solution and move past the limitations.

"
29 may 2017,leo,"Setting boundaries with other people is not necessarily your strong suit. You tend to be fiercely loyal even to those who haven’t been the best of friends or lovers, giving them plenty of chances to redeem themselves. But things may be reaching critical mass in a particular relationship and it may be time to pull away. This doesn’t mean ending the connection. A cool breeze coming from your direction may be all it takes to make someone wake up.

"
30 may 2017,leo,"Your spirits will rise considerably, thanks to a happy meeting between energetic Mars and spunky Uranus in the two  most buoyant parts of your chart. Take this energy and run with it, Leo! You’ve been carrying a heavier load than usual over the past few months and it’s time to let your hair down a little. Shake that mane and think about some new possibilities.

"
31 may 2017,leo,"You can focus on the trivial nonsense that comes your way–from family, co-workers, the news media or your pals–or you can focus on what’s most important and get things done. Buddha said that we become what we think about. Consider that wise advice the next time you’re tempted to indulge in minutiae.

"
1 june 2017,leo,"Staid Saturn has been in your house of skill development and talent over the past two years, demanding that you pay attention to your “craft”, whatever that might be: being a fabulous mom, an organized and productive employee or a savvy business owner. Today Venus adds a sizzling dose of creativity to your efforts. Don’t stick with the tried and true; add some some fresh new techniques to your repertoire.

"
1 june 2016,leo,"The Sun and Venus are pushing you to go after your dreams, and so you should! But a tough angle today between the Sun and Neptune could throw up a roadblock. You may realize that you need more cash to finance a big plan. Perhaps the issue isn’t money, but a shortage of creative ideas. Neptune does control inspiration, and she may be withholding her gifts over the next few days. Have no fear. The roadblocks start to disappear next Monday.

"
2 june 2017,leo,"Yowza! You have no shortage of ideas, that’s for sure. With optimistic Jupiter stirring up your brainy side, the problem is figuring out which idea to go after first. The best bet under current planetary auspices is to run your thoughts past a seasoned expert or friend who can point out the flaws and genius in your plans. The good news is that charismatic Venus enters your house of ambition next week, so you’ll be able to draw the right people and resources to you.

"
2 june 2016,leo,"Were you put on this earth to work a sh** job? Are you destined to be a corporate drone, slogging away every day just to make someone rich? Were you an axe murderer in a former life and now your karma is to suffer? No, no and NO! Come on, Leo. You were destined for bigger things than this, and today’s Moon-North Node angle is going to point that out to you. Not only that, inspirational Neptune is in a super angle, helping you come up with fresh new ideas for your future.

"
3 june 2017,leo,"Forget about thinking “out of the box”. Leos are able to think outside of this galaxy, thanks to a powerful meeting of Uranus and Venus. Uranus is known as the planet of genius, the orb that has inspired everyone from Einstein to Jobs to Mother Teresa. And with Venus nearby, taking brilliant new ideas and running with them should be easier than ever. Our golden girl is all about taking the silky smooth path, rather than the one loaded with pot holes. But you might want to keep your brainstorms to yourself, at least for a month or two. Mars enters your secretive twelfth house tomorrow, so discretion is key.

"
3 june 2016,leo,"Aargh! it’s a planetary pissfest with five planets pulling and tugging on each other in a Grand Cross. What’s a regal lion to do? Let’s face it, you’re not exactly the wallflower of the zodiac. You adore the finer things in life and like to spend time with both friends and lovers alike. But the Sun and Venus in your house of pals is annoyed with Saturn in your house of love. Why can’t we all get along—and open up that bottle of Cristal together? Oh, by the way—Pluto in your financial security department is questioning the need for Cristal when a bottle of cheap Asti will do instead. Or maybe the wine that comes in a box. Yup, you’re going to have to scale back a bit when it comes to spending, and make some decisions about the people you hang with. It’s not like solving the crisis in the Middle East but it’s still a pain!

"
4 june 2017,leo,"Lions know how and when to pounce: on an opportunity, an enemy or just having a good time. But do you know how to pull back and go within, regal one? Even a proud Leo is nursing past traumas, habits that need to be broken or negative thought patterns that need to be broken. The problem is that your pride will often prevent you from admitting your issues to others, so you’ll have to do some important inner work by yourself. That’s OK. You have the chops to do it. The upside is that you’ll emerge at birthday time stronger, happier and more serene for your efforts.

"
5 june 2017,leo,"Teamwork could get a bit tricky with a Neptune-Sun square. There seems to be a big divide between those who think rationally and those who are in fantasy land. This can really get dicey if money or budgets are involved, so stay on your toes. Be discerning about what you share with others and how committed you want to be with this group or relationship.

"
6 june 2017,leo,"Yeah, baby! Profits planet Venus enters your house of ambition and success. Sometimes going after what we want can seem like scaling Mount Everest, full of pitfalls, long hours and gritted teeth. But with Venus now in this part of your chart a sense of relaxation and ease should start to seep into your daily efforts. If you believe in the power of attraction, now is the time to put it into play.

"
7 june 2017,leo,"The old saying, “It’s now what you know but who you know” applies to lions these days. Strategic Mercury is now in your house of networking, whether you schmooze potential clients or party with your friends. A BFF could be instrumental in introducing you to a new love, tipping you off about a job opening or serve as a good sounding board. It’s also an excellent time to find a mentor, coach or join a mastermind group. Work your connections as best you can between now and the 21st.

"
8 june 2017,leo,"Relating to loved ones gets easier with a sweet Jupiter-Neptune aspect. Sometimes you just have to stop worrying about things that may never happen, and let the negativity of the past be a distant memory. A new chapter is about to begin in your personal life after Friday’s full moon. Listen to what others have to say and think about how you’d like the next year to progress with these folks.

"
10 june 2017,leo,"You’re in a bit of an odd spot, Leo. Mars just entered your hush-hush twelfth house, the place where we work best in solitude. But happy-go-lucky Jupiter resumes direct motion in your chatty communications sector. The best way to finesse this energy is to diligently work on any project that deals with self-expression behind closed doors, at least for now. Polish up your portfolio or resume. Strategize. Learn how to work Photoshop or a graphic arts program—or hire a designer to work their magic on your promotional pieces. Develop a product line. Refresh your brand. Inspiration will be running high, spot take advantage of it.

"
11 june 2017,leo,"The North Node of the Moon points out the path we should take in our life’s journey. Today the Node is active, telling you to take a more creative approach. This could be in the way you dress or cook, all the way to your choice of occupation. Study the lives of people who’ve marched to the beat of their own drum for inspiration.

"
12 june 2017,leo,"Now that Jupiter is direct your ability to be diplomatic has returned, so use it to your advantage. This is especially true when it comes to networking with other people or cooperating with clients and co-workers. You may not agree with them—heck, you may not even like them!—but sometimes you just need to put that aside. You’ll be more serene as a result.

"
13 june 2017,leo,"Despite your valiant efforts to be a team player, others may not be willing to play along. This is true of lovers, family members, co-workers or people you deal with on a volunteer basis. Some may report to emotional blackmail, passive aggressive BS or deception. This is a theme that reoccurs over the next two weeks, so go into “wise sage” mode and say as little as possible. The ancient Taoists said that the true master “resides in the center of the circle”; stay in the eye of the hurricane and you’ll remain at peace.

"
14 june 2017,leo,"Tap in to your own wisdom these days, Leo, as it will provide you with better guidance than the people around you can. Sometimes the stars suggest finding a mentor or talking to a close confidante; other times they advise that you rely on yourself. The latter is important this week and next. Listen to what others have to say, but primarily rely on your own judgment.

"
15 june 2017,leo,"With wise Saturn, the planet known as the teacher of the solar system, active in your creativity sector, you should have no shortage of bright ideas. And if you’re smart you should be devoting time every day to developing your craft. But a Sun-Saturn opposition today indicates that there is more that needs to be done. Are team members doing their share? Is it time to hook up with a mentor for some stellar advice? Consider what other people can and should be bringing to the table.

"
16 june 2017,leo,"The languid lion can often be rather blasé about their finances, but that’s about to change. Neptune retrogrades today in your net worth and wealth sector, telling you to snap out of it! Be careful before investing your time and money in a venture. Study your bank and credit card statements. Carefully vet big ticket spending, such as buying a house. Obfuscation runs high with this aspect, so don’t let someone sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.

"
17 june 2017,leo,"You’re entering a deep period of psychic and emotional awareness, Leo, one of the most intense in years. Over the next week alone you may decide to cut off the outside world to a certain extent and go within. You would be wise to do so. With so much planetary firepower arriving in late July and through most of August, you need to get clear about your journey.

"
18 june 2017,leo,"Your dreams can take flight, Leo. The Sun is currently in the part of your chart that deals with your fondest hopes and wishes, and today it shakes hands with genius Uranus in the most adventurous sector there is. This is no time for holding back! But with the Sun about to enter Cancer, plan cautiously before you proceed. No Icarus-type thinking allowed.

"
19 june 2017,leo,"Are you and someone close on the same wavelength? From your chart it appears that some friction has arisen due to fundamental differences in opinion or values. This doesn’t need to be a deal breaker, but if a relationship is fraught with too many problems or inconsistencies it may be time to reconsider the union.

"
20 june 2017,leo,"A smart idea can become a brilliant one under today’s cosmic aspects, Leo! This is no time for thinking small. Let your imagination rip, then get ready for working in seclusion. The Sun enters the most confidential part of your chart tomorrow, the place where we hole ourselves away and create a magnum opus.

"
21 june 2017,leo,"The Cancer season is here, typically the quietest time of the year for you. Maybe not on the outside—your daily schedule may be as busy as ever—but mentally. Pull away from the madding crowd a bit and do some deep reflecting about where you’re heading next in your life. Leo, you have some amazing  planetary aspects coming your way in four weeks. Make sure that you’re emotionally and mentally ready to take advantage of them.

"
22 june 2017,leo,"The fierce lion tends to tackle problems head on—which means poised and ready to strike. But now that shrewd Mercury is in your secluded house of working behind the scenes, it’s time to get away from full frontal behavior. You know how to quietly sit on your haunches and observe your prey. Conserve your energy.

"
23 june 2017,leo,"Sometimes we get so caught up in thinking about what’s going wrong in our lives that we can’t see (or appreciate) what’s going right. Fortunately the emotional Moon meets up with two illuminating and logical orbs, the Sun and Mercury, in the house of psychological health. You’re in an excellent spot to see things for the way they really are.

"
24 june 2017,leo,"Today brings the annual new moon in the sector that encourages you to let go of people, habits, thought patterns and circumstances that are no longer helping you on your path. With Venus in a good supporting role, you can take control of your life without a lot of drama and anxiety. Not everyone may support your new direction, but chances are they’re the people who need to go!

"
25 june 2017,leo,"Got a gut feeling about something or someone? Then double check it and be sure to use rational thinking when you do. Your intuition may be off today due to a Mars-Jupiter square, and a similar aspect shows up again on Tuesday. But on Wednesday it should be right on target, so wait til then before making any big decisions.

"
26 june 2017,leo,"Trusting your own thoughts and gut feelings becomes easier with a magnificent Mars-Neptune trine. Take note: your intuition will be razor sharp this week, so listen to what it has to say rather than the advice of others. People may try to sway you to their way of thinking, or bamboozle you with bulls***, but your own internal guidance system will be spot on.

"
27 june 2017,leo,"You have some big decisions to make Leo, but these are not the outwardly noticeable kind, like moving to a new city or losing weight. These have to do with your mental health and the kind of thoughts you allow to occupy your mind. It’s time to take out the emotional trash. Are you brave enough to release your victim stories?

"
27 june 2016,leo,"My, my, don’t we have a mystery woman or man on the prowl! As Mercury joins Venus in the most secluded part of your chart, you can stalk your prey (romantic or business, choose your victim!) without leaving a trace. Neptune’s dreamy presence indicates that you could be feeling quite sexy in the process. Do you want that martini shaken, or stirred?

"
28 june 2017,leo,"Done. Completely done. That’s the mood today as the cosmos serves up a powerful aspect, that of intelligent Mercury meeting up with ambitious Mars in the house of your subconscious mind. Bon voyage, bad habits. Hasta la vista, toxic ties. Buh bye feeling sad and gloomy. This lion’s ready to move on.

"
28 june 2016,leo,"Time for Plan B. Jupiter’s been in your corner for the last ten months, aiming to increase your income. A helpful angle between Jupiter and the Moon suggests that it’s time to tweak your plans a bit for maximum impact. Pluto tells you that doing things the same old way is just going to give you the same old results.

"
29 june 2017,leo,"Old habits die hard, something that may become apparent with a harsh Mercury-Pluto opposition! Scientists say that our habits actually create “neural pathways” in the brain, like a well-traveled road your mind wants to travel. Remember this if you’re trying to make changes. That old “roadway” needs to be torn up and a new one built in its place.

"
29 june 2016,leo,"“Aha!” moments can hit us at the most unexpected times, and today could provide one of those brief moments of illumination. The Moon swings past high-charged Uranus in the most free-thinking part of your chart, so don’t be surprised if a fresh new concept or understanding comes your way. Better yet? La Luna scampers into your ambition sector a few hours later, pushing you to take that nugget of inspiration and do something with it!

"
30 june 2017,leo,"Getting out of your own way is key over the next few weeks, lion. Listen, unless you go the Henry David Thoreau route and live in the woods by yourself, there will always be people around you with agendas and attitudes. But the #1 person you need to “tackle” is yourself. Do the important inner work now and reap the rewards by your birthday.

"
30 june 2016,leo,"Let your inner radar be your guide. A tough opposition between Venus and Pluto could cause you to doubt someone’s motives. It doesn’t mean, however, that someone is deliberately trying to deceive you, but there may be an undercurrent that you need to keep an eye on.

"
1 july 2017,leo,"Be kinder to yourself, Leo! A sweet lunar aspect suggests that you’ve been putting yourself down, and it’s time for some self love. Quit worrying about what everyone else is thinking and doing and just focus on you for awhile.

"
1 july 2016,leo,"Sshhhh! Got a business plan or idea rolling around in that brain of yours? If so, get moving with it, but keep the details to yourself. As a matter of fact, Leo, the first two weeks of July demand that you keep your lips zipped about everything.  A host of planets in your confidentiality sector are working on your behalf, from love to money to career and health, but you don’t need to go public on Facebook with the scoop. Today is all about making more money, and the best source of advice and wisdom is your own intuition.

"
2 july 2017,leo,"You’re currently in quite a practical place, Leo, in all areas of your life. The cosmos is demanding that you tighten up your routines and habits, get your house in order and finish incomplete tasks at the office. And this may mean doing some inner work as well. Procrastination, feeling overwhelmed, and refusing to deal with the reality of your responsibilities has to go. The full moon on the 8th will make that clear!

"
2 july 2016,leo,"No sign of the zodiac has more secrets than you right now, Leo! Your mind is privately ruminating, assessing, analyzing and projecting into the future. It’s not so much that you’re hiding anything, but keeping your thoughts to yourself. And today you will be considering the children in your life and a lover (or the lack of one). The planets suggest that you need to readjust the manner in which you deal with these folks and your emotions. Any Leo in an artistic field should be considering their craft and the best way to perfect it, demonstrate it, and profit by it.

"
3 july 2017,leo,"Feeling more settled and secure at home base is on the planets’ agenda today for you, Leo. Whether a pressing family issue is taken care of or you just start to feel more relaxed and at peace, this is a good day to chill out and take good care of you.

"
3 july 2016,leo,"Neptune is known for creating confusion, and now that it’s retrograde there may be conundrums spinning through your head that you’re trying to sort out. Relief is on the way, thanks to a strong Sun-Neptune trine that will help clear up matters. Things will become even clearer on Tuesday.

"
4 july 2017,leo,"The connections you make in July could be quite important, Leo, so make an attempt to meet new people–whether it’s in person or online. Venus has just entered your house of networking and friendship, a superb aspect for sharing ideas (and cocktails) with like minded people. Don’t share too much too soon, though, as the Sun and Mars are in the most confidential part of your chart.

"
4 july 2016,leo,"With the new moon in the most secluded part of your chart, you will be able to come to grips with a number of situations that have been on your mind as of late. Neptune has been stirring up your deepest emotions, but with Mercury’s help you’ll be able to pinpoint the best way to resolve them. The next six months can be life changing, but first you need to take out the “trash”.

"
5 july 2017,leo,"Mercury enters your sign today, the perfect aspect for expressing yourself both verbally or in writing. But with other planets in your house of confidentiality you would be wise to keep certain pieces of information to yourself. Not everyone needs to know every bloody detail of your life–or where you’re heading!

"
5 july 2016,leo,"Your intuition should be off the charts today, due to a trine between Mercury and Neptune. The watery planet is known also as the artist’s muse, so if you’re looking for artistic and business inspiration, it’s there. Reach out and grab it.

"
6 july 2017,leo,"You may have strong opinions about things but if you’re wise you will keep them to yourself over the next 48 hours. Not everyone can handle the unvarnished truth, nor are they as practical as you are these days. Let them figure things out for themselves. In the meantime, carry on.

"
6 july 2016,leo,"As Mercury glides past the Sun in the most metaphysical part of your chart, your intuitive abilities will be right on point. Venus is also in this part of the sky, shedding light on which direction you need to head in and easing the way. With other planets in your family, love and money sectors all forming positive angles, you can make excellent progress in these areas. Between now and the time that the Sun enters Leo, you will be withdrawing and working in solitude….but that’s the best way to go right now.

"
7 july 2017,leo,"You may need to readjust your relationship with a friend or acquaintance, Leo. Now that easy going Venus is in your house of camaraderie, you’ll have no trouble making new connections. But does everyone deserve to be in the inner circle? Pick and choose the people who rate that status.

"
7 july 2016,leo,"Red alert: difficult day ahead in the cosmos. Keep your lips zipped at the office, and tread carefully with professors if you’re a student. The people you work with could be into power plays, but you are actually in a strong position. Your intuition is in fine form, helping you outsmart the boss wannabes and the tyrants. Things bounce back tomorrow, so just let it ride.

"
8 july 2017,leo,"Nothing is going to get in the way of the fierce lion. Tonight’s full moon in your most energetic, let’s-get-things-done sector paves the way for a torrent of activity that’s about to take place. Losing weight, toning up, cleaning the house, catching up on work assignments–heck, you’re even going to get ahead of them! But this is a good thing. August promises to be one of the most amazing months ever, so you need to be primed and ready to go.

"
8 july 2016,leo,"If you’ve been holding back, fearing to boldly move ahead when it comes to earning more (I believe they call it “fear of success”), it’s time to take your foot off the brake…and floor it! A beneficial aspect between Mercury, in your highly intuitive twelfth house, and profitable Jupiter encourages you to get moving.

"
9 july 2017,leo,"Your intuition can serve you well these days, Leo, considering that the Sun and Mars are both in the house of the subconscious mind. But you need to put in the grunt work if you want to use it to your fullest advantage. That means that you need to take the time to meditate, journal your dreams, and basically slow down to become more mindful.

"
9 july 2016,leo,"Still waters run deep, and with so many planets in your perceptive twelfth house right now, your intuition is your best guide. A secret meeting between the Moon and hit-it-big Jupiter in your income sector bodes well for making progress in this part of your life. Don’t pooh-pooh any ideas that come your way as being outlandish or impossible. Security is the name of the game.

"
10 july 2017,leo,"Today’s a tense one for all signs of the zodiac with a showdown between two powerful orbs: the Sun and Pluto. People could be in quite a bossy or critical mood. But whereas other signs have the green light to blast the offending party into the stratosphere, you need to lay low, like the good little predatory lion that you are. Say little, observe a lot and wait for the right time to take action.

"
10 july 2016,leo,"No sign of the zodiac has more going on behind the scenes than you, Leo! But this is a good thing. Your birthday season is fast approaching, and it’s time to figure out which opportunities to pounce on. Two amazing aspects today will help you get a handle on both residential/family matters and your career. The cosmos is determined to see that you feel secure in these areas, so consider what needs to be done quietly on your part to bring more balance into your life.

"
11 july 2017,leo,"Your chart indicates that there are people around you who simply can’t be trusted for whatever reason. However, not everyone is an enemy and today you could talk with someone who actually has your own best interests at heart! Pay attention, because some interesting connections could be made this week.

"
11 july 2016,leo,"Be careful with what you say or put in writing, as a tense square between demonstrative Mercury and maverick Uranus means that there could be unexpected repercussions, no matter how innocent your words are. Uranus is in your house of the media and dissemination, indicating that your remarks could reach more people than you intended. Even if you are the target of someone else’s vitriol don’t respond in kind.

"
12 july 2017,leo,"Get your inner shaman on! With the Moon in the groovy, vibey eighth house it’s time to seek wisdom from other realms. Learn how to meditate. Study mindfulness. Create a vision board and focus on it. Sometimes ya just gottta stop using the left side of your brain.

"
12 july 2016,leo,"Meow! Sultry Venus sashays into Leo today, ramping up your charisma and sex appeal. The next three weeks are perfect for jazzing up your image, whether it’s your physique, hair style, wardrobe or makeup. Set those appointments now with the stylist, personal trainer or even the plastic surgeon (Botox, fillers, tummy tucks—these are all in Venus’s area of influence). What a lot of people don’t know is that this golden girl also governs profits, so you’re also in an awesome position to negotiate, push your agenda forward and brainstorm when it comes to business. Gotta love it. And the Sun isn’t even in Leo yet!

"
13 july 2017,leo,"With logical Mercury in your sign, you may be creating to-do lists and strategies. Which is fine–but maybe you need to think a bit more creatively! A Moon-Neptune conjunction helps you in the inspiration department, so don’t just stick to the old tried-and-true.

"
13 july 2016,leo,"Got a message that you’d like to spread to the world, Leo? Then you’re in luck! Motivating Mercury zips into your sign today, helping you walk the walk and talk the talk. Whether it’s a video going viral, a book proposal you’re pitching, a declaration of love you’d like to make or a deal you want to close, you’ve now got the chops to pull it off. With Venus in the same house you have one heck of a tag team.

"
14 july 2017,leo,"It’s not your birthday season quite yet, but energetic little Mercury is already in your sign and is anxious to get the party started. Since this planet is known for its ability to stimulate the mind and all forms of self-expression, your brain should be crackling with good ideas. When Mars rolls into Leo on the 20th, you can swing into action.

"
14 july 2016,leo,"You may be tempted to take a chance on something, but conservative voices in your head are holding you back. Innovative Uranus is sparking your desire to live a little bit bolder, which is a good thing as it will help you grow as an individual. However, make sure that your plans are built on a solid foundation before you charge ahead. A measured risk, one that takes security into consideration, can  be accomplished.

"
15 july 2017,leo,"This can be a wonderfully cathartic day if you allow it to be. Of course, if holding on to negative dramas is what floats your boat, then go ahead and wallow in your misery. But if you want to release the negative kaka and live a life of greater contentment, a cleansing Moon-Uranus aspect will soothe your soul.

"
15 july 2016,leo,"Passion! We have it for so many things– a lover, our kids, a hobby, traveling, our pets, and feeling fit. Today’s Moon-Saturn convo tells you to pursue your passions with abandon. But how many times do we start something we love and not follow though? (Guilty as charged!) Saturn will provide you with the discipline to make it happen.

"
16 july 2017,leo,"Not everyone around you shares your enthusiasm or opinions, and they may not be happy to see you make progress. But they’re in for a rude awakening as you’re moving away from malcontents and into a life that’s going to be a heck of a lot more exciting. Once Mars rolls into Leo next Thursday, the brakes come off.

"
16 july 2016,leo,"Got a presentation to give in the near future? A job interview, a date with a sizzling new prospect or a written piece that showcases your talents? Hell, it doesn’t matter if you’re just going out for drinks with your pals! A smokin’ hot Mercury/Venus hookup makes you the person to pay attention to, Leo. Work it!

"
17 july 2017,leo,"Someone in your personal or business life could be acting in a way that doesn’t sit well with you, but is it really smart to tell them off? This is one of those times when sucking it up may actually be the best strategy. This doesn’t mean that you’re weak; on the contrary, it indicates that you have the wisdom to pick your battles.

"
17 july 2016,leo,"It’s back to school soon for the kids, but the cosmos is encouraging all Leos to do the same. Whether you take a class just for fun or to increase your earning power, today’s aspects indicate that a surprising benefit could arise from attending classes. It’s also a good day to apply for a scholarship or grant. The ancients understood that we need to expand our minds, and they never stopped learning. Neither should you!

"
18 july 2017,leo,"Attention single lions: this is one of the best days of the month to meet someone new, and it could be from an online hunt, a matchmaking pal, or attending a get together. Attached Leos should start spending more time with other couples or join some kind of a group, like a charitable organization, to expand your social contacts.

"
18 july 2016,leo,"It’s not what you do, it’s how  you do it that counts this week. A powerful Moon-Pluto meetup urges you to study your routines, schedules and protocols, both at home and in business. Pluto’s job is to pinpoint the weaknesses in a situation so that they can be fixed. With tomorrow’s full moon in this part of your chart, start evaluating how you can become more productive.

"
19 july 2017,leo,"Buzzy little Mercury is already in your sign, lighting up your mind with new possibilities for the birthday year ahead. Today the messenger planet joins forces with stable Saturn, the planet of long term success. The message here? The projects you initiate now and the people you meet could play a big, happy role in  your future.

"
19 july 2016,leo,"You wouldn’t set off on a journey without a map and a plan, would you? Not to mention having all of the supplies you need on hand. That’s the message of the full moon in Capricorn. This lunation falls in the most detail-oriented part of your chart, telling you to ponder, make lists, and strategize before you bolt forward. Whether it’s planning your wedding, organizing the house or restructuring the work flow at the office, take some time to think things through first. A tense Uranus angle warns that if you just focus on the big picture without considering the grunt work, your project could get derailed.

"
20 july 2017,leo,"OK, let’s get this party started! Your birthday party, that is. The Sun isn’t in your sign yet, but megawatt Mars just rolled in and he’s ready to kick some butt.

Nothing, and I mean nothing,  is going to stop you.

"
20 july 2016,leo,"Taking good care of yourself can take many forms, from eating right to exercising to hanging out with uplifting people. A sweet angle between luxe Venus and Saturn, planet of simplicity, tells you to practice more indulgent self-care by adding beauty into your daily life. Fresh flowers, a trip to the museum, a massage–think about ways you can appreciate life more visually and sensually, without breaking the bank!

"
21 july 2017,leo,"A steady theme running through the month of July is that you may be trying to get too much done in too little a period of time. You need to figure out a way to finesse this, Leo. With the Sun about to enter your sign tomorrow you could become even more  motivated and anxious. Don’t forget to have some fun while you’re planning world domination.

"
21 july 2016,leo,"Lucky Jupiter is stationed in your income sector, its first visit to this part of your chart in 13 years. It will be moving on in early September, so now’s the time to plant seeds that will grow into money trees. A positive Jupiter-Moon aspect encourages you to consider a business collaboration as a means to furthering your ambitions. This could also mean retaining an expert, such as a booking agent or stylist. Consider your options.

"
22 july 2017,leo,"Yeah, baby–it’s showtime! The Sun is now in Leo, kicking off your official birthday season. Break out the bubbly and pour yourself a mimosa, as this year will be off the charts compared to years past. That’s because there will be a new moon in your sign on Sunday, then another  one on August 21st–a solar eclipse no less! It doesn’t get any better than this.

"
22 july 2016,leo,"Happy birthday, Leo! Your annual new year begins today as the mighty Sun barrels into your sign. The year ahead will see big changes, as many lions will find new love, go back to school, and become an authority in their field. It will be all about self-promotion, not a problem for your feisty sign! Once Jupiter enters Libra in early September, it’s time to showcase your talents on a much bigger stage than the past.

"
23 july 2017,leo,"Look at you, lucky lion! Today the cosmos delivers the first of TWO new moons in your sign (the next one is on 8-21). Take some time today to create a wish list of things you’d like to manifest in the year ahead. One warning, however: keep it real. Maverick Uranus could spur you to shoot for too many goodies in an unrealistic amount of time.

"
23 july 2016,leo,"A simmering, sizzling Moon-Neptune connection stirs up your passion not only for another, but for life in general! With the Sun now in your sign, it’s time to think about not only the goals you want to achieve, but also the kinds of emotions  you want to experience in the year ahead. Joy? Gratitude? Anticipation? The choice is yours.

"
24 july 2017,leo,"Thanks to so much recent planetary activity in your sign, your brain is coming up with exciting and visionary plans for the future. However, a harsh Venus-Saturn aspect indicates that people around you (friends and lovers, most likely) aren’t supportive. Looks like jealousy is the issue here, so disregard any snarkiness and carry on.

"
24 july 2016,leo,"How high can you fly? A spectacular Moon-Sun trine sets your thoughts about the future soaring. With practical Saturn in your house of creativity, you can come up with visionary ideas that are still grounded in logic.

"
25 july 2017,leo,"Things just keep on getting better for you, lion!

This may be one of the first areas to focus on, with September being the month for really making things happen financially.

"

This is a smart move considering that your personal new year has begun, and the more organized you are the easier it will be to achieve goals and have free time for fun. But the Moon in the most footloose part of your chart today rebels against drudgery and routine. That’s OK. Enjoy yourself, because you’ll be back on track tomorrow.

"
26 july 2017,leo,"Faster than a speeding locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound! No, it’s not Superman…it’s Leo! Damn, you’re motivated. With the Sun and Mars meeting together in your sign, you are experiencing cosmic energy that’s a true game changer. World domination begins right now.

"
26 july 2016,leo,"The kinds of assignments you handle, as well as the quality of the people you interact with at work, is under review by the cosmos. Fortunately, power broker Pluto is on the case, trying to improve your lot. Today a harmonious tine between Pluto and the Moon could fire you up to raise the bar.

"
27 july 2017,leo,"The path ahead may have seemed unclear, all tangled up with branches and fallen trees that you needed to hack your way through to see clearly. Well, get out your machete, Leo, because the Moon is shining its light on the obstacles that need to be removed. After that it’s full speed ahead.

"
27 july 2016,leo,"Some good news could come your way today about a change that will take you to a higher level in just about any area of your life. That maverick Uranus is shaking things up, challenging the status quo. Doing things the same old way just doesn’t cut it anymore.

An auspicious Moon-Jupiter conjunction helps you strategize, whether you’re trying to land Mr. Right or a new job. Your ability to brainstorm is second to none these days, so seek the advice of others, but remain the final decision maker.

"
28 july 2016,leo,"You’re anxious to get started with new projects, Leo! Not surprising, considering the cluster of planets in your sign, setting your brain abuzz with plans for the future. With the Moon in your house of authority, your confidence level is rising too. But not everyone around you shares your views or agrees with your plans. It may be best to keep them to yourself as you charge forward.

"
29 july 2017,leo,"Someone may be way too opinionated for your taste, but that doesn’t mean that you need to engage in their chatter. You have a lot of good things coming your way, which they may sense. Let ’em stew while you go about your day.

"
29 july 2016,leo,"Back to the future! Tech-savvy, look-ahead Uranus goes retrograde for the next five months in your entrepreneurial ninth house. Which means–slow down, look for weaknesses in a plan, learn new skills and don’t expect overnight success in a product or service launch. All Leos, regardless of employment status, need to focus more on details and not take on too many activities or assignments. Long-distance love affair? Think twice before jumping in!

"
30 july 2017,leo,"You know what you want…so what are you waiting for? Spunky Uranus lights a fire under you to grab that brass ring. Besides, more opportunities will be coming your way that you haven’t even considered. It’s your birthday season, babe–take a great big piece of the cake!

"
30 july 2016,leo,"Got some bright ideas that could put more cash in your wallet? Then vamanos, Leo, because commerce-driven Mercury just entered your income sector.

And with rational, long-term Saturn in your creativity sector, your ideas could be fresh, new to the marketplace and quite profitable.

"
31 july 2017,leo,"Now that provocative Venus is in the most secluded part of your chart, you might back away from being showy. Does a beautiful flower fight to get the bees to come its way? Hell no. It just sits there looking gorgeous, waiting for the cosmos to send it admirers. And so should you.

"
31 july 2016,leo,"Someone’s been working way too hard lately, and their paws are dragging as they try to slink forward as a fierce feline. Sound familiar, Leo? It’s time to recharge your batteries, and that doesn’t mean a beer and Netflix. Get thee to the gym, pool, or tennis court and get the blood and oxygen flowing in that body of yours.

1 august 2017,leo,"A meditative mood might strike today, perfect for ruminating about what you’d like to create in the year ahead. With a solar eclipse coming in your sign on the 21st, you’re in an awesome spot to wipe the slate clean and start afresh. With the Moon in the most innovative part of your chart, don’t rule out what appear to be random thoughts that pop into your head.

"
1 august 2016,leo,"It’s your birthday season and the cosmos is opening up its goody bag for you, lion! Two hot steamin’ trines today will help you toss aside preconceived notions about what you’re capable of, and then take some calculated risks. You’ll be willing to take a chance in love as well as career. A trip to Katmandu? No problem. After you patent that invention that’s been rolling around in your head. Go for it.

"
2 august 2017,leo,"No one loves love–or life!– more than a Leo, and today is a wonderful time to do more of what puts a smile on your face: spending time with your kids or amour, relaxing with a hobby, getting your blood racing with a sport or doing something creative. This isn’t just for today, though; this should become a new, happy habit.

"
2 august 2016,leo,"Pour the Prosecco! The cosmos delivers its annual birthday gift to you: a new moon in Leo. This is like a gift card that you can use to go after any goal or dream of your choosing. You’ll have to put in the effort to be sure, but if you do so your life can look a heck of a lot different by next February. Oh, and by the way–it just so happens that Mars enters your house of romance today too. Shake that shaggy mane and pounce.

"
3 august 2017,leo,"You’re flying high this month, Leo, especially with an upcoming solar eclipse in your sign on the 21st. You may feel as though the sky is the limit, and it is. But planet of genius, Uranus, retrogrades today for five months, which means that you have to avoid biting off more than you can chew. Focus on a few key goals and develop momentum with them first.

"
3 august 2016,leo,"Motivation and a zest for living start to gain momentum, thanks to the new moon in Leo yesterday. Over the next two weeks you will feel more creative and in control. Looking for recognition? Then get your name, resume, talents and hot little body out there for the world to see!

"
4 august 2017,leo,"You’re not the type that likes to be told that they can’t do something—RAWR!!—but planetary aspects indicate that you need to you need to slow your roll. It appears that you’re being overly optimistic about what can be done in a certain amount of time, and if you don’t take a time out things might start to fall apart. Rome wasn’t built in a day, Leo.

"
4 august 2016,leo,"Now that the Moon is in Virgo and Venus heads there tomorrow, it’s time to develop some sound routines and strategies that will help you earn more. A solar eclipse takes place on September 1st in your earnings sector; be ready for it.

"
5 august 2017,leo,"Are you bringing sexy back? Where the hell did it go? A spunky Neptune-Sun aspect tells you to get in touch with your steamy, sultry side. Don’t be so focused on chasing after your dreams that you forget how to live a luscious life.

"
5 august 2016,leo,"Oh, yeah. The planet of profits goes into your income sector today. Between  now and the 29th you have an amazing opportunity to show your worth to the boss, clients, a prospective employer, an agent or the marketplace. But nothing will happen if you sit on your duff. Work it! With Venus by your side, people will pay attention.

"
6 august 2017,leo,"They say that habits make the man (or the woman), and from your chart it appears that yours could use an upgrade. No matter how impatient you may currently be to get something done or achieve a particular status, it’s not going to happen unless you start handling time management and your routines better.

"
6 august 2016,leo,"Just how willing are you to put yourself out there? Are you willing to take a risk in love? Quit the day job to pursue an entrepreneurial passion? Push your creative talents to an even higher level, one that you didn’t even think was possible? These kinds of questions will be on your mind today as two planets in security-conscious Virgo square off against two others in adventurous Sagittarius. When Saturn goes direct on the 13th the path will become clear.

"
7 august 2017,leo,"Should I stay or should I go? The lunar eclipse in Aquarius poses that question to you. Whether it’s a romantic relationship or a business related one, it’s time to make an executive decision. Chances are you’ll be darn interested in looking out for #1 with assertive Mars close to the Sun.

"
7 august 2016,leo,"Hold on to the plastic, Leo, and be discerning when it comes to spending and investing your hard-earned money. A demanding Mercury-Neptune opposition could tempt you to spend money that you don’t have, or to invest in a questionable venture. Right now it’s all about building a strong financial base. Focus on earning more and investing it wisely.

"
8 august 2017,leo,"Uranus is known as the planet of genius and innovation, and today this bad boy is acting up–in a good way! It can change the way you view a key relationship, encourage you to form an alliance with someone, or plant an idea in your head that can take you far. The key right now is that other people can and will play a big part in your future happiness and success.

"
8 august 2016,leo,"It’s critical to remain objective and rational when it comes to money matters and your big financial goals. Spontaneous Uranus is sparking your desire to go after something sensational–a business startup, quitting the day job, patenting an invention, going global–but other planets are warning you to keep it real. This doesn’t mean that your ideas won’t work. Rather, you need to pay more attention to the process: daily routines, sticking to a budget, maintaining a level of security.

"
9 august 2017,leo,"With the Sun in your sign and an upcoming eclipse, this is one of the most transformative times for you ever. Today chief inspector Pluto asks you to analyze your methods of getting things done, otherwise known as efficiency! You’d be wise to adjust any habits that are lacking, as things are about to take off in a big way.

"
9 august 2016,leo,"Resourcefulness is one of your fine qualities, Leo, but lately you may be coming up short when it comes to assets. Assets like time, money, credit, the right contacts, maybe even support from the people closest to you. As a result, you may have been playing it safe when taking a look at future plans. But today’s Moon-Venus connection bodes well for strengthening your asset base.

"
10 august 2017,leo,"Your self image and the manner in which you express yourself are key, and the planets are telling you to buff them up. This isn’t just about a new haircut or clothes; it also includes an attitude alignment. Which ought to be easy to pull off, thank you very much, considering that gentle Venus is in your house of the subconscious mind, working her magic.

"
10 august 2016,leo,"New opportunities to boost your income are in today’s stars, as planet of negotiation Mercury forms a perfect angle with transformative Pluto. It could be a raise, new job, new client or an additional earnings stream. Mercury will be actively helping you increase your bottom line, but in order to reap the rewards you have to get your name out there.

"
11 august 2017,leo,"Express yourself! A fabulous Sun-Jupiter link enables you to get your ideas and thoughts out there to the people who count. Between now and October 10th you should be brainstorming, strategizing and promoting yourself aggressively.

"
11 august 2016,leo,"A smart plan for making more money could use a little tweaking, and inspiration could come upon you suddenly. With the Moon swinging past Mars and Saturn, taking a more creative approach is the best way to go. You have a lot of talent, but with Saturn in retrograde motion, you haven’t tapped in to your creativity as best as you could. That’s going to change this weekend when Saturn goes direct.

"
12 august 2017,leo,"Don’t count your chickens before they hatch! Mercury retrogrades in your earnings sector, slowing down job offers, promotions and signing new clients. Entrepreneurs will find that new strategies will take more time than expected. No problem, however. With a solar eclipse arriving in Leo on the 21st, a few delays aren’t going to stop the mighty lion.

"
12 august 2016,leo,"Get ready to rumble! The past five months may have been fraught with delays or snags, especially in matters of the heart and business. That’s because mighty Saturn has been retrograde, forcing you to reevaluate your romantic prospects as well as your skill level at work. But the retrospection is about to pay off–Saturn resumes direct motion manana.

"
13 august 2017,leo,"It’s no secret that you’re the celestial favorite these days, with the Sun and Mars in your sign and an upcoming eclipse too. But the good news just keeps on getting better for you as the mighty Sun trines Saturn today, a superb aspect that adds a dash of romance and creativity to your life. Set long term plans in motion in all areas of your life. Just make sure that they include as much fun and new experiences as possible!

"
13 august 2016,leo,"Get in touch with your artistic mojo, Leo! It’s an off-the-charts day for creative projects. Saturn goes direct in your house of talent, enabling you to impress others with your ideas and skills. With the Moon, Sun and Uranus forming a perfect triangle in the sky, you could end up seeing your work hitting the big time in the months ahead. Just don’t expect the money to come pouring in right away, as Jupiter’s in a tough spot. Slow and steady will win this race.

"
14 august 2017,leo,"Great day for some soul searching when it comes to your career and other key goals. Your intuition and creativity will be high, so use them to help distill your plethora of ideas into a few winners. The best time to launch them? At the solar eclipse in Leo next Monday.

"
14 august 2016,leo,"You’re ready to break out of an old self-image, Leo, and today inspirational Uranus gives you the kick in the pants you need.  With Mars and Saturn in your house of the arts, it’s time to start living a more authentic, creative lifestyle. Pluto, the great transformer, will help you rebuild a happening new existence from the ground up.

"
15 august 2017,leo,"Snap out of it! Stop feeling sorry for yourself or being resentful about what other people have done. Pluto in your uber-practical sixth house tells you to focus on your own life. Enough of the hand wringing and self-indulgent psychoanalysis.

"
15 august 2016,leo,"It’s an amazing day for launching a new endeavor! First, the fiery Sun in your sign forms a trine (the best angle possible) with stimulating Uranus, the planet of genius. Then the Moon shakes hands with Pluto in your work and productivity sector, saying, “Yeah….we can do this!” By the way, Pluto doesn’t like doing things the same old way, and neither does Uranus. It’s time for a new MO.

"
16 august 2017,leo,"Your motivation rises today as aggressive Mars is in a feisty mood! It’s time to rewrite your goals and plans, and that includes love and money. This is no time to be sentimental. Keep it real and go for it.

"
16 august 2016,leo,"Thinking about going global–or viral? If gaining more press, market share, or contracts is on your agenda, then you’re in luck. The authoritative Sun in your sign is shaking hands in a serious meeting with innovative Uranus in your house of broad horizons. With the full moon later this week falling in your house of partnerships, you may end up in a profitable collaboration with an interested party.

"
17 august 2017,leo,"Both your intuition and logical mind are strong these days, which is usually  a wonderful thing—until they start sending conflicting messages. The issue at hand is that you have many options ahead of you, various paths to take, and you can see the advantages and drawbacks of both. The air will clear within the next 48 hours, so wait a bit before making decisions.

"
17 august 2016,leo,"It’s time to feng shui your work routines, Leo, whether they’re at the office or at home. A super Venus-Pluto trine in your efficiency area urges you to try new tricks and hacks that will simplify and streamline your daily life, and then turn these into habits. The upside? Profitable Venus is in your earnings sector, promising that if you do the grunt work you’ll end up with more money in your pocket.

"
18 august 2017,leo,"The theater lights are dimmed, the curtains haven’t risen yet…but you can sense the bustle behind them as the show is getting ready to begin. Monday’s solar eclipse is almost here and today is perfect for some last minute strategizing. With the passionate Moon conjuncting Venus, consider what you’d really like to manifest in the year ahead–then get ready for showtime!

"
18 august 2016,leo,"A sparkling full moon in Aquarius sets the stage for you to enter into an adventurous new phase when it comes to collaborating with others. Whether it’s in love or business, your aspects for meeting someone who will want a partnership with you are excellent. Will this mean parting company with someone else? Possibly, especially if financial problems were cutting into the alliance. Strong relationships, however, will carry on, and with more optimism and spontaneity.

"
19 august 2017,leo,"To thine own self be true! Don’t let the (unsolicited) opinions of others dissuade you from pursuing your heart’s desire. Furthermore, don’t allow your own fears to hold you back either. You’re the mighty lion, and nothing is going to get in your way.

"
19 august 2016,leo,"Just how hard do you want to work? 60 hours a week? 80? Please! A Moon-Neptune conjunction tells you to work smarter, not harder. Whereas a four-hour workweek may be the stuff of fantasy (I’m talking to you, Tim Ferriss) it would be wise to consider ways to get better financial results without putting in so much time. Lions need to luxuriate, you know.

"
20 august 2016,leo,"Telling a Leo to not splurge on a luxury item is like telling a bird not to fly…..but so it is! Lock up the credit cards for the next week, as a number of celestial orbs in your finance sector might make you feel more flush than you really are. That being said, when the Sun enters Virgo on Monday your income could get a big boost in September. Just make sure to earn it before you start spending it.

"
21 august 2016,leo,"You may feel anxious to get moving with plans, especially if they’re on the fun and creative side. But the planets are telling you that first you need to develop a ritual or protocol and stick with it in order to succeed. You may feel that doing so will curtail your artistic expression or make fun seem too structures, but if you don’t have a blueprint things will fall apart.

"
22 august 2016,leo,"You’re entering into one of the most profitable years in over a decade, Leo, and the key will be promotion: how you market and sell your skills, ideas, and reputation. Today the mighty Sun powers into Virgo, your second house of earnings, where it will stay for a month. Blessing this action is a positive meeting between generous Jupiter and intelligent Mercury.This is no time to hide your light under a bushel. Got ideas? Work ’em.

"
23 august 2016,leo,"I think I can, I think I can! The freight train known as Leo keeps chugging forward, and today’s aspects provide a dose of inspiration to keep that momentum going. A strong Moon-Pluto-Venus triangle in the heavens recommends that you change the way you go about doing things, especially in your career. The profits are out there; however, a more creative or innovative approach is needed to snag them.

"
24 august 2016,leo,"Stop, start, stop, start! Has that been a recurring theme in your life lately? You may especially be feeling this in matters of the heart. Love can be heating up, but your rational mind tells you to slow down. You want to spend quality time with the kids, but then a responsibility pulls you away. You delve into a hobby or creative project, only to neglect it for awhile. You’re not a disorganized mess: Mars and Saturn are sending mixed signals. But Saturn’s gonna win this battle, so slow down and start to appreciate life more.

"
25 august 2016,leo,"Leos are known as the most artistic of all the signs, and they can tap into their creative mojo whether they work as an accountant, stay-at-home Mom, or a graphic designer. Yesterday’s awesome Mars-Saturn meet up was designed to help you mine the depths of that talent. However, an opposition from the Moon today could create doubts in your mind, as a friend or colleague might question how you go about things. The doubts could also be coming from your subconscious mind (“will this really work out?”). Yes it will, and next week’s solar eclipse will point that out to you.

"
26 august 2016,leo,"Despite the fact that energetic Mars and Saturn are working hard to take your ideas to the next level, they’re still not ready for prime time. That’s OK, though–disciplined, logical Saturn will be by your side for yet another year. It’s Mars that’s making you antsy to see results, and today the fiery planet gets a bucket of Neptunian water dumped on him. More time, thought and perhaps even more money is needed to turn them into reality.

"
27 august 2016,leo,"Ready to live the luxe life? Of course you are–you’re a Leo! And you’re going to love today’s Jupiter-Venus conjunction, a powerful meeting in the heavens in which these two will be discussing your lifestyle. You’ve got to make it to spend it, and as Venus and Jupiter are both in your house of income–and both  govern profits–you’re in a sweet spot. However, don’t run off to Neiman Marcus just yet: Mercury will be retrograding here next week, urging you to be budget-conscious. Focus on making the green stuff for now.

"
28 august 2016,leo,"It’s an interesting day in which you may have one of those “Eureka!” moments, Leo. You may suddenly find that your mind is rejecting a certain philosophy, idea or even a spiritual principle that you had held dear. This could be due to a sparkling trine between the Moon and Chiron, the wounded healer. It’s time to release old, outworn ideas that are no longer serving you.

"
29 august 2016,leo,"With Venus moving into your house of brainstorming, negotiating and discussions, you’ll be more than ready to communicate with others, whether it’s family, a lover or a business contact. But Mercury retrogrades tomorrow in your income sector, indicating that you’ll need to be budget-conscious in any project you decide to undertake. Make sure that everyone in your world is on the same page about finances.

"
30 august 2016,leo,"Your personal and business finances will be under the microscope in the weeks and months ahead, but this is a good  thing. A positive solar eclipse on Thursday could usher in a new job with a pay raise, clients with deep pockets or even a change in occupation. But with Mercury going retrograde today in your income sector, you need to get real about spending and saving the green stuff. Set aside time to analyze where the money goes every month–and brainstorm ways to earn more.

"
31 august 2016,leo,"Despite Mercury having gone retrograde in your earnings sector, asking that you budget and be careful with expenditures, your spirit isn’t sinking. Au contraire–a zesty Uranus-Moon meetup is encouraging you to dream up ways to earn more! And this is the smart way to finesse Mercury retrograde, as this is the planet of intelligence and strategizing. Think long-term and consider all of your new options.

"
1 september 2016,leo,"Ka-ching! Love that sound, and it’s a sound you’ll be hearing more of in the months ahead. A smokin’ solar eclipse in your income sector helps you ratchet up your earnings, which could mean a new job or a raise is coming your way. But the cosmos isn’t the cavalry riding in to drop dinero in your lap. You have to make some effort, so if your wallet is not as hefty as you’d like, begin brainstorming. If that means starting a business on the side or taking an existing company to a much higher level, so be it. Green lights ahead.

"
2 september 2016,leo,"Feel like you’re in a financial or romantic rut? It’s possible with a T-square in the heavens, pulling at you from all directions. Part of the problem seems to stem from a need to have security, whether it’s staying in a job, career, or relationship that isn’t satisfying. Or perhaps you simply can’t find the time to balance your need for down time, romance and intimacy. However, a happy meeting between Jupiter and Mercury indicates that you’ll find the enjoyment you want–and the security you crave.

"
3 september 2016,leo,"Yes, it’s a Saturday. Yes, it’s a holiday weekend in the US. And yes, you’re a fun-loving Leo looking to enjoy some down time. But that’s not stopping the Moon from swinging past your productive house of making mo’ money. Don’t worry, no one is telling you to actually do some work and go into the office. Instead, pay attention to any bright ideas that stream into that feline head of yours. They could end up being money in the bank.

"
4 september 2016,leo,"Finding both the time and money to enjoy life may be a source of frustration these days, Leo. Vacations, dinners out, concert tickets–they’re all calling your name, not to mention chic new clothes and some spiffy home furnishings. Conquer the desire to spend, as a pending Saturn-Neptune square warns you to be more conservative with your cash. This doesn’t mean that you’re not going to have any fun, however. With Jupiter just about to enter your highly social third house, you’ll be living it up–just closer to home.

"
5 september 2016,leo,"Within days, Leo, you’re going to be a walking idea factory. Of all the signs of the zodiac, lions will be the ones with the most brainstorms and creative juices flowing. And this isn’t just a two-day or three-week gig: hell, no, we’re talking about the next year.  And while some of these sparks of genius can end up being quite profitable, today’s aspects warn that you need to give them time to manifest.

"
6 september 2016,leo,"Looking to increase your net worth? Then today is a good time to brainstorm. Passive investments, such as rental real estate, or running a business on the side while you work a day job are highly favored by the cosmos. With the Moon making a fabulous aspect to inspirational Neptune, you should be able to come up with some sizzling ideas. As the week progresses you can start to flesh them out.

"
7 september 2016,leo,"Yeah, baby! It’s time for a certain lion to strut their stuff (which is never a stretch for your regal sign!). A potent Sun-Pluto trine helps put you in the driver’s seat when it comes to your career. Pluto has ben retrograding in the part of your chart that governs what you do for a living and how you go about getting things done. No doubt you’ve been introspective and have developed some new ideas and habits. Well, they’re about to pay off. Step out of the shadows and into the light. Take on the mantle of a leader.

"
8 september 2016,leo,"Creative Leos will reach new heights of creativity today as the Moon helps you dig deep into your well of talent. La Luna connects with both ambitious Mars and disciplined Saturn in your house of artistic ability. With profitable Venus in a happy angle, you should be considering how to promote your skills and portfolio. It’s also a super day for romance: meeting a new person in the neighborhood, or making plans with your amour to get out there and enjoy life.

"
9 september 2016,leo,"For the past year, abundant Jupiter graced your income sector. If you used this time wisely, planting seeds for a higher paying job or a booming business, now’s the time to nurture the seedlings. This is your best year in over a decade for self-promotion, writing, teaching, hitting the lecture circuit, crushing it on social media, and landing interviews. It can also be a highly social time in which you’re mingling with friends and neighbors, enjoying the company of fresh new faces. Any problems in the past with siblings or cousins should be laid to rest. And short-distance travel is favored, so start planning some fun three-day weekends.

"
10 september 2016,leo,"Oy vey. Leo, what’s going on in that head of yours? Neptune is stirring up some pretty deep thoughts and emotions, making them rise to the surface of your consciousness. You want to process them and let them go. But then stern Saturn gets on your case for ruminating and maybe even wallowing in self-pity or drama. Fortunately Jupiter just went into your house of intelligence and communication yesterday. You’ll be able to figure this out, don’t worry.

"
11 september 2016,leo,"As much as you may feel like socializing, power broker Pluto is telling you to get down to business. You have an exciting year ahead now that Jupiter is in your third house of mingling and communication, but before you start hobnobbing you need to get caught up on some grunt work at home or at the office.

"
12 september 2016,leo,"Intelligent Mercury is hell bent on bringing you mo’ money, and it could be coming your way in the form of a new job, raise, or a client with deep pockets. But the messenger planet is retrograde, which means that you need to be careful while discussing dinero with others. Mars is in a difficult spot, possibly creating intense negotiations. Artists and creatives: don’t undersell your work!

"
13 september 2016,leo,"The luxe life may beckon, but honey, the bills gotta be paid. Mars is blazing a path through the part of your chart that governs the fun stuff in life. However, today it squares the authoritative Sun in your savings sector. Does this mean that you’ll be spending the next six months eating ramen noodles at home? Hell, no. But it does  mean that you need to exert more discipline when it comes to your finances.

"
14 september 2016,leo,"Attention Leo artists and creatives: consider partnering with someone, or hiring an expert to represent your talents. Sweet angles between the Moon, Uranus and Mars are perfect for lining up a posse of experts that can take your talents to a higher level. The same holds true for employees and business owners, who should be taking a more innovative approach to success.

"
15 september 2016,leo,"With the passionate Moon hooking up with amorous Neptune today in your house of intimacy and bonding, chances are your thoughts are turning to love and what you need from a partner. Whether you’re single or attached it’s important to consider these factors, as there is a lot of planetary activity in your romance sector. Lusty Mars winks at Uranus, telling you to live a sexier, more adventurous life. Don’t settle for Mr. or Ms. Dull & Boring.

"
16 september 2016,leo,"Love and money, always a potent mix. Today a lunar eclipse in Pisces highlights both areas of your life, specifically intimacy, deep emotions and your sex life, as well as the strength of your financial portfolio. A business venture that you’ve been working on may finally bear fruit, as all of the right pieces come together. Investors may want to loan you money, loans could be paid back, or a windfall could arrive from a non-business source. You could also make a decision rather suddenly about your love life, such as ending a less than stellar relationship, or popping the question to the Right One. As one door closes, another one opens for you both in romance and financial opportunity.

"
17 september 2016,leo,"Adventure is calling your name, Leo! A dazzling Mars-Uranus trine could spark a spontaneous desire within to do something that’s outside your usual routine or repertoire: dating a different type, trying out a new exotic cuisine, planning a vacation on the road less traveled, or trying your hand at a hobby or sport. Creatives, this day is perfect for pushing your talents to the next level, so head to the studio and hunker down.

"
18 september 2016,leo,"It’s time to bust out of an old groove that is getting tired, maybe even boring. You may have been so focused on getting things done around the house and at the office that you’ve forgotten something important: there’s a great big world out there, and it’s calling your name! This realization could hit you quite suddenly–and strongly. Pay attention.

"
19 september 2016,leo,"Stay local or go global? Operate at a snails’s pace, or go viral? That’s the question the stars have for you today, Leo, as Venus and Uranus square off in the heavens. Uranus can light a fire under our tushies pretty quickly, so don’t be surprised if you get a sudden urge to expand way  past your current circumstances.

"
20 september 2016,leo,"Mercury has been retrograde in your income sector for the past few weeks, encouraging you to rethink your earning, saving and spending strategies. Today it forms a magnificent trine with transformative Pluto. One thing’s for certain: you should be considering new ways to get ahead financially. This trine will reoccur on Friday, so spend some time this week formulating a plan.

"
22 september 2016,leo,"The lion roars! Start warming up your vocal cords, Leo. And your fingers and brain. The authoritative Sun enters Libra today, which is your third house of communication. Writing, negotiating, drawing, lecturing, teaching, blogging, chatting—all of these activities are highly favored over the next year thanks to Jupiter’s presence in this part of your chart. But now with the Sun there too, you’ll be unstoppable.

"
23 september 2016,leo,"A tug of war between intuition and logic may occur as your higher mind picks up information from the cosmos. The problem is that your logical mind may be in happy-happy land, whereas your intuition is highly focused. If you sense something is off, it probably is.

"
24 september 2016,leo,"You’re in a good spot to earn more as a profitable Mercury-Pluto trine occurs in the heavens. You could land a new client, develop a fresh product line, add a needed service to your company or impress the boss with your efficiency. But the Moon may find you doubting yourself. Don’t go there—you’re on the right track!

"
25 september 2016,leo,"A lion can quietly sit by the sidelines for hours, even days, surveying the scene while they’re waiting to pounce. With the Moon now in your sign and a magnificent Sun-Jupiter conjunction tomorrow, get ready to spring into action. Your days of not being heard are over as lines of communication open up wide. Writing, blogging, pitching ideas, engaging in sweet talk, socializing and even teaching could be a big part of your life in the year ahead.

"
26 september 2016,leo,"Time to roar, Leo! A smokin’ hot aspect between the Sun and Jupiter puts you in the spotlight, especially when it comes to self-expression. There has never been a better time to communicate your ideas, whether that means via the arts or writing, lecturing, socializing or marketing. With the Moon in your sign forming a trine with Saturn, whatever you initiate now will have long-term  impact. Shameless self-promotion is the name of the game!

"
27 september 2017,leo,"Watch out world. Leos are on the loose, and you’ll be able to see them burning up a path on the jogging trail or the treadmill at the gym. Mars has just entered their sixth house of fitness and vitality for the first time in two years. Oh, and you might want to get out of their way at the office or in the kitchen too, as they’re hell-bent on becoming more efficient. They might find that others are getting annoyed with their can-do attitude, but that’s too bad. Somebody’s gotta lead the pack.

"
28 september 2016,leo,"You can make a lot of progress when it comes to setting productive new habits in place, things that will make life simpler while perhaps even adding to your wealth. Creating a budget is well aspected, along with planning for retirement or another big expense such as buying a house or paying for your kids’ college educations. But Neptune is in a tense angle, indicating that you need to be realistic in your planning.

"
29 september 2016,leo,"Don’t let your emotions get the better of you, especially when it comes to money matters or concerns about your personal security or self-esteem. Someone may spout an opinion that gets under your skin, and you may not see it coming. Count to ten and breathe as this too shall pass.

"
30 september 2016,leo,"Excellent day to speak your mind! The emotional Moon meets up with optimistic Jupiter, encouraging you to express yourself, which can also include the graphic arts, writing, or just plain socializing. However, be mindful when it comes to dealing with your kids or a lover as a tough Saturn-Neptune angle may be clouding your vision. They may need boundaries—today’s a good day to set them.

"
1 october 2016,leo,"Don’t hold back! The next six months to a year is the most auspicious time in over a decade to self-promote, courtesy of a new moon today in your chatty third house. Write, blog, prospect, advertise, teach, lecture, draw, use social media, create a demo tape, polish up your portfolio or resume—do whatever it takes to get your message out there. With Venus and Neptune forming a harmonious trine, your prospects for financial success are awesome. Home-based businesses should do well also. But it won’t be all about working your connections: this can be a highly social time too in which you can mix and mingle with a lot of fun people.

"
2 october 2016,leo,"Your brain should be buzzing with ideas and projects you want to pursue, but where should you start? Venus in your comfort sector may find you questioning just how far you want to go with certain initiatives. Quitting the day job, for example, to run off and sell pina coladas on an island beach somewhere might sound enticing, but a lion needs a den and three solid meals a day.  Give yourself time to make the right decisions.

"
3 october 2016,leo,"You may be feeling restless, even edgy, as the Moon is in your house of emotions and Jupiter has your brain going at warp speed. If there was ever a week (or month) to start meditating or beginning a practice of mindfulness, Leo, this is it! The cosmos is blessing you with brainstorms–the problem is that you can only process so much at a time. Sl-o-o-o-w down.

"
4 october 2016,leo,"Honey, if you have a bright idea, now’s the time to buckle down and get working on it. With red-hot Mars in your house of efficiency and the illuminating Sun in your self-expression sector, strike while the iron is hot! The Sun makes a terrific angle to disciplined Saturn too, indicating that whatever you work on can be successful far into the future. The key is to schedule time every day to work on whatever it is your brain is cooking up.

"
5 october 2016,leo,"Terrific day to take control of your work flow and get caught up on errands. If you’re overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tasks that need to be done, here’s a great book to read: Getting Things Done by David Allen. He has a simple yet super-productive technique for getting on top of your tasks so that you are in control rather than the tasks controlling you. You’ll need to be organized, as planetary activity in your self-expression zone is hurling ideas at you left and right.

"
6 october 2016,leo,"Here’s the good news: your energy level is rising, especially when it comes to self-expression—talking, writing, drawing, socializing, teaching. And so is your creativity! But a tough angle today between Mars and Jupiter indicates that you may be pushing too hard, running the risk of revealing too much or trying to complete something in too hurried a fashion. The key between now and the middle of October is to pace yourself and pay attention to the finer points.

"
7 october 2016,leo,"Ah, the downside of being a regal creature—dealing with the jealousy from the “common people”. Hope you’re used to dealing with envy, because you could be at the receiving end of it over the next two weeks! The problem? The Sun and lucky Jupiter have been active in your house of self-expression, making you the guy or gal with the bright ideas, the killer portfolio, and the sauciest catwalk. Today Mercury joins them, which will quicken your thoughts, making you even more productive and charismatic. The haters will primarily come from the office or the gym, so watch out for power plays and childish behavior coming from their direction.

"
8 october 2016,leo,"Oh, yeah. The weekend is here and it’s time for….partying? Binge watching some Netflix? Shopping for swag? Sorry, Leo. How about balancing your checkbook, organizing your closets and coming up with a game plan for getting your work done. The crazy thing is, you are actually going to be in the mood for this, courtesy of Neptune inspiring you to become more efficient and streamlined. Cut loose next weekend with the Aries full moon.

"
9 october 2016,leo,"Leos are acting more like Virgos these days–getting organized, streamlining their work flow at home and the office, balancing their checkbooks and maybe even hitting the gym. A super Moon-Mars-Pluto aspect is responsible for this, and it’s necessary. You need to get your “house” in order before you tackle the next big plan, otherwise you’ll be dealing with a house of cards.

"
10 october 2016,leo,"With the Moon in a helpful angle from your partnership zone, this is a good day to communicate your thoughts and needs to someone close. It’s possible that someone may contact you about entering into a business alliance, something to consider. Your brain is popping with so many ideas that you may not be able to execute all of them by yourself.

"
11 october 2016,leo,"Hey there, Einstein! Leos are looking like the smartest thing on two legs with a powerful meeting between sharp-as-a-tack Mercury and optimistic, abundant Jupiter. It doesn’t get much better than this for brainstorming. With red hot Mars in your efficiency zone in good angle to inspirational Neptune, today’s cosmic energy is amazing for dreaming and then doing.

"
12 october 2016,leo,"It’s time for the fearless lion to go into one of your famous “naps”. You know, the kind when it looks like you’re lounging but you’re really planning your next strike. Silence is the word o’ the day—and the next week, actually—as tense angles could create pushback from people at the office, whether they’re colleagues or clients. No matter how diplomatic you  may be, it won’t matter, so the best bet is to just chill and wait for this to pass.

"
13 october 2016,leo,"Steer clear of divas and trolls over the next few days as chatty Mercury squares off against Mars. The less you say the better, as people around you may be looking for a drama or a fight. You have so much energy these days encouraging you to move ahead, whether it’s with a diet and exercise regimen or a work assignment. Channel your drive into these activities and ignore the malcontents.

"
14 october 2016,leo,"Leos like the good life and today a happy meeting between Mercury and Saturn will help you live more creatively: enjoying delicious cuisine, fine wines, shopping for a sassier wardrobe and filling your lair with plush decor. But you also need to carve out time for hobbies and other pursuits that make your heart sing, easy to do with Saturn by your side. Make this a non-negotiable.

"
15 october 2016,leo,"A project that you’re working on may need to go back to the drawing board for revisions, Leo. Whether it’s your thesis, redecorating the bedroom, a marketing plan or a vacation agenda, the planets are erratic today. A decision maker may make demands; a service provider could slack or refuse to do their share of the work; a sudden change of venues or activities could occur; or a colleague is acting like the Queen Bee. Don’t sweat it, because in the long run the things you’re putting effort into will pay off handsomely.

"
16 october 2016,leo,"Big plans get a burst of wind beneath their wings with tonight’s full moon in Aries! Of all the signs, Leo, you are an idea factory these days, and something you’ve been working on could come to a happy conclusion or turning point this week. But keep your eyes open for a sudden switcheroo or obstacle that may seem to come from nowhere, as erratic Uranus may throw a monkey wrench into the works. It’s essential to have everything you present to the world to be in tiptop shape: presentations, papers, contracts, social media posts, e-mails and even your spoken words. No, Mercury’s not retrograde, but the Sun is demanding perfection before your plans really take off.

"
17 october 2016,leo,"Inspiration could strike big time when it comes to one of your most closely held dreams or goals. The moon forms a spectacular trine with metamorphic Pluto, so don’t be surprised if you begin to rethink or tweak an ambition. This is especially true when it comes to your health, diet and fitness, as well as work assignments you’ve been handling. A megawatt Mars-Pluto conjunction on Wednesday in this part of the chart will add rocket boosters to your plans.

"
18 october 2016,leo,"A match made in the heavens: luxe Venus enters your house of fashion, beauty, dining out, having fun…and did I mention romance? No one knows how to live the good life better than a Leo, so you should be in your element over the next three weeks. Take some time away from being a brainiac to nurture your sensual, creative side.

"
19 october 2016,leo,"It’s not what you know—it’s how you apply  what you know that counts, Leo. And that message will be drilled into your brain today as the two most dynamic planets in the solar system, Pluto and Mars, hold a serious conversation in the heavens. It’s time to stop dreaming and put an end to incessant strategizing, and to take action on whatever it is that’s important to you: losing weight, buying a house, organizing your files, getting fit and healthy, prospecting more, finding new love, or starting a business. These two orbs are going to light a major fire under your tush to get going, and in the process they may bring some powerful decision makers your way.

"
20 october 2016,leo,"Someone could express a opinion today that goes totally against your ideas or a plan that you’re working on. The opposition may even catch you off guard, and you may be tempted to protect your “territory”. But why bother? You can’t expect everyone to go along with your genius ideas. Keep doing what you’re doing: you’re on the right track.

"
21 october 2016,leo,"Your intuition could be working overtime today with the vibey Moon in the house of the subconscious mind. Likewise, La Luna could raise your sensitivity level to the moronic behavior and remarks of others. Sometimes ya just gotta rise above it, and today’s that kind of a day. But you might also realize that you can remain above it forever  if you choose.

"
22 october 2016,leo,"It’s time to feather the nest! The Sun is now in your domestic sector, opening up a four-week window of time in which you can remodel, redecorate and organize your closets and drawers. Thinking of moving? This is the perfect time to look for a new place, especially with a new moon occurring in this part of the sky on the 30th. This sector also governs your overall sense of comfort and security, not surprising since we tend to feel nourished and safe in our home base. If there are any negative emotions or dramas that have been holding you back from enjoying life, it’s time to release them, especially if they are related to past and present family issues.

"
23 october 2016,leo,"You’re going to need to open up the lines of communication early this week, especially when it comes to financial and romantic matters. A helpful Jupiter-Neptune aspect today is designed to help clear the air and get down to the nitty gritty; no LaLa Land thinking allowed! Otherwise you could fall prey to someone’s BS on Tuesday. Keep it real.

"
24 october 2016,leo,"How confident and secure are you? Well, with Mercury entering the part of the sky that governs these states of mind, you ought to be feeling a heck of a lot better. It doesn’t matter if you chat with a friend, schedule a session with a therapist or just work things out by taking a long walk alone in the woods, your ability to find greater comfort and serenity is now heightened.

"
25 october 2016,leo,"The say that flattery will get you everywhere, but is that really true? Smart people can see through insincere compliments. Make sure that you’re not dishing out any happy horses*** today, and if you’re at the receiving end of it, the best choice of action is to ignore it. This may be more difficult, however, if it’s coming from a lover or admirer. Stay on your toes.

"
26 october 2016,leo,"Perfect day to talk things over with a lover or child with a healing Jupiter-Venus aspect. With lucky and optimistic Jupiter in your communication sector, you should be able to make points, uncover problems and make progress without a lot of drama, threats and screaming. It’s also a promising day for creatives to self-promote and develop their talents even further. All Leos should consider taking a class just for the fun of it and spending more time on hobbies.

"
27 october 2016,leo,"Does a family or housing issue have your knickers in a twist? Then get it resolved, pronto. Today’s the day to do so with a magnificent Sun-Mercury conjunction. Talk to a parent, sibling or in-law about a drama that has gone on for far too long; call a real estate agent about listing your house or finding a new place to rent; work things out with a roommate; hire a contractor to fix the leaky roof. You may also find that this is a good time to become more emotionally centered, especially when it comes to releasing past issues that may stem from your childhood. Let ‘em go.

"
28 october 2016,leo,"A silver tongue! That’s what you possess today, Leo. This is the perfect time to express yourself with a meeting of the passionate Moon and generous Jupiter. With Mars forming a terrific angle with Chiron, the wounded healer, you can make amends with a lover or patch up differences with a child. But it’s also an auspicious time to ask someone out on a date, drum up venture capital or present your art portfolio to an agent or gallery.

"
29 october 2016,leo,"How realistic are you being about love these days, Leo? And for that matter, about kids too—conceiving them, raising them and dealing with their problems? Today’s a “tough love” day in the heavens as nurturing Venus meets up with disciplinarian Saturn. You may need to set boundaries with a lover or with children as it seems that things may be getting out of hand. Creative lions, you may need to scale back plans a bit and become more focused on logging in the hours to perfect your craft before showcasing your talent.

"
30 october 2016,leo,"A lion needs a lush lair, and the planets are telling you to create a home environment that makes you want to purr. Today’s new moon in Scorpio suggests that it’s time for some redecorating, organizing and cleaning. Yes, the holidays are coming, but you should be doing this for yourself–not just for company! With both Neptune and Venus in such a prominent position your ideas could be wildly creative, not to mention sultry.

"
31 october 2016,leo,"Sometimes you need to “play well with others”, other times you just gotta do your own thing. And this week it’s more about following your passions and creative impulses rather than waiting for everyone else to jump on board your train. You may be annoyed that others aren’t doing their part or are slacking in some way. All the more reason to focus on your own game plan and to work it.

"
1 november 2016,leo,"The fog clears in emotional matters, things that may have been troubling you for some time. The Sun is in your house of contentment, urging you to release negativity so that you can enjoy a much happier future. Today it forms a glorious trine with vibey Neptune. The watery planet, interestingly enough, is in the house that governs the “deep waters” of your emotions, stirring them up to the surface of your psyche so that they can be released. Good riddance!

"
2 november 2016,leo,"Even though the planets are pushing you to take care of matters at home and at the office, you need some time for you. And that doesn’t mean sitting in front of the TV with a beer. No, we’re talking about mind-expanding, enriching cultural experiences that will give you a renewed appreciation for the world we live in. The passionate Moon will stir you up today to feed your head with beauty.

"
3 november 2016,leo,"Sometimes you can get away with flying by the seat of your pants, but the cosmos warns that now is not one of those times! Instead, you need to be organized, have a ritual, know what work has to be done in advance, keep your home running smoothly and stay on top of errands. Not sexy, I know, but with a full moon coming on the 14th in your house of ambition and success, you need to be prepared.

"
4 november 2016,leo,"Too much work and not enough play could make for one cranky little lion. The planets are encouraging you to take some much-needed down time—NOW— before Venus enters your work sector in a week’s time. You could be quite busy wrapping up a work project due to the full moon on your career coming on the 14th, but for heaven’s sake, find some time to play.

"
5 november 2016,leo,"Leos are known as the most creative sign of the zodiac and today your artistic mojo should rise (to quote Jim Morrison). Whether you’re a backyard gardener, weekend woodworker or a Grammy winning musician, it’s time to let those creative juices flow. If you’ve been ignoring hobbies or even the sports you used to enjoy, spontaneous Uranus will give you a swift kick in the pants to get back into the groove.

"
6 november 2016,leo,"It’s time to start living la vida loca, Leo! A spunky Uranus-Venus trine urges you to spread those wings and fly–literally. Book a vacation to a far off destination where you can shake your shaggy mane. If travel is out of the question right now, then shake up your weekend routine of dinner and a movie, say, and switch to a wild night of dancing in a club. Life is too short to be in a rut. Vamanos.

"
7 november 2016,leo,"With Mars just about ready to leave your sixth house of efficiency and getting things done, it would be wise to wrap up unfinished projects. Then create a list of the things you want to accomplish over the next few months, pour yourself a glass of wine or tea, and put your feet up. You’ve worked hard in recent weeks, Leo–time to chill. When Mercury enters your house of frisky fun on Saturday it’s time to start making plans that simply involve relaxing.

"
8 november 2016,leo,"Partnerships will be heating up over the next five weeks, be they romantic or business-related. But be discerning about whom you connect with, as there could be a number of people who’ll want to be by your side. Don’t feel pressured to enter into a business alliance or amorous relationship if you’re not ready. That being said, joining forces with someone else could be the key to your future happiness and success. Perform due diligence and move ahead with your eyes wide open.

"
9 november 2016,leo,"Sweet love! One of the best times ever for finding romance, raising happy children or developing a deeper bond with an amour is here, right now. Lusty Mars just entered your house of serious commitment for the first time since 2014, so start your engines! Then on Saturday talkative Mercury zips into your house of romance, which is actually a different spot than the partnership zone. The next few weeks are super for holding heartfelt conversations with loved ones. Singles—get the word out there that you’re available!

"
10 november 2016,leo,"With a full moon approaching in the house of your goals and ambitions, no doubt you’re ruminating over which areas of your life need the most improvement. A Moon-Neptune conjunction today shines its light on your financial affairs, specifically the bedrock of your portfolio: savings, retirement accounts and debts. Fortunately for you, they form a helpful aspect with the Sun, and they’re determined to create a strong foundation. Start here first.

"
11 november 2016,leo,"Business deals could heat up as people around you start to notice your creativity and brilliant ideas. The same holds true for romance, as you’re not looking like a shy little wall flower these days (but then do you ever?). Consider new offers and options that are put in front of you, then get ready to take action after the 14th. A full moon occurs in your house of ambition, giving you the impetus to move ahead on some of them. Just be wary of doing too much of the “heavy lifting” in alliances, a possibility under current planetary influences.

12 november 2016,leo,"It can’t be all work all the time, Leo. The full moon on Monday does  fall in your house of career, and you may be putting the finishing touches on a big project. But Mercury’s entry into your frisky, romantic fifth house indicates that you need some play time too. No lover on the scene? Then take care of yourself by setting aside a few hours every week just for hobbies, reading a good book or (yessssss) a shopping expedition.

"
13 november 2016,leo,"BIG career changes are on the horizon, as tomorrow’s full moon in your house of ambition is a super moon–the biggest full moon since 1948! Your creative juices should be flowing, thanks to Mercury now in your house of genius and inspiration. But don’t try to push things through too quickly, as others around you may put up resistance. You also need to take care of small details for the overall plans to fall together.

"
14 november 2016,leo,"Expect new doors to bust open, Leo! A potent super moon (the most intense since 1948) occurs in your house of ambition today. It’s an amazing time to wrap up important projects you’ve been working on, and to get moving on even more exciting plans.If one of those “plans” happens to include finding love or progressing with an existing relationship, you’re in luck as a happy Mars-Mercury aspect is in your favor. However, keep details about work-related goals to yourself, as co-workers might want to put the kabosh on your ideas.

"
15 november 2016,leo,"Yesterday’s powerful super moon in your ambition zone should kick off a new phase of achievement, so don’t be surprised if you attract people into your orbit who sense your can-do attitude. Today is excellent for talking with potential partners who are interested in forging an alliance. But make sure that you retain control of projects, especially the financial end. You don’t need hangers-on who intend to do little work but want to cash in on your success.

"
16 november 2016,leo,"Pay close attention to the word and actions of friends and family members, as your relationship with some of them may need tweaking. This could mean pulling away, getting closer or just ignoring petty dramas. With so many planets pushing you forward with your ambitions (not to mention bringing intense love your way), you can’t let their opinions get in your way. Listen, consider what they say, then do your own thing.

"
17 november 2016,leo,"If money has been tight lately, you could start feeling the pinch. But the good news is that the Moon in the most intuitive part of your chart is forming a superb aspect with intelligent Mercury in your creativity zone. There are  solutions out there to your dilemma—and you will be able to dream up innovative ways to earn more.

"
18 november 2016,leo,"The calculating lion is looking a little starry eyed today, and that could be a problem! That’s because you  could end up being the prey of a love interest who’s hot but unreliable or a smooth-talking salesman. Protect your heart and your wallet with a heavy dose of common sense. When Neptune goes direct on Saturday your vision will become much clearer, and you’ll be able to accurately assess people for what they are.

"
19 november 2016,leo,"Leos love luxury, and nothing is going to chap their regal asses than not having enough dinero to splurge. The good news is that Neptune goes direct today in your house of finances, helping to alleviate financial insecurity. Does this mean that you should run out and spend your hard earned money on swag? No—actually, the planets recommend spending conservatively. But with the Sun just about to enter the most fun-loving part of your chart, that may be hard to do!

"
20 november 2016,leo,"The Moon in your sign this weekend is firing up your desire to live a more beautiful, cultured lifestyle, Leo. Whether you’re lusting over gorgeous items to decorate your home, drooling over the recipes in your favorite food blog, or trawling the travel sites in vacation planning mode, your motivation to live the good life is certainly increasing. When the Sun enters Sagittarius tomorrow, you’ll stop swooning and start doing!

"
21 november 2016,leo,"“I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.” So said Albert Einstein, but I beg to differ–the dude was talented. And so are you, Leo! Now that the Sun is in the most expressive part of your chart, dig down into that wellspring of know-how and let your skills shine. If they happen to be a little rusty, then polish them up with a class, webinar or good instructional book. With lucky and profitable Jupiter in your learning sector for the first time in 13 years, this is a superb time to learn from the masters.

"
22 november 2016,leo,"What is it like to be oozing charm from every pore, Leo? It’s a tough situation to be in (LOL), but you can handle it. Now that the Sun is in your dynamic house of talent, showmanship, creativity and fun, all eyes will be on you. Make sure to give your audience the performance they’re hoping to see. Think of fellow Leo Jackie Kennedy and you’ll get the idea.

"
23 november 2016,leo,"Romance is in the air as energetic Mercury teams up with long term Saturn. Singles, get the word out that you’re on the market, as a new flame could be right around the corner. This hottie could turn into a serious candidate for marriage, so unless you’re looking for a quick hookup, be prepared for the real deal. Attached Leos could reignite romantic sparks, planning juicier date nights, conceiving a baby, or getting engaged. A new moon next week will open up a new window of opportunity for all lions to be happier in love.

"
24 november 2016,leo,"Getting from point A to point B may not be as easy as you think, Leo! You may have an interesting plan or project you’d like to tackle, but you can’t just think big—you need to take the appropriate steps to get there. This isn’t a sprint, by the way, it will be a marathon. But when a number of planets move into Capricorn in December, you’ll be able to figure out precisely what needs to be done.

"
25 november 2016,leo,"You’re on a roll, Leo! The planets are lighting a fire under your tush to get things done, and I’m not just referring to holiday shopping or home decorating. With so many planets in your house of creativity and raw talent, you want to show the world what you’ve got, which will require some effort and planning. Today is perfect for figuring out your next step.

"
26 november 2016,leo,"Be bold! It’s time to unleash your creativity, whether you’re decorating your place, developing a business plan or working on a piece of art. Inspirational Uranus sparks your talent as it trines intelligent Mercury, creating the perfect storm of smarts plus artistic mojo. And you ain’t seen nuthin’ yet. Just wait until next Tuesday’s new moon in the most expressive part of your chart.

"
27 november 2016,leo,"A healthy lion is a sexy lion, and today the cosmos urges you to get in better physical shape, for no other reason than to dazzle your public. But you know deep down that a solid foundation of health and vitality is crucial for your peace of mind. The ancient Taoists viewed physical fitness as the gateway to better mental health and they were right!

"
28 november 2016,leo,"You have some pretty interesting ideas these days, things you’d like to pursue. But are there enough hours in the day to get around to all of them? What about the help you’d need from other people? Thoughts and concerns may be rolling around in your head, causing doubts. But the new moon tomorrow will help you come up with creative solutions. Get ready to be inspired.

"
29 november 2016,leo,"If you can dream it you can do it! That’s the message behind today’s new moon in the most creative part of your chart. The good news is that Saturn is in an excellent angle, supporting your efforts. The ringed planet governs discipline, solid habits and rational long-term planning, so you’ll have plenty of smarts along with expressive mojo. If you need to take a class or webinar in order to polish your skills, sign up now as Jupiter encourages education. Just make sure you stay as focused on the details as you do on the bigger picture.

"
30 november 2016,leo,"Whip out the BS meter! Someone may be blowing smoke in your direction, hoping to win favor with you. You have something they want, but it’s not your responsibility to give it to them. With the energetic Sun in the most expressive part of your chart, you’re being doused with creativity and charisma. Is it any surprise, therefore, that others want to bask in your light?

"
1 december 2016,leo,"The recent new moon in your house of skill and talent should be shaking you out of a rut and into a place where you’re ready to show off your chops to the rest of the world. Well, today a magnificent meeting between Mars and Jupiter will enable you to reach out to others who can make some big dreams happen. Don’t hold back, expecting the world to beat a path to your door! You need to put yourself out there, and that includes romantically as well. Serious partnerships, both in business and romance, can be established now.

"
2 december 2016,leo,"OK Disney fans, remember the song, “Whistle While You Work” from Snow White?  It’s all about getting the chores out of the way, a helpful thing to do before you start singing, “Someday my prince will come.” Well, that pretty much sums up your situation, Leo. Industrious Mercury enters your house of efficiency today, urging you to get your act together both at home and the office. Considering that love planet Venus is about to enter your commitment sector next week, you don’t want to be burdened by annoying tasks when you could be flirting with the Prince. Or Princess.

"
3 december 2016,leo,"Partnerships can be cemented in the weeks ahead as a number of planetary aspects are clearing the path for connecting with others. This includes romantic alliances as well as business ones, so expect to be busy! Today serious Saturn is determined to find you only the strongest kind of love, something with long term potential. Creative projects are also well favored. If you’re looking for an agent, writing partner or someone to promote your talent, reach out to as many people as possible between now and the 13th.

"
4 december 2016,leo,"Sometimes a languid lion needs to be jolted out of a restful nap and start feeling lively! The cosmos will be stirring up your creative juices as well as your love life this week. A passionate Mars-Moon-Jupiter aspect today encourages you to reach out to others and connect. Ask someone out on a date, plan a racy date night with your amour, talk to fellow artists or sign up for a class that will polish up your talent. Let the bears hibernate, Leo, not you!

"
5 december 2016,leo,"You’re about to enter one of the most romantic periods you’ve experienced in a long time, Leo! Love planet Venus enters your commitment sector on Wednesday, joining her (lusty) cosmic partner, Mars. And with serious Saturn trying to bring you stable, long-term amour, you’re in good shape to enjoy the finest, truest kind of love.

"
6 december 2016,leo,"The planets are lining up to take your skills and talents to a much bigger stage, and positive events may occur that you’re not expecting. That means that you need to be ready—with an updated resume, a 15-second elevator pitch, a brag book or portfolio, stylish hair, the right clothes and a decent manicure (that includes you gents!). You only get one chance to make a good impression, and while your skills will speak for themselves, your image needs to be spotless too.

"
7 december 2016,leo,"Love is in the air, Leo! Romance planet Venus glides into your commitment sector today, bringing new love to singles and a more sizzling sense of amour to coupled up lions. The key is to make sure that your partner shares the same values and goals as you, which could become an issue at the time of next Tuesday’s full moon. Don’t try to force your opinions on someone in the hopes that they’ll agree. Keep the lines of communication open.

"
8 december 2016,leo,"Partnerships, be they business or romantic, seem to be in a state of flux right now. It’s important to consider the ideas and opinions of the people around you, as they can be on to something good—and they may also be right! But you’re also in an excellent position to provide input, as the mighty Sun is in your house of creativity, self-expression and talent. Caring is sharing—trite but true.

"
9 december 2016,leo,"It’s time to get serious about your craft, Leo, whatever that means to you: your parenting skills, various responsibilities at the day job, study habits or honing your artistic talent. Like right now. A megawatt meeting on Saturday between the Sun and Saturn will push you to create new habits and routines. The good news? They’ll stick, and you’ll see fabulous results between now and October of 2017.

"
10 december 2016,leo,"Reality check! If you’ve been on a fluffy pink cloud somewhere, idolizing a love interest or pretending that a romantic partner doesn’t have the very obvious flaws that everyone else can see, wake up. A serious meeting today between the Sun and Saturn tells you to get real. This also includes your kids. It’s time for tough love, not enabling.

"
11 december 2016,leo,"If you’re truly fortunate, you’re in a line of work that you love. That’s not the case for most people, and the proud lion can be found dragging its tail if it has to skulk off to a soul sucking job. An optimistic Moon-Pluto aspect, however, is super for getting passionate about your career. Pluto is the planet of transformation, so if you’re not happy with what you do, it’s time for a reboot. Yesterday’s intense Sun-Saturn meeting fell in your house of skills and talent, which means that it’s time to get serious about yours. Don’t settle.

"
12 december 2016,leo,"You might stumble upon some pretty interesting ideas today, Leo, thanks to a meet up between the Sun in the most creative part of your chart and spontaneous Uranus. They could deal with love, they could deal with money, but overall these brainstorms are all about living a much bigger life–one without so many boundaries. You could simply hear a phrase that hits you the right way, or pick up a book that helps you see things in a different light. Seize the moment.

"
13 december 2016,leo,"Wrap up tech projects, marketing launches, team efforts and entrepreneurial activities. The full moon in your house of big ideas and plans urges closing these out so that you can move on to the next step. That being said, don’t be too quick to get things out in the public eye as it seems that they’re not quite ready for prime time. Spend the next few weeks finishing up the details, then get ready to launch after December 29th. That day a new moon occurs in your house of work assignments, and Uranus finally goes direct in the publicity sector.

"
14 december 2016,leo,"With abundant Jupiter in your house of self-expression, you may feel relaxed enough to speak what’s on your mind. But today you might want to keep your thoughts and words to yourself as a tough aspect indicates that you could be facing opposition. Your ideas and opinions have merit and they’re far-sighted, but others may not be able to see the forest for the trees. Wait until after the 21st when the Sun enters Capricorn to start hashing things out with your colleagues, friends, lover and family.

"
15 december 2016,leo,"The proud lion doesn’t do well when confronted with boundaries, preferring unlimited horizons. However, there is such a thing as reality, and it produces circumstances that you have to live with—at least for now. With spunky Uranus acting up in your house of limitlessness, you may feel those boundaries more intensely today and want to rebel against them. Save your energy. Don’t fight; figure out a way to go after your passions within your existing situation.

"
17 december 2016,leo,"Don’t be surprised if you decide to pick up a new hobby or sport this weekend, or return to one that gave you joy in the past. With the Moon in Leo and the Sun in the most creative part of your chart, it’s time to cut loose and put some energy into things you’re passionate about. You could become so inspired that you decide to join a group of like minded people who are involved in the same activity.

"
18 december 2016,leo,"If you haven’t been seeing eye to eye with someone, make an attempt to work things out today. It may not be easy with a Moon-Mars opposition but you’ll be glad later on this week that you did. That’s because the red planet moves into one of the most emotional parts of your chart tomorrow, and issues about money and sharing responsibilities could erupt in a big way.

"
19 december 2016,leo,"You’re in an excellent position to make headway with big financial plans, as long as you remember that the devil is in the details. Today high energy Mars rolls into your house of big money, opening up a seven-week period which could prove to be quite lucrative. But Mercury retrogrades in your house of strategizing and streamlining. The message? Solid habits and systems are required to see more of the green stuff. Flying by the seat of your pants isn’t going to cut it.

"
20 december 2016,leo,"Feeling frisky? You should be, Leo, now that lusty Mars is in your house of libido and intimacy for the first time in two years! However, duty calls as the Sun will be entering your get-it-done sector tomorrow. Yes, this is the least sexy part of your chart, the place where we clean out closets, organize the sock drawer and catch up on unfinished work projects. Sigh. If it’s of any consolation to you it’s also the house of getting fit and toned, so take that feline energy and pour it into developing a hot, buff body!

"
21 december 2016,leo,"Ready to make some major progress with your finances? You should be, now that Mars is in your house of financial security. The cosmos is planning on keeping you busy with assignments that will raise your profile and skill level, but first you have to take care of unfinished projects. Not only that, it appears that the methods and habits you use for accomplishing your goals need an overhaul, so get going now. The slow week between Christmas and New Year’s is actually a great time for getting your act together. The faster you do that, the faster you’ll see more money.

"
22 december 2016,leo,"You may feel completely entitled to express your opinion, but the cosmos warns to hold back on your thoughts and words. There could be a surprising amount of resistance from certain quarters that you may not expect, so the smart lion keeps their cards close to their vest. This vibe continues to grow up to the 26th, so remain on your guard.

"
23 december 2016,leo,"Releasing negative emotions and past dramas can actually be a rather painless activity today as the Moon forms a helpful trine with energetic Mars in two of the most cathartic parts of your chart. This may be just the perfect holiday gift from the cosmos, Leo! Why carry bad mojo with you into 2017? When Uranus goes direct on the 29th you might start delving into ancient or foreign philosophies that will open your mind to a new way of thinking.

"
24 december 2016,leo,"Taking your talent and skills to a whole new level is what the cosmos has in mind for you, Leo. And today’s happy Uranus-Saturn trine may push you into developing that talent in 2017. Practice makes perfect, so start scheduling time for it. Whether you need to take a class, get advice from a mentor, watch some videos or listen to podcasts, make this a serious goal for the new year ahead.

"
25 december 2016,leo,"Going it alone doesn’t appear to be in the cards–or should I say the cosmos?–right now. With generous Venus in your house of partnerships sending lucky beans to three other planets, the stage is being set for creating or developing alliances. Whether they’re for love, business or just for fun, these connections will become a big part of your life in the months to come.

"
26 december 2016,leo,"Two of the most liberating planets, Uranus and Jupiter, form a rare (once very 14 years) aspect in the heavens. The problem is that they are opposing each other, creating a conundrum: which path to take? In your case, they oppose each other in houses that deal with lofty goals, entrepreneurship and personal growth. You may need to cut certain options from your life in order to pursue something that’s important to you. Clarity will arrive by the weekend.

"
27 december 2016,leo,"The planets are sparking your mind with inspiration, so take this gift from the cosmos and run with it. Mars is currently in the house of making big money and the sun is illuminating the path ahead. Tomorrow brings even more bright ideas, so keep a pad of paper nearby and write them down. The new moon on Thursday is the time to initiate them.

"
28 december 2016,leo,"While other signs may think that you spend your time lounging and luxuriating, what they don’t realize is that the chill lion can actually be quite the work horse. You just make it look so easy, that’s why! And you’re going to need to put that hard work ethic to good use once tomorrow’s new moon arrives. Rest up today and recharge your batteries, Leo. The next six months are going to be very  busy.

"
29 december 2016,leo,"Take your foot off the brakes, Leo. Today’s new moon in Capricorn kicks open doors that may have been shut in the past. Since it falls in your house of streamlining and organizing you’re going to be gung ho about pulling your life together so that it runs like a Swiss clock. It’s not enough to have big ideas: you need a workable plan and intense attention to details in order to pull them off. You’ll be able to make a lot of progress even before 2017 begins!

"
30 december 2016,leo,"Hey everyone, I’ve got a secret to spill! Leos are planning world domination next year. While you’re getting ready to party like it’s 2017, the lion is quietly stalking around, strategizing and getting inspired by Neptune. This is the sign that’s going to surprise everyone in the months ahead, because they’re starting early on their New Year’s resolutions. But they’re way too proud (and stealthy) to admit it!

"
31 december 2016,leo,"Talk flirty to me! It’s a sweet time to let someone know how you feel as the planets are ratcheting up your charisma and chattiness factor. Single? Then you have the cosmos’s permission to be an unabashed flirt, so get out there and work it. To your surprise, a lover with long term potential may appear on the horizon, so this is no time to hide your light under a bushel.

"
1 january 2017,virgo,"Pick a partner! A sizzling connection today between Neptune and Mars tells you that two heads are better than one this year, Virgo. This holds true for business, volunteer work, love, working out and simply enjoying life. 2017 is not the year of playing the lone wolf. Singles stand a good chance of meeting someone new within the next few weeks and attached Virgos can reboot their romance.

"
2 january 2017,virgo,"Building a stronger financial portfolio is the order of the day now that erratic Uranus has resumed direct motion in your fiscal sector. And it’s quite possible that teaming up with someone else is the best way to go about earning more! If you’re in a creative line of work, bringing in someone with a fresh perspective could be profitable. But regardless of your field, sharing responsibilities with someone sharp could add to your bottom line.

"
3 january 2017,virgo,"2017 is off to a fast start, Virgo, especially where matters of the heart are involved. Amorous Neptune and dynamic Mars were in your house of commitment on the 1st and now lovely Venus joins them for a four week stay. Singles, this is one of your best times all year to meet someone new: don’t waste a moment of it! Coupled Virgos should find it easier to communicate and to make plans for the future. Not happy in love? Then this coming weekend could be a game changer in which someone new appears on the horizon.

"
4 january 2017,virgo,"Family ties will count in the week ahead as Mercury back spins into your domestic sector. Now’s the time to work out any lingering issues that carried over from 2016: squabbles with relatives, roommates or landlords, custody battles over children, or making the decision to move (or not). Fortunately Venus just entered your commitment sector, so at least your partner should be on board with your concerns and decisions. If they’re not there yet, know that Venus will be here until February 3rd, so you have a month to come to good terms.

"
6 january 2017,virgo,"If a romantic or family drama has been going on for far too long, with feelings getting hurt (primarily yours), now’s the time to voice your opinions. Will everyone appreciate it? Probably not. Will they change right away? Doubtful. But you have a life to live, and with next week’s full moon occurring in your house of big plans, you’re not going to be in the mood for dealing with kaka. Speak your mind. If you don’t, you’ll be at the mercy of others, not a place you want to be in the months ahead.

"
7 january 2017,virgo,"Passion could reach new heights as the Moon connects with rebellious Uranus. Tired of boring sex or just being a mom instead of a woman? Worn out with working so many hours that you have no energy left for love, hobbies, fun or just enjoying flat brain waves? Today will inspire you to bust out of those ruts, plus plenty more!

"
8 january 2017,virgo,"If big plans or hopes have been taking too much time to manifest, this Thursday’s full moon in Cancer may light a fire under you to take some serious action. Helping matters along is the return of direct motion with good old Mercury, which has been dragging its heels in your house of home and family. Residential issues can now be resolved along with putting an end to family squabbles.

"
9 january 2017,virgo,"Who’s the boss? You may feel the need to take charge of a romantic situation that’s run aground, or a business deal that’s stuck in red tape or confusion. The problem is that the other party may be in a feisty mood, so tread carefully. This vibe continues into tomorrow so you’ll need to keep your cool. Remove your emotions from the situation as best you can.

"
10 january 2017,virgo,"The next 48 hours could be a bit of an emotional roller coaster as the Sun squares Uranus in two of the most sensitive parts of your chart. Kids, lovers, co-workers, family members: they could all be in some kind of a snit, laying on guilt and drama. Take your emotions out of the equation and remember that someone has to be a grownup, and it might as well be you.

"
11 january 2017,virgo,"Serious relationships can experience a renaissance, a rebirth, thanks to dynamic Mars and metamorphic Pluto stirring up positive changes this part of your chart. But usually optimistic Jupiter is in a funky mood today, urging you to pay attention to the basics: your household or company budget, who is responsible for what duties and chores, and making sure that you’re building an alliance on solid ground. Don’t indulge in airy-fairy thoughts, expecting these things to take care of themselves. They won’t, which means that you need to attend to them.

"
12 january 2017,virgo,"Some important dreams, aspirations or projects may be coming to a well-deserved close, thanks to today’s full moon in Cancer. Conveniently, intelligent and quick-witted Mercury enters your house of creativity too, enabling you to push forward with new enterprises and give them some flair. However, some of the people around you may be resisting progress by dragging their feet or causing projects to run over budget. Keep an eye on anyone whose input or assistance you need to get things done, and make sure that they’re handling their responsibilities.

"
13 january 2017,virgo,"The planets are all in alignment for showering you with love and affection, Virgo! Mercury just entered your house of fun and romance. Yesterday’s full moon fell in the sector of fulfilling some of your biggest hopes and wishes. And now Venus and Neptune are holding a serious convo in your commitment sector! singles, be on the lookout for some serious love material. Attached Virgos: all I can say is that you deserve the best, so reach out and grab it.

"
14 january 2017,virgo,"Trust issues? Depending upon others could be frustrating as people around you could be slacking off or refusing to cooperate. It wouldn’t be a problem if you could get everything done on your own, but you can’t—and so it is. With aggressive Mars in your partnership sector, you could set a lover or your kids straight. Co-workers and friends are another story. When the Sun enters Aquarius next Thursday you’ll be able to take control of work projects, so the office slackers only have a few more days to goof off.

"
15 january 2017,virgo,"Recent planetary activity can set your creativity soaring, encouraging you to make the most of your talent. This is just as true in your personal affairs as the office, and people around you will notice your flair and positive attitude. But when it comes to working with others, choose carefully. Not everyone is as committed or skilled as you are, and you don’t need anyone slowing you down.

"
16 january 2017,virgo,"A little bit of “me” time is just what the cosmic doctor is ordering today, Virgo! You’ve had a lot of planetary emphasis lately on taking care of others, but it looks like you need to recharge your batteries. You could rest at home with a good book but the cosmos suggests a fun evening out on the town. Or a shopping spree….massage….mani/pedi….

"
17 january 2017,virgo,"If you’re looking for security in a situation, then it’s up to you to find it. Don’t fall victim to empty promises or flattery from people who can never seem to give you what you want. Whether it’s a romance, career matter or family drama, it’s time to cut bait or move upstream.
 
 

"
18 january 2017,virgo,"You’re entering into a time period which will be far more structured, not usually a problem for people of your sign. But even if you’re on top of your chores and demonstrating good habits, it doesn’t mean that the people around you are. Make sure that others know what is expected of them, whether it’s a spouse, your kids, employees, co-workers or team members. A positive Mars-Jupiter aspect today will help straighten things out. It may not happen overnight, but by the time of the new moon on the 27th you can lock in new rules.

"
19 january 2017,virgo,"The planets warn against trying to make certain relationships move faster than they currently are. Whether it’s a potential client you’re wooing, neighborhood connections you’d like to solidify or developing more momentum in a romantic alliance, you need to slow down. Impatient Mars is anxious to wrap things up, but you run the risk of annoying people if you push too hard. Chill.

"
20 january 2017,virgo,"Get ready to delegate, Virgo! The Sun has just entered the sector that governs organization and getting things done. But this doesn’t mean doing everything yourself, even if you do think that you’re the only one who can do it right! Hire new staff or household help. Do your food shopping online and have it delivered. Swap baby sitting duties with another mom in the neighborhood so that you can go out and do your errands alone. Find better service providers that know how to deliver without the headaches. Under current planetary influences, it’s up to you to get this rolling: don’t wait for a spouse or co-workers to get their s*** together.

"
21 january 2017,virgo,"Did you fall off the fitness bandwagon around January 5th or so? Then now is your best time to climb back on it and stay there. The Sun has just entered your house of vitality and health, encouraging you to focus more on your body. Treat it like the temple it is. Start researching diets, supplements, and exercise regimens that might work for you, as well as making appointments with health care practitioners. The new moon on the 27th is a great time to start afresh.

"
22 january 2017,virgo,"With the Sun now in the sector that governs the creation of better habits, it’s time to take a look at how you handle household chores and activities. A helpful Moon-Sun aspect will enable you to pinpoint weaknesses in your system so that you find hacks that will streamline and destress your life.

"
23 january 2017,virgo,"Getting the straight story from a family member or lover could be tough today, which may make you feel unsettled. With a Moon-Saturn conjunction taking place, you’re in no mood for unanswered questions, especially if they have to deal with your sense of security. But this is a temporary blip on the cosmic radar. Tomorrow is much better for getting the full scoop.

"
24 january 2017,virgo,"Your ability to express yourself with creativity and verve today is off the charts, Virgo! Naturally this bodes well for anyone in an artistic or conceptual line of work, but it also can help you communicate better with your kids or a lover in a fresh new way. It’s also a super time to get back into some hobbies that you may have neglected or have been interested in trying “some day”. Some day is here.

"
25 january 2017,virgo,"Your motivation to find new love may rise with a happy Moon-Pluto conjunction. The same holds true for those Virgos who are attached, and you may demand some changes in your relationship. The good news is that the planets are working on your behalf, enabling you to communicate your needs and expectations to your amour. Singles, a prospect with long term potential could be out there—and they could be in your line of work. Trade show or seminar, anyone?

"
26 january 2017,virgo,"Looking to develop more security and structure in a serious partnership? Then today’s the day, as optimistic Jupiter is in a good spot from your house of self-confidence and establishing happy boundaries. This vibe will continue into the following week, especially with tomorrow’s new moon in your efficient sixth house. This is no time to be flying by the seat of your pants in romantic or business alliances.

"
27 january 2017,virgo,"If you want a romance to move along more smoothly, Virgo, you may have to do some inner work. It seems that there are issues from the past, old family dramas from childhood in particular, that you need to release. But you’re in an excellent place to take new mental habits and run with them, thanks to today’s new moon in your efficient, organized sixth house. Years of therapy? Who needs it! Practicality is the name of the game as catharsis can take place quickly.

"
28 january 2017,virgo,"Padding your wallet and financial portfolio can get a heck of a lot easier now that aggressive Mars is in your house of wealth. Just yesterday a new moon occurred in the sector that governs efficiency, streamlining and landing more assignments. The message? If you want to earn more, you need to have excellent work habits, not to mention smart protocols and talented people around you. Increasing your net worth is an achievable goal as long as you pay attention to your daily efforts and the details.

"
29 january 2017,virgo,"Emotions could be bubbling under that usually calm surface of yours, Virgo! As Mercury and Pluto heat up your romance sector, you’re going to have to watch out for troublesome feelings like resentment or jealousy. Your sex life could be awesome over the next few weeks, thanks to lusty Mars in your house of libido, but be careful that you’re thinking rationally about your love life. Singles, don’t mistake steaming hot sex for love. It ain’t that simple.

"
30 january 2017,virgo,"Yowza! The planets are piling up in your houses of sex, passion and romance, so don’t be surprised if that’s all you can think of. Today is quite amorous with a steamy Moon-Neptune conjunction. Singles, it’s a good day to meet someone at a cultural event (think concert, museum, art gallery) and couples, you should plan some time alone. The cosmos doesn’t always deliver goodies like this, so carpe diem.

"
31 january 2017,virgo,"With so much recent planetary activity in your houses of romance and passion, you should be feeling quite amorous. However, erratic Uranus may be stirring up the green eyed monster or feelings of resentment. Singles, comparing yourself to others isn’t going to bring in Prince or Princess Charming. Attached Virgos need to toss negative emotions that could interfere with their relationship. Avoid outbursts and stubbornness at all costs.

"
1 february 2017,virgo,"Keep the plastic in your wallet and avoid retail therapy, Virgo. A tense Moon-Uranus aspect could bring about emotional spending. Adding to this aspect is the presence of ever-optimistic Jupiter in your income sector, which might convince you that you’ll have no problem in finding the cash to pay the bill sometime in the future. This is just the beginning of austerity: when Jupiter retrogrades on the 6th, you’ll need to stay on budget for several months.

"
2 february 2017,virgo,"Hmmm, it looks like someone needs to get their groove back. If you’re tired of being a good old dependable Virgo and long for living a more exciting, passionate lifestyle, you’re in luck. Red hot Mars is currently carving a path through your house of joy and intensity (which includes sex drive, dontcha know), telling you that you don’t have to remain in a boring old rut. Make a vow to start living a bit more of la vida loca.

"
3 february 2017,virgo,"Ggrrr! Feeling sexy, Virgo? You should be now that Venus is in your house of libido and passion. This sector isn’t just about our basic instincts, however. Being able to relate to someone on a much deeper level (can you say “soulmate”?) is found here also. But on March 4th Venus retrogrades, so if there are any issues in your romance, get them worked out before then.

"
4 february 2017,virgo,"If you’ve been longing to put more excitement into your romance—or to meet someone who knows how to enjoy life—this weekend is the time to go for it. The Moon is in the most optimistic, freewheeling part of your chart, challenging you to take ownership of your personal time and passion. There’s a saying: life is too short to drink cheap beer and dance with boring men (and women), so start pursuing la vida loca.

"
5 february 2017,virgo,"Just how much responsibility are you willing to take in your key relationships, both at home and at the office? You may not want to take charge, fearing that you’ll come off as bossy or that it’s easier to let others run the show. Sorry, Virgo! The planets suggest otherwise, telling you to start creating boundaries. While you’re at it, let everyone know what their duties are—and that you intend to hold people to them.

"
6 february 2017,virgo,"Begin a financial austerity plan (otherwise known as a budget) now, Libra! The usually abundant Jupiter is kicking off a four-month slowdown in your income sector. Clients could be hesitant to sign on the dotted line, expenses might be higher than planned, and job hunts could get stymied with delays. But this doesn’t mean that progress can’t be made. There is a benefit to a Jupiter retrograde period in that it can give you the opportunity to uncover new income streams, develop better habits and become more orderly about how you get your job done.

"
7 february 2017,virgo,"Get your “Type A” groove on, Virgo! Mercury enters your highly strategic and efficient sixth house today, telling you to get your house in order–literally and figuratively. Bring order to your home and office by decluttering, wrapping up unfinished tasks and making lists of what has to be done next. Your body is also the “home” in which your spirit resides, so take excellent care of it through healthy eating and exercise.

"
8 february 2017,virgo,"Your personal finances should be just that, Virgo: personal. Don’t get sucked into buying things because of whiny kids, a lover who wants to live a more luxe lifestyle or because your friends appear to have more “toys” than you do. Now that Jupiter is retrograde in your income sector, budgeting is the name of the game. People in your circle may resist your new austerity measures, but you’ll end up being the one with money in the bank.

"
9 february 2017,virgo,"You’ve been working hard, Virgo, and your smarts have been noticed by others. Over the next few days an assignment (or a job offer) might come your way and it could take you by surprise. The lunar eclipse on Friday occurs in your “behind closed doors” sector, so your best bet is to keep things on the downlow: job hunts, marketing strategies, product launches and client negotiations.

"
10 february 2017,virgo,"Get out the pruning shears—or maybe I should suggest a chainsaw. A megawatt lunar eclipse in the sector that governs your deepest thoughts, emotions and habits is encouraging you to cut out things that aren’t working for you. This could be toxic people, obligations that are weighing you down, or even negative thought patterns that seem to replay in your head every day. There is a strong financial focus surrounding the eclipse, so if you’re looking for more money or better working conditions now is the time to quietly start making inquiries. Over the next six months you’ll be releasing more and more “trash” from your life so that only the good stuff can come in.

"
11 february 2017,virgo,"“Nothing so needs reforming as other people’s habits.”  So said wit and author Mark Twain, but today the cosmos tells you to examine your own routines. Fortunately a superb Sun-Jupiter aspect will enable you to create solid, simple habits and rituals that will positively streamline your life. The best part is that there’s a strong financial vibe with this. The more you clean up your act, the more money you’ll save by being a smart shopper. Likewise, your productivity will be noticed by decision makers.

"
12 february 2017,virgo,"A practical approach needs to be taken to love, Virgo. Your sign is certainly not known for engaging in unrealistic fantasies, but the cosmos warns that you might fall prey to delusional thinking today. It’s also possible that a lover (or a wannabe) is blowing a lot of smoke in your direction. Keep the lines of communication open and clear.

"
13 february 2017,virgo,"The Moon in your sign may be pushing you to do something about your physique, Virgo, not to mention your health and vitality level. You’re in an excellent position to seek out a balanced diet, smart exercise routine and a good doctor, if you need one. This energy runs clear into next week, so don’t be surprised if you start waking up earlier for a morning run. With disciplined Saturn in your domestic sector a home-based routine is the way to go.

"
14 february 2017,virgo,"Your sign tends to be viewed as the ultra-practical (read: non-romantic) group of the zodiac, but there’s a lusty creature lurking beneath that pulled-together facade. Mars and Venus are both nestled in your sexy eighth house of passion and intimacy today, calling for a steamy boudoir scene. Singles, you may be in a more thoughtful mood as the Moon and Jupiter have you thinking about security and traditional love. The good news is that you can have both a serious connection and a soulmate at the same time.

"
15 february 2017,virgo,"Your income and savings may not be matching your goals for building a strong financial foundation, something that could hit you today in an emotional way. Don’t kid yourself about an upcoming promotion, job or windfall if it’s sketchy. You need earnings that are rock solid. Start seeking out sources of money that you can count on.

"
16 february 2017,virgo,"You certainly know how to get things done these days, Virgo. An inner passion is driving you to make headway, and this  energy will continue through all of next week. As a result don’t be surprised if people notice your can-do attitude and want to team up.

"
17 february 2017,virgo,"Pay attention to the fine print today, Virgo, and the words uttered by others as well. If someone is making a promise to complete a project make sure to get it in writing, or at least take your own notes. You know what thy say about verbal agreements—they’re not worth the paper they’re written on.

"
18 february 2017,virgo,"So what’s the deal? Are you staying in a relationship or getting out? Remaining a confirmed single, or are you ready to jump back into the deep end of the dating pool again? The Sun’s entry into your partnership sector will shine some light on your closest alliances, which also happens to include business partners. A solar eclipse on the 26th will be a make or break point. Start thinking things over now.

"
19 february 2017,virgo,"Sometimes you can learn more about a person–where they’re coming from, what their emotional state is all about–by sitting back and letting things flow. That’s the cosmos’s advice, Virgo, as beating someone over the head and demanding answers will backfire. Being passive can actually work in your favor.

"
20 february 2017,virgo,"Your work load could pick up this week, which may not thrill you at first as it seems that your existing loads, both at home and at the office, are already heavy. But the new opportunities could be money makers, something that could add some serious coin to your financial portfolio down the road.

"
21 february 2017,virgo,"You may need to take another look at your budget, whether it’s your household balance sheet or one at work. A superb Mercury-Jupiter trine, the best angle possible, could help you find cost-cutting measures. Creating better habits is a part of this energy, so consider what you can do to save more.

"
22 february 2017,virgo,"Common sense and cool thinking will be in short supply today, Virgo–especially at your end! You’ll be driven more by emotion, passion and ambition more than anything else, which could end up being a volatile situation. Keep your wits about you and watch your words. Don’t say anything you might regret later on.

"
23 february 2017,virgo,"Let the past inform the future. If you have a decision to make, think back to other times when you were faced with something similar and ask yourself what you can do this time to make a better choice. A helpful aspect between two of the most logical planets, Mercury and Saturn, will ease the process.

"
24 february 2017,virgo,"There are plenty of good reasons to work out and take excellent care of your health: lower blood pressure, a more supple body, fewer aches and pains. But what about looking smokin’ hot and sexy? Huh? Is it a crime to exercise so that you leave a trail of salivating, lusty admirers in your wake? I think not. A sassy little Moon-Venus aspect today tells you that vanity isn’t such a bad thing.

"
25 february 2017,virgo,"Serious relationships take center stage with two big aspects occurring this weekend. Today chatty Mercury enters your commitment sector, followed by a lunar eclipse on Sunday. These are awesome placements for meeting a potential spouse, making progress with a lover or inking a deal with a business collaborator. The next six months are game changers.

"
26 february 2017,virgo,"Should I stay or should I go? An eclipse in your house of key relationships, business and personal, asks that question. If a certain connection has been less than rewarding over the past months or years, you may decide to cut the cords and move on. But you could also move forward in a big way with someone who wants to be part of your life, such as getting engaged or signing a deal with an agent. Just make sure that you’re totally clear about the financial history of anyone you partner with.

"
27 february 2017,virgo,"Feeling lustier than a pirate on shore leave? Blame it on a fiery meet up of the two most hotblooded planets–Mars and Uranus–in your house of passion. Yowza! Just don’t get blinded by sex and drama. Otherwise, get thee to the boudoir.

"
28 february 2017,virgo,"Moody blues! Intense emotions may arise as the passionate Moon meets up with Venus. Someone close may try to push your buttons, such as a lover or a child. You can’t let them take control of this situation no matter how much you love them. Sometimes tough love works, and that’s the way you need to go today.

"
1 march 2017,virgo,"Your love life can take quite a glamorous turn thanks to a yummy Sun-Neptune meeting in the heavens. Singles, you could meet a sexy new suitor who knows how to savor the finer things. And if you’re involved in a romance that has grown a little dull, now’s the time to spice things up. Use your imagination, which is getting fired up for more fun thanks to Neptune’s amorous influence.

"
3 march 2017,virgo,"Just how much freedom do you need in your closest relationships? A Moon-Pluto trine asks that question of you today. If someone has been holding you back from going after your dreams, or you don’t feel as though you can express who you truly are, it’s time for some soul-searching. Once assertive Mars changes signs on the 9th you’ll be ready to bust out of confining situations.

"
4 march 2017,virgo,"If your romance needs some serious repair work the next four weeks will make it glaringly obvious! Venus retrogrades today in your house of intimacy and libido, so matters of the boudoir could really be on your radar—not to mention money. Watch the tendency to get embroiled in arguments. Singles, if you’re still brooding over a breakup the month ahead could be an emotional one. Be wary of exes on the comeback trail too.

"
5 march 2017,virgo,"Figuring out what makes us feel comfortable and content can sometimes be difficult, especially when we’re busily keeping other people happy. But today you can focus on your own needs and emotions. The Taoists have a saying: no matter where you are, you’re always home. “Home” is the inner peace that you can carry with you everywhere.

"
6 march 2017,virgo,"Can we talk? Love planet Venus just went retrograde in your house of intimacy and sex, which means that issues that need to be addressed will come bubbling to the surface. Fortunately diplomatic Mercury is on the job today, helping you open up and speak your piece. The whole week is good for holding talks, by the way, so get them started right now. Singles–get the word out that you’re on the market.

"
7 march 2017,virgo,"Listen to your own voice today, Virgo. Friends and colleagues may be plying you with their advice, but from your chart it appears that their opinions are off base. Your choice of lover, career and lifestyle is your own. March to the beat of your own drum—especially after Thursday, when Mars enters the most optimistic part of your chart.

"
8 march 2017,virgo,"Yum! A sweet Mercury-Pluto aspect encourages you to get flirty with your amour, and maybe even talk about the more serious stuff while you’re at it. Singles, with both the Sun and Mercury in your house of commitment, a keeper may be in your midst. With Mars about to enter your house of travel and education, you could meet a new honey at a vacation destination or in the stacks.

"
9 march 2017,virgo,"Boundaries? Limits? What the hell are they? They’re meant to be broken, Virgo! Now that ambitious Mars is in your house of adventure it’s time to take some risks. Nothing stupid, mind you. Just breaking away from doing things the same old way. With Sunday’s full moon coming in your house of self-image it’s time to dump an old, worn-out self image and replace it with something far more intriguing.

"
10 march 2017,virgo,"Resolving issues in love or with family members becomes easier with today’s planetary aspects. Sunday’s full moon falls in Virgo, putting your needs on the front burner. Work things out now with the people closest to you so that you can focus on your own passion projects over the next six months.

"
11 march 2017,virgo,"It’s time to get your finances in order, Virgo. This is one of your best years in over a decade to increase your bottom line, but it won’t happen unless you’re paying attention to what’s going on around you. Under current planetary aspects your best bet for earning more may come from joining forces with someone else. This could mean a standard business partnership, or retaining the services of a savvy expert to help you achieve your goals— a booking agent, manager, literary agent, talent scout or PR person would all qualify.

"
12 march 2017,virgo,"Woo-hoo! Tonight’s full moon falls in your sign, Virgo. This is a terrific time to wrap up projects that you may have initiated over the past six months so that you can go after some new ones. Truth be told, some of the people closest to you may not be 100% on board with your ideas, but who cares. You’re going to do what you want anyhow. With Pluto pushing you to have some fun and show off your talent, don’t let anyone talk you into standing along the sidelines.

"
13 march 2017,virgo,"Does a romance need repair work? If so, Mercury’s move into Aries today is just the ticket for opening up the lines of communication. Venus has been retrograde here for about a week, possibly stirring up doubts and concerns. But now the lines of communication open wide. Singles, a sexy new flame is on the horizon, especially after the 20th.

"
14 march 2017,virgo,"Developing a stronger financial foundation is a big theme for you this year, Virgo, but you can’t do it if other people are pulling on the purse strings. Don’t let a lover, kids or family members convince you to spend money on things you can’t afford. If an ex or someone else owes you money (in a court case, say) today could be difficult. But when the Sun enters your finance sector next week you start to gain control.

"
15 march 2017,virgo,"Start thinking on a more long term basis when it comes to your finances. Stern Saturn wants you to develop a nest egg and the peace of mind that comes along with it. The new moon on the 28th is perfect for launching new savings and income strategies, so start planning now.

"
16 march 2017,virgo,"Choose your words carefully, Virgo, and consider your ”audience”. You may be feeling open and emotional, willing to share your thoughts and feelings, but others may not be in that place today or tomorrow. They could dismiss your opinions, something that could lead to hurt feelings. But this changes next week, especially in romance, when the Sun enters Aries on Monday.

"
17 march 2017,virgo,"Think twice before entering into any kind of major agreement: buying a home, getting married or joining forces with a business partner, as examples. With long-term Saturn in one of the sectors that deals with emotional security, you need to know first that the people or deals you’re aligning with are the right ones.

"
18 march 2017,virgo,"Yowza! What a passionate day lies ahead for Virgos, as love planet Venus meets up with communicative Mercury ion the house of libido and intimacy. This weekend is custom made for canoodling behind closed doors, not to mention sharing some of your deepest thoughts. Singles, your chances of meeting someone who qualifies as a soulmate are excellent once the Sun changes signs on Monday.

"
19 march 2017,virgo,"Drawing a line in the sand may be necessary as this week brings some tense aspects. Unless you want to get pulled into the dramas that other people create, or their agendas, you either need to step away quietly or tell them to back off. With strict Saturn trying to protect your emotional state, this shouldn’t be as difficult as it might sound.

"
20 march 2017,virgo,"Sometimes we need to clear the cobwebs from our minds and perform some spiritual cleansing. Negative emotions like jealousy and resentment can build up, shutting us down to the people closest to us. But now that the Sun is in Aries you can heal your tired mind and soul. Energy work, mindfulness, meditation–all of these can be of value, along with opening the lines of communication with your loved ones.

"
21 march 2017,virgo,"Frustration may build over a relationship, be it personal or business. You may be anxious to move it along or see improvement in it, but the other party may not be ready yet. From your chart it appears that this will be a seesaw situation over the next few weeks, so learn how to be patient. Bide your time. The new moon on the 28th will help your cause.

"
22 march 2017,virgo,"The details of a financial situation may take some time to work out. Whereas today has good aspects for making progress, the end of the week is mired in red tape and people who can’t agree. Wait until Sunday or Monday, when things may turn around quickly. The new moon on the 28th is your best lunation all year for launching a new, more prosperous chapter.

"
23 march 2017,virgo,"Are you a lover or a fighter? You may have to choose today as the heavens produce a tense Pluto-Mercury aspect. Emotions and harsh words could flow between you and your amour, kids or even someone at work, especially if you’re in the creative field. Take a deep breath and count to ten, as this negative energy continues into tomorrow. Don’t say or do anything you’ll regret. The good news is that things improve on Saturday and get even better by Tuesday’s new moon.

"
24 march 2017,virgo,"Keep your credit cards locked up today, Virgo! A tense Mercury-Jupiter face-off could make your eyes bigger than your wallet. The same holds true for borrowing large amounts of money, say for a house or car. Be conservative when making financial decisions, from the smallest to the biggest. This is no time for rose colored glasses.

"
25 march 2017,virgo,"Pull down the shades and lower the lights! A sexy Venus-Sun connection in your house of sexuality and intimacy makes for one romantic weekend. If you’re single with no hot prospects in sight, don’t despair. Tuesday’s new moon in Aries is your ticket for meeting a companion who will be more than just someone to date. We’re talking soulmate material here. Over the next six months you could meet someone who breaks the mold.

"
27 march 2017,virgo,"What many people don’t know is that love planet Venus also governs profits. Well, Virgo, the golden gal is smiling today as she tries to show you the money and we’re not talking about chump change here. What’s even better is that Venus is the planet of ease, so solidifying your financial base may not be as difficult as you might expect.

"
28 march 2017,virgo,"A highly romantic time can begin in your life, thanks to a sweet new moon in your house of intimacy and bonding. Love planet Venus is in an excellent angle to the Moon, helping singles find a soulmate and attached Virgos to deepen their bond. With Mars in your mind-expanding and adventurous ninth house, you might be willing to date a completely different type or become more open and vulnerable with your amour.

"
29 march 2017,virgo,"If boundaries need to be set with loved ones, today’s a good time to have that conversation. With disciplinarian Saturn in a good spot you can get your point across with both firmness and kindness. You weren’t put on this planet to be the family maid or work horse; others need to pick up some slack.

"
30 march 2017,virgo,"Remember this: you are the captain of your own ship. You are in control of your thoughts, emotions and destiny. No one else. This will become apparent as a tense Jupiter-Pluto square could bring about a conflict in which someone tries to push you into doing something their way. You don’t need to be a pawn, a servant or codependent. Stand up for your ideas, rights and your future path.

"
31 march 2017,virgo,"“Adventure is my middle name.” It’s time to take on a more out-there persona, Virgo, thanks to Mercury entering your expansive ninth house. Why spend your life coloring within the lines when you can splash bright colors everywhere? Take a few risks, even if they’re small ones. One little adventure will build on another until the point where you look back and realize that you’re in a completely different place.

"
1 april 2017,virgo,"Planetary influences indicate that you may be feeling confined by a relationship, whether it’s a personal or business one. Now that Mercury is in your no-holds-barred house of adventure, you’re ready to rock and roll—but is someone or something holding you back? Consider if any changes need to be made, then make them. Once Venus resumes direct motion on the 15th momentum will build.

"
2 april 2017,virgo,"Hmm…does this relationship need an upgrade? Serious partnerships, in love as well as business, are under a magnifying glass until the 15th as Venus retrogrades in this sector. If you haven’t been happy with the ways things have been going, now is the time to speak up and try to make some progress. Next week’s full moon falls in your house of stability. If you want more of it, you’re going to have to demand it.

"
3 april 2017,virgo,"Team efforts get a boost today with a Moon-Neptune connection. Whether you’re planning a family reunion or world domination with a killer new business, creative Neptune will provide you with plenty of inspiration. Trouble is, the authoritative Sun is standing off to the side, questioning the budget of this venture. Make sure the money is there.

"
4 april 2017,virgo,"Your heart may be in the right place but you run the risk of making promises you can’t fulfill. Or, you’re dreaming way too big for your current budget. In any case you need to take a step back for a reality check. Planetary aspects over the next week will yank you down to Earth with a thud otherwise, especially next Tuesday’s full moon in your income sector.

"
5 april 2017,virgo,"Make an effort to reach out to people you’ve fallen out of touch with, Virgo. It’s possible under current planetary influences to start afresh with them. You’ve changed recently as a person, and this will be apparent when you open up the lines of communication with others.

"
6 april 2017,virgo,"Family and housing issues may hit some snags over the next five months as Saturn begins its annual slowdown. Selling a house, getting pregnant, resolving problems with your parents, moving in with your lover—all of these matters could get delayed as the ringed planet retrogrades. Believe it or not though, this could be beneficial. Saturn is the planet of maturity, logical planning and the long term. You now have the opportunity to think things through and do them right.

"
7 april 2017,virgo,"Abundant Jupiter is traveling through your income sector, which should  be a blessing when it coms to earning and saving more. The problem is that Jupiter’s optimism can sometimes lead to rose-colored glasses thinking, which is the issue today. Don’t kid yourself about a raise, job opportunity or revenue stream. It’s not they’re not going to pay off—they can, but you shouldn’t be spending the money before you earn it.

"
8 april 2017,virgo,"This could be an emotional weekend as not one but two squares create friction in close relationships. You may be asking for answers or guarantees from someone that they’re not ready or willing to provide. With two stern planets involved—Pluto and Saturn—things could get forceful. Wait for Tuesday’s full moon to lay down some new rules and expectations.

"
9 april 2017,virgo,"Mercury goes retrograde today and of all the signs you need to be double checking travel plans and contracts! That’s because the messenger planet is perched in your ninth house of legal matters and long distance travel. This is also the sector of education, so make sure term papers and theses absolutely sparkle. The same holds true for any documents that need to be filled out for a governmental agency, such as your citizenship papers or motor vehicle papers. The good news? This is over by the 20th.

"
10 april 2017,virgo,"Initiatives that you start up over the next few months could pay off handsomely, Virgo, but don’t count your chickens before they hatch. Keep projects on task and more importantly, on budget. And if you need to polish up your skills by taking a class or working with a mentor, do so.

"
11 april 2017,virgo,"Abundant Jupiter has been in your income sector since October, and the effort you’ve been putting in is about to pay off. The full moon in the same house could usher in a promotion, raise, new job or deep pocketed client. However, with Pluto in a tough spot from your house of swag and luxury items, you may be tempted to treat yourself to some pricey goodies. Don’t–at least not yet. You need to sock away more in savings before you can spend.

"
12 april 2017,virgo,"Need to mend fences or have a serious conversation with someone close? Then today’s the day, as a helpful Moon-Neptune trine will enable you to speak with passion and clarity. This holds true for business contacts as well as personal ones. You’ll be able to make even more progress after Saturday when Venus resumes direct motion.

"
13 april 2017,virgo,"Put an end to petty arguments today. This holds true for all the people in your life, but especially with a lover. You don’t have to twist someone’s arm to get your point across. With the emotional Moon in a good spot your words will quietly speak for themselves.

"
14 april 2017,virgo,"Spontaneity can be a good thing…or it can lead to problems! Unpredictable Uranus meets up with the Sun today in your wealth sector, indicating that an opportunity to improve your finances could be around the corner. But the key is to make sure you have all the facts and know whom you’re dealing with first. Jumping into a “surefire thing” too quickly could have the opposite effect.

"
14 april 2016,virgo,"Over the next few days a number of sparkling aspects are going to help you ditch drama, resentment and all the other ugly emotions that we humans cook up. So if there has been any bad mojo surrounding your relationship with a lover or kids, start patching things up today. You’ll be glad you did.

"
15 april 2017,virgo,"Phew. Venus, planet of amour, finally goes direct in your commitment sector after spinning backwards for over a month. This hasn’t been an easy placement for you as it has most likely tested your union. Singles may have felt as though they were walking through the desert with nary a potential mate in sight. And to top it off, an ex may have appeared back on the scene! Things calm down and become more clear, and once the Sun enters Taurus on the 19th, more fun.

"
16 april 2017,virgo,"It’s time to take a gamble in life, Virgo, whether it’s with a love connection, a business venture or traveling around the world. The next four weeks are perfect for initiating big changes, and a Mars-Venus aspect today will help you start daydreaming and planning. If you’ve been putting too many things off, waiting for “someday”….well, someday is here. Now.

"
17 april 2017,virgo,"If you’re seeking more stability with your finances or love life–or both–a helpful Sun-Saturn aspect smooths the way. Solutions to problems will arise, you’ll be able to speak more openly with people and a sense of balance will start to develop. But nothing will happen unless you take action, so start thinking and communicating.

"
18 april 2017,virgo,"Button pusher alert! Someone close may try to rile you up today and it’s your job to remain calm. When Pluto begins to retrograde on Thursday you’ll have five months to examine your emotions, such as jealousy, fear and resentment. If you’re too quick to give up your power to others, or you easily get pulled into dramas that you’d be better off avoiding, then the cosmos is going to help you develop more sang froid  (which is French for being really chill).

"
19 april 2017,virgo,"Ain’t nothin’ holding you back now that the Sun is in your house of adventure! Or–is there? Loved ones may be tugging at you in the weeks ahead, demanding attention and maybe even playing head games. If you want to make the most of this positive solar energy, you may need to point out to others that you do have limits–and they’re pushing them.

"
20 april 2017,virgo,"If drama is not your thing you’re going to have to work hard to avoid it over the next few months, Virgo. That’s because Pluto begins to retrograde in your fifth house of romance and close connections. Exes may return, jealousy and obsession could spike and you may be looking for trouble. Or—not. The choice is yours to make.

"
21 april 2017,virgo,"Lucky you—ambitious Mars is now in your house of….ambition! This is its first visit to this part of your chart in two years, so you’re now in an awesome position to make progress with any goal of your choosing. Helping you along is Pluto, which went retrograde yesterday in your creativity sector. Tap into the wellspring of talent and inspiration that we all have and dig deep. You may end up realizing that there are better, more cutting edge ways to go about your plans.

"
22 april 2017,virgo,"Romance needs a reality check with a stern Venus-Saturn square. Don’t kid yourself—if you’re in a relationship with too much drama, not enough communication and a lot of doubts, you need to do some reflecting. Saturn is the planet of long-term stability and it happens to be in your house of romance. Like a kindly grandfather, he wants you to be in only the very best relationship. Try to work things out or move on.

"
23 april 2017,virgo,"Matters of the heart could be touchy these days, courtesy of both Mercury and Pluto going retrograde in your romance sectors this past Thursday. But today is a bright spot as the Moon and love planet meet up, allowing you to speak your mind with a loved one. Sometimes the best way to communicate is to just spend some quality time together, alone. Head out to a park, museum or the beach and let your hair down.

"
24 april 2017,virgo,"This is no time for flings or relationships that are flimsy. Nor is it wise to hook up with a sexy but untrustworthy ex who may come sniffing around, a possibility with Mercury retrograde in your house of sex and intimacy. Nope, the cosmos wants you to find the real deal or make an existing relationship stronger. Today’s powerful Mercury-Saturn trine can make it happen.

"
25 april 2017,virgo,"Let it flow! Allowing yourself to be more vulnerable with the people you love is advised with a happy Uranus-Saturn trine, the best possible aspect in astrology. If you’re used to keeping a stiff upper lip when it comes to managing your emotions with family members or a lover, it’s time to speak up. They need to know your thoughts and feelings. Being a martyr doesn’t serve anyone.

"
26 april 2017,virgo,"Hiding in the shadows while you watch everyone else have a life? I don’t think so! The new moon in Taurus occurs in the most expansive part of your chart, telling you to start taking more chances—in love, career choices, travel, education, and your overall lifestyle. If some of your dreams cost money, then Venus’s move on Friday will help you develop the cash to fund them.

"
26 april 2016,virgo,"Romance heats up big time with libidinous Mars meeting up with with swaggering Pluto. Flirting, canoodling, bodice-ripping action in the boudoir: yup, it’s all in the stars! Your judgment could be a bit muddled, though, so look before you leap (or tear your clothes off).

"
27 april 2017,virgo,"Letting someone else control your love life isn’t the way to go, Virgo. If you’ve been stifling your opinions and feelings it’s time to let them loose. Singles, you need be more outspoken about what you want out of love. Get clear on that now so when the time comes that a new love enters your life, you’re ready to determine if they have what it takes.

"
28 april 2017,virgo,"Reaching a deeper level of emotional and sexual intimacy is possible, thanks to magnetic Venus entering your house of bonding. Now is the time to work out issues, as Venus’s presence will allow progress to be made without a lot of drama. Singles, a soulmate is out there for you, not a fling. Raise your standards and start hunting while the planets are in your favor.

"
29 april 2017,virgo,"Stop taking your job or business home with you, Virgo. Whether you’re spending time on the weekend actually doing work, or the stress is hanging over your head like a dark rain cloud, it’s gotta go. The recent new moon fell in your house of adventure and trying new things. It’s Saturday, babe. Get out there and enjoy life!

"
30 april 2017,virgo,"This is the perfect weekend for planning a rager of a party, a family vacation, church bake sale, charity gala or industry get together. The power is with the people, the more the merrier. Seek the advice and companionship of others, as they are going to be a big part of your happiness and success in the weeks and months to come.

"
1 may 2017,virgo,"You may need to come down hard on someone today, but there’s no need to completely freak out. Mercury’s retrograde, stirring up your emotions. While the other party may deserve your annoyance, you run the risk of being way too emo. Things will start to smooth over once the messenger planet goes direct on Wednesday.

"
2 may 2017,virgo,"Shhh! Whatever schemes you’re dreaming up, keep ‘em on the downlow as the mysterious Moon urges caution. All 537 of your Facebook friends don’t need to know that you just met a hottie or you’re thinking of leaving your job. Your colleagues don’t need to hear about how fed up you are. Want to see some changes? Then go into secret agent mode and move on.

"
3 may 2017,virgo,"Romantic relationships start to become more relaxed and even more libidinous as Mercury goes direct in the house of intimacy. The past few weeks may have been testy, full of drama and unpleasant emotions. Trust issues, jealousy, snooping…yuk. The good news is that it’s over (or it should be!). Singles, you’re in a sweet spot to meet a sexy new soulmate.

"
4 may 2017,virgo,"Your sign always takes the heat for being so damn practical, so much so that people don’t always realize that there’s a fun-loving, sexy individual hiding behind that efficient exterior. Well Virgo, it’s time to let your inner hedonistic self come out and play. A sizzling Sun-Neptune aspect helps kick open the doors to Playland. Run through and have a good time.

"
5 may 2017,virgo,"Thinking about going global with a business, or at least nationwide? Thinking about expanding your brand’s reach via social media? Ready to plunge into a new income stream, or perhaps even a different occupation altogether? Then start doing some research, Virgo. The Sun is currently in the most mind-expanding part of your chart, encouraging you to think big and bold. The full moon on the 10th is perfect for getting down to brass tacks and hammering out a strategy.

"
6 may 2017,virgo,"The Moon in your sign might make you feel territorial, as though you need to protect your “turf”, whatever that might be: your opinions, your space, freedom, time, job, relationships, and so on. The reality is that although there may  be people around you who are trying to get their way, you may be getting over emotional about it. That’s because next week’s full moon occurs in one of the most passionate parts of your chart. Relax and inject some logic into your attitude.

"
7 may 2017,virgo,"You’re in luck on the money front as abundant Jupiter has your back until the fall. Today it meets up with the vibey Moon, helping you get in touch with your true career passion. If you’re not thrilled with the line of work that you’re in it may be time to make some changes. But you need to closely consider whether partnering with others is a smart bet or not, as murky Neptune will retrograde in June in the business alliance part of your chart.

"
8 may 2017,virgo,"Hold on to your wallet this week, Virgo, as pricey baubles, designer duds and shiny new electronics may be calling your name—not to mention posh vacations, dream houses and sexy sports cars. Your savings don’t seem to match your dreams, at least not right now. Logical Mercury encourages you to sock away more cash in retirement accounts and other safe investments rather than impulse purchases.

"
9 may 2017,virgo,"If there was ever a time to get in touch with who you really are it’s now, Virgo! A fabulous Sun-Pluto trine allows you to get in touch with your “authentic self” and let the world know all about it. Stop playing roles that have run their course—the dutiful daughter, the soccer mom or dad, the responsible corporate slug. No one is telling you to misbehave, however! This is more about letting other aspects of your personality shine. We’re multi-faceted creatures, we humans: why stick with just one image?

"
10 may 2017,virgo,"Something significant may come to pass in the near future, something that you may have been working on (or praying for!) for some time. Tonight’s full moon takes place in your house of communication, so there could be some happy news on the way. It could be about love or starting a family, with Pluto sending shimmering beams from this part of your chart. It could be about money (the big kind) thanks to Uranus in fine form in your house of wealth. Going back to school, traveling, landing book deals, getting licensed—all of these are possible due to the location of the Sun. Want to start something in one of these areas? That’s well aspected too, so get moving.

"
11 may 2017,virgo,"Wonky day in the cosmos with aggressive Mars squaring deceptive Neptune. You  may be on task, willing to do whatever it takes to get something done, but others around you could be slacking or worse—deliberately throwing a monkey wrench into the proceedings in an attempt to slow things down. Chances are you won’t get a straight answer from them so don’t bother putting anyone on the spot. You’re on a roll, so keep the momentum going and don’t let their games slow your progress.

"
12 may 2017,virgo,"You should be beyond motivated, thanks to assertive Mars blazing a path through the most ambitious part of your chart. And today the red planet forms a magnificent trine with abundant Jupiter. The message from the cosmos? Don’t hold back! Seriously, your goals or plans may be a wee bit small. If there was ever a time to think in broader brushstrokes it’s now, Virgo. There’s a strong profit potential considering that Jupiter’s in your earnings sector, so if one of your desires is to earn more this is a good time to go after the green.

"
13 may 2017,virgo,"Risk versus comfort: it’s a battle we all have to deal with, regardless of our zodiac sign. But today the cosmos asks Virgos to consider how much you’re willing to put yourself on the line. With stern Saturn in your stable fourth house of emotional security you may be looking for guarantees, not challenges. But with the Sun in the most adventurous part of your chart, it may be time to change up your life in a few ways, even if they’re small.

"
14 may 2017,virgo,"What you think turns into what you say and the tone in which you say it. Are you expressing yourself in the very best way possible, Virgo? Naturally you’re going to speak to your kids differently than the way you’d talk to a client, but the cosmos is suggesting that you switch up your methods. A helpful Neptune-Jupiter aspect will enable you to think more creatively about the best way to self-express. This goes for written work and artistic endeavors too, so let the inspiration flow.

"
15 may 2017,virgo,"Get in touch with your inner DaVinci or Mozart. Or perhaps you want to have moves like Jagger. Do you want to dress with as much creativity and flamboyance as Frida Kahlo? Maybe Georgia O’Keeffe’s minimalist, almost monastic style would work for you better. The cosmos tells you to become more of an artiste  in your daily life, regardless as to whether you’re a soccer mom or a corporate CEO.

"
16 may 2017,virgo,"Visionary! That’s what people will be saying about you now that Mercury is in the most worldly, mind-expanding part of your chart. Don’t be surprised if you start craving more opportunities to grow as a human being, whether it’s through your career, love, education or travel. When the Sun enters your ambition and success sector this Saturday, you can take that vision and apply it to your plans. This is no time for thinking small.

"
17 may 2017,virgo,"Your desk and to-do list seem to be piling up with activities, and if you try to do them all you’ll end up feeling overwhelmed. Fortunately a productive Moon-Jupiter meeting will inspire you to prioritize what needs to be done so that you can sail through your day efficiently. Becoming more productive doesn’t have to be as painful as getting a root canal.

"
18 may 2017,virgo,"Love. sex and money: always an interesting combination. And today, the two planets that govern profits, Venus and Jupiter, are in a cranky mood. Which means: keep the plastic in your wallet. Think before you sign on the dotted line for that big mortgage or car payment. Venus is in one of the romance sectors, so you may also find it difficult to communicate with a lover. Either that, or someone is playing you with so much attention and flattery that you may be suspicious of their motives. Tread warily in matters of the heart and finance over the next few days!

"
19 may 2017,virgo,"Ggrrrrr, tiger! Spontaneous Uranus is acting up (in a good way) in your sexy eighth house of libido and intimacy, telling you to loosen up the strings on that bodice of yours and get your groove back. Serious Saturn has been making you crave comfort and security in love over the past two years, but today maverick Uranus suggests to make your life a lot juicier! This isn’t a flash in the pan either: this energy continues all the way into November. So bring sexy back.

"
20 may 2017,virgo,"No one can accuse your sign of being a group of slackers, and now that the Sun is in Gemini you can really put the pedal to the metal. Gemini is your tenth house of ambition and success so get ready to plunge into your goals with a fresh new attitude and energy level. The only word of warning is that you’ll need to balance your efforts with some quiet down time for yourself and loved ones. This may really become apparent on the 25th and 29th, as stern Saturn will remind you of your other priorities. Otherwise you’re in a good spot to make progress, especially with brainy Mercury in your visionary house of taking risks.

"
21 may 2017,virgo,"The next two days can be highly cathartic if you allow them to be. With the Moon in Aries, your eighth house of deep emotions and thoughts, it’s possible to get to the root of discontent, jealousy, fears or whatever else may be blocking your progress. Even if you’re not dealing with these emotions it’s still a wonderful time to get in touch with your more spiritual side.

"
22 may 2017,virgo,"Yum! Sexy Venus sidles up to the romantic Moon in your house of libido and intimacy. Who says Mondays are awful? Not if you’re a Virgo! Strut your stuff, you gorgeous thang. You never know who may be looking. And if you’re in a relationship (or just wanna have some fun), this is a good day for canoodling under the covers.

"
23 may 2017,virgo,"Obsessing over your schedule, to-do lists and goals will make for one burned out Virgo. The good news is that go-getter Mars is in your house of ambition. The bad news is that Mars is in your house of ambition! While the red planet can do an awesome job of motivating you, it can also lead to becoming impatient to the point of aggressiveness. In the process you may forget that you have a personal life and loved ones who need some attention. Try to maintain some balance in the weeks ahead.

"
24 may 2017,virgo,"Your emotions toward someone close may be going all over the map this week. Today you may be feeling happy and affectionate, tomorrow resentment or jealousy could be on the menu. It’s time to get a better grip on your feelings, Virgo. And tomorrow’s new moon should help you do the trick as it falls in your confident, authoritative tenth house. If others are running hot and cold with you then you either need to step away or straighten these people out.

"
25 may 2017,virgo,"Feeling more confident and in control? You should be with the new moon occurring in the most authoritative part of your chart. Not only can you put a lot of energy into making more money or finding a new career, but you’ll also be able to speak your mind when it comes to romance. It’s high time that you stopped resorting to jealousy or mistrust. Feeling comfortable in your own skin is a must if you’re going to take charge of your life.

"
26 may 2017,virgo,"The North Node of the Moon deals with the karmic lessons in life that we are destined to learn, and today the Node is calling your name. It’s situated in the most nurturing, healing part of your chart, helping you release some baggage that needs to go. And this can happen quickly, mind you. Spontaneous Uranus is in a terrific angle today and all weekend, so change could occur more rapidly than you might expect.

"
27 may 2017,virgo,"You’re no longer willing to let other people take control of key relationships, whether it’s at work or your private life. If bosses, clients or colleagues have been yanking you around it’s time to let them know that you’re not their go-to person. The same goes for a lover, family members or your kids. The good news is that you can do this diplomatically. Reaching out to them with both logic and  emotion will work. You’re stepping into a more powerful place and your self-esteem will grow as a result.

"
28 may 2017,virgo,"It’s a good day to speak your mind, and the people in your circle should be open to what you have to say. Considering entering into a new relationship, whether it’s a romantic one or for business? New connections are highly favored for you right now, so keep an open mind about fresh alliances.

"
29 may 2017,virgo,"You haven’t been feeling too footloose and fancy free lately,  not with so much cosmic emphasis on getting things done (and we’re talking about the big stuff here, not your food shopping). It might all start catching up with you courtesy of a tense Saturn-Mars smackdown in the heavens. If you need some down time, take it Virgo. Do it now before you go off the deep end! The good news is that aspects for the rest of the week are designed to bring more fun into your life.

"
30 may 2017,virgo,"A surprising source of income or cash could come your way, and you’d be wise to take a good look at it. Whether it’s a job offer, a passive income stream or an idea you have for an invention or business you could really score some nice bucks down the road. A visionary aspect tomorrow is just the ticket for exploring your options.

"
31 may 2017,virgo,"While you can usually impress people with your pragmatic attitude, now’s the time to dazzle others with creativity. A sparkling Mercury-Pluto trine in the most free-spirited parts of your chart allows you to dig deep into that well of innovative thoughts that resides within you and pull out some gems.

"
1 june 2017,virgo,"Getting clear about your feelings becomes easier, thanks to gentle Venus helping you from your house of deep emotions. Saturn adds a stabilizing effect, ensuring that you maturely move past old feelings of jealousy, fear and resentment. If you need to open up to someone close, such as a lover or family member, now is the time to do so. Next week’s full moon on the 9th is designed to bring you a greater sense of confidence and serenity, but why wait till then to feel that way?

"
1 june 2016,virgo,"Creative differences? Tension could build today between you and a business associate. The Sun in your career house is firing you up to move onward and upward, but there may be some differences of opinion that have to be resolved first. A romantic partner may also not share your vision. This energy will build as Friday approaches and a Grand Cross occurs in the heavens. Don’t expect to resolve this today!

"
2 june 2017,virgo,"Gotta love it! The two most optimistic orbs in the solar system, Jupiter and the Sun, are forming a trine today, which is one of the best aspects possible. Your desire to turn your ideas into reality should ramp up considerably. Instead of feeling, “Oh my God, I have  to plough through this grunt work”, you should feel excited about diving into your plans. Just don’t forget to leave some quality time for yourself.

"
2 june 2016,virgo,"Dreamy Neptune is in fine angle to the Moon, stirring up your passion and desire to have a rewarding romantic relationship. The North Node of the Moon is asking, however, why you feel the need to be stuck—in an unhappy situation, settling for less. If that’s your case, it’s time to do some soul searching and make a decision—do I stay or do I go? Happily involved Virgos could be inspired to take their relationship to higher level. The message from the planets is to move onward and upward, living a bigger and more satisfying life.

"
3 june 2017,virgo,"Bring out the emojis! The usually calm, cool and collected Virgo could turn into a steaming cauldron of bubbling emotions thanks to an energetic and combustible Venus-Uranus connection. All sorts of, uh, interesting  things could happen if your emotions get verbalized. So if you’re angry, resentful or jealous, you could be spewing venom. On the other hand you could unexpectedly spill your desire to make passionate love to someone who’s been on your radar for awhile. If in doubt, keep your lips zipped. Once chatty Mercury enters your authoritative tenth house on Tuesday you’ll be in a better place to vent or pursue your desires.

"
3 june 2016,virgo,"You’ll be ready the throw in the towel and tell everyone around you to figure out their own damn problems by the time today is over, Virgo! A Grand Cross occurs in the heavens, with a bevy of planets opposing each other. It’s you versus your partner, family and employer. Incessant demands from these folks may find you reaching a point in which you say, “Enough!” And you’re right. There’s only so much one person can do. However, matters at the office could start to ease up as early as next Monday, so telling your boss to take his job and stick where the Sun don’t shine won’t be necessary. The smart Virgo chills out over the weekend and takes a cool assessment about who’s being fair and who’s not, which commitments can stay and those that need to go.

"
4 june 2017,virgo,"First the good news: Mars enters your chummy eleventh house of networking, socializing, meeting new people and teamwork. Now for the less than stellar news: Mars can act like a bull in a china shop in whatever house it happens to be in. Which means that team members or friends could slack off, act up, create unnecessary dramas or not play nice in general. Fortunately shrewd Mercury enters your tenth house of maturity and authority on Tuesday. You may end up feeling like the only grown up in a group, but that’s better than being the whining baby.

"
5 june 2017,virgo,"You’re the boss of your own life, which means that your time and commitments are in your control. If others think they have the right to intrude in your decision making process, not to mention disrupt your peace, you need to set them straight. Don’t fall for guilt trips and martyr routines; most of the people around you are quite capable of taking care of themselves.

"
6 june 2017,virgo,"Hmmm, ready to take a risk in romance? Singles, you might entertain a new kind of lover, someone whom you might not have considered in the past. Coupled up Virgos could find themselves seeking adventure by heading off to an exotic vacation destination or taking a class together. How about scuba diving or flamenco dancing? Blame it on amorous Venus, which has just entered your expansive ninth house of free-spirited living. Carpe diem!

"
7 june 2017,virgo,"Your most cherished goals and ambitions get a big boost as quick thinking, rational Mercury joins the Sun in the success sector of your chart. If people or circumstances have been holding you back, you’re now in a visionary enough place to see it. While the Sun can provide you with ambition, Mercury acts like a military general, planning out strategies and the smartest way to get from point A to point B.

"
8 june 2017,virgo,"We all crave security when it comes to love and money. Fortunately the cosmos is trying to provide you with both. You may have to revise the way you’re going about it, though. With tomorrow’s full moon falling in one of the most comfort-driven parts of your chart this is not the time for any risky moves in matters of the heart or finances.

"
9 june 2017,virgo,"The Sagittarius full moon occurs in one of the most nostalgic and homey parts of your chart, Virgo. Don’t be surprised if you’re pulling out old family albums or sharing stories with your siblings about “back in the day”. You might also be wrapping up a major home-related project, such as decorating or planting your garden. With stable Saturn, the planet of long-term planning, in a good angle any major decisions you make should be good ones: buying a house, having a baby or bringing your parents to live with you.

"
10 june 2017,virgo,"Sweet! Lucky Jupiter finally resumes direct motion after a four-month retrograde. Last fall this abundant planet entered your income sector for the first time in 13 years, a boon for pulling in more cash and saving it. However, progress may have stalled back in early February when the gas giant started moving backward in the heavens. Now that it’s back in action so should you be! You have through October 10th to hustle, so make sure that every day counts.

"
11 june 2017,virgo,"Great day for opening up and being vulnerable with the people you love. Erratic Uranus could open up the floodgates, so get ready to speak your mind. Get things off your chest before Neptune retrogrades on Friday.

"
12 june 2017,virgo,"This is one heck of a day to further your ambitions, whatever they might be, as long as you’re going things alone! Some tough planetary aspects over the next few weeks indicate that partnering with others may not be in your best interests. So—do your morning exercise routine without relying on an exercise buddy to motivate you. Think twice before taking on a business partner. Rely on your own judgment. Even if you seek the wisdom of an expert, let the final decision be your own.

"
13 june 2017,virgo,"People may be hard to pin down today courtesy of a tough Neptune-Mercury square. Watch out for obfuscation, foot dragging, excuses and “poor little me” routines. Fortunately, Mars is in your friendly eleventh house, so you probably won’t take it personally. However, if someone gets too out of hand, call them on it.

"
14 june 2017,virgo,"Division of labor: it’s a beautiful thing! This is a nice way of saying that you shouldn’t be the office workhouse or the maid at home. Today’s a good time to delegate tasks and put people (politely) on notice that you have expectations of them. Don’t expect them to like it, though. Tomorrow there could be pushback, so get ready to stand your ground.

"
15 june 2017,virgo,"With the Sun in the most ambitious part of your chart, you’re in no mood for other people slowing you down—but that may exactly what’s happening right now. A Sun-Saturn smackdown could find you setting boundaries with people who are demanding too much of your time and attention. One caveat, however: don’t become so focused on your goals that you neglect spending quality time with the people you care about.

"
16 june 2017,virgo,"Between now and late November you may wonder of you’re better off doing things by yourself, Virgo. That’s because Neptune begins to retrograde in your partnership sector, causing people to slack or be indirect with their words and behavior. This includes both personal and business relationships. Don’t get stuck doing all of the grunt work! Singles, you may feel like taking a break from the dating scene. That’s OK—pamper yourself instead!

"
17 june 2017,virgo,"Let freedom ring? The Liberty Bell may be clanging for you, Virgo, as planets in your friendly eleventh house are pushing you out the door and into some nice social situations. The only issue is that you may realize that you could use some space from a lover or other people who are close to you. There’s nothing wrong with having your own life.

18 june 2017,virgo,"This week an opportunity to make more money, either through a job or some kind of passive income investment, could come your way, and it may happen quickly. Likewise you might stumble upon a genius idea for earning more. With the Sun about to enter Cancer midweek, your smartest move is to seek the advice of a mentor or close confidante who can guide you in the right direction.

"
19 june 2017,virgo,"A power struggle could erupt as people around you are determined to get their way. Problem is, so are you! With intelligent Mercury in the most authoritative part of your chart, you shouldn’t hold back your opinion. You may be the only grown-up in the room, but that’s too bad–let the others deal with it.

"
20 june 2017,virgo,"Increasing your net worth will be on your mind today, and fortunately for you the planet of genius is in fine form. Innovative Uranus could spur your imagination to come up with a money-making idea—a patent, side business, passive income stream or just a better place to invest the money you’ve already saved. Seek advice before you plunge in; tomorrow the Sun enters your house of mentors and coaches.

"
21 june 2017,virgo,"The words “mastermind group” are tossed around a lot these days, but you would be wise to consider being a member of one. Today both the mighty Sun and intelligent Mercury enter your house of networking, making this one of the best times in years to join forces with others. Don’t feel like being part of a think tank? Then join a singles group or a local charity. Become part of a running club or the PTO. Get involved at your church or start a book club. Enjoy!

"
22 june 2017,virgo,"Your friends and acquaintances will become a much bigger part of your life in the weeks ahead, and so they should. The Sun and Mercury entered your networking zone yesterday, and the company you keep can change your circumstances dramatically. Ask your pals to play matchmaker, help you with a business idea, join you in a charitable venture, and simply get together to have some fun.

"
23 june 2017,virgo,"It’s time to get serious about what you want out of life rather than talking and thinking about it. Tomorrow’s new moon falls in your house of deeply held dreams and wishes, so get clear about them and then decide to do  something.

"
24 june 2017,virgo,"A people-centric new moon occurs today, a special time for Virgos to make social plans with their existing friends—and to make some new ones along the way. As a matter of fact, the planets are lining up in such a way that you’re encouraged to start traveling more with a lover and/or your pals. Who knows whom you might meet while on holiday?

"
25 june 2017,virgo,"First, the good news: the recent new moon in your house of dearly held dreams is kicking off a six-month phase in which you can pursue them. Now for the “pay attention” part of this message: you may end up being overwhelmed by either too may choices, or too may people providing you with their input. While it’s a wise move to seek advice right now, it’s not the time for making decisions. Slow down and take things one step at a time.

"
26 june 2017,virgo,"This is a superb week for forging new partnerships with people in all areas of your life. Whether you’re looking for love, interested in joining a volunteer group or want to create an industry mastermind meet up, it’s green lights ahead. Business partnerships are also highly favored; two (or more!) heads are better than one right now.

"
27 june 2017,virgo,"Getting on the same page with people is essential. You’re going to need their support in the months ahead, but with murky Neptune retrograde in your partnership zone, it may be hard to come to an agreement. Fortunately the next 48 hours bring aspects that will enable you to make things clear to everyone involved. You may need to push a little harder than you’d like, but if you don’t nothing will get done.

"
27 june 2016,virgo,"Got love on your mind? With the two most romantic planets in the cosmos in a perfect angle, your plans can bolt forward. We’re talking serious plans here, not the little stuff! With Mercury entering your hopes and wishes sector, and Mars going direct in your house of communication, it’s the perfect moment to share your thoughts with an amour (and that includes hot new prospects).

"
28 june 2017,virgo,"If there is absolutely one thing you need to do today, it’s to reach out and connect with someone. Better yet, connect with as many people as possible! Network your little Virgo a** off, as motivational Mars and chatty Mercury are meeting up in your house of socializing. Whether you do so to find new love, a higher paying job or just for the joy of being around like minded people, you need to develop strong ties.

"
28 june 2016,virgo,"Alone with your thoughts? The Moon is leading you into deep reflection, helping you plan the next step ahead on your path through life. As this is a positive placement, you can come to realizations that are quite powerful. But a Pluto square indicates that you may not be willing to share your ideas with your lover. Sometimes you need time to think alone.

"
29 june 2017,virgo,"On the same page? It may not feel like it as Pluto faces off against Mercury in the heavens. This could happen with a lover, a friend, a team you’re involved with (like a charity) or a group at the office. There could be a difference in values or the creative direction that you’re all heading in. The good news is that you’re diplomacy skills are high, so remain patient and wait for a better day to make progress.

"
29 june 2016,virgo,"Sometimes even the happiest of romantic relationships can hit the doldrums, but today’s planetary aspects are designed to shake you out of a funk. As the Moon conjuncts surprise-a-minute Uranus, you may experience a realization that you need something more: more excitement in love, better sex, more quality time, a different type of lover, less drama. Whatever it is, honor it–and make it happen.

"
30 june 2017,virgo,"You’re such a self starter that it may be inconceivable to you that others just can’t get their s*** together. And that’s what you’ll be dealing with over the next week–people who need to be reined in, motivated or reminded what their responsibilities are. This is just as true of your personal life as in business, so get ready to whip people into shape.

"
30 june 2016,virgo,"At cross purposes? You and a lover may not be on the same page when it comes to future plans. Don’t be driven to keep up with your friends. Just because your pals may be all heading down the aisle and having babies doesn’t mean that you need to be in a rush. Likewise, all committed relationships go through rough patches. If that’s your situation, let it pass. Neptune in retrograde can be causing confusion in romance.

"
1 july 2017,virgo,"Money matters can be discussed with greater ease, courtesy of a positive lunar aspect. Inspiration for earning more will also flow your way thanks to Neptune in a generous mood. Chances are, though, that increasing your net worth will require teaming up with someone–a business partner, a financial advisor–so consider whom you should speak with.

"
1 july 2016,virgo,"What a wonderful day in the cosmos! The two most upbeat planets in our solar system are teaming up to help us, and in your case Venus is pushing you to go after your dreams. Lucky and generous Jupiter will provide you with the courage and savoir faire to pull them off. But chances are this won’t be a solo project– a friend or acquaintance could be instrumental in your future success and happiness.

"
2 july 2017,virgo,"Sitting back and smiling while someone hands you a bunch of bulls*** is never easy….so why are you doing that? A tense Mars-Pluto opposition today may find you getting fed up with being at the receiving end of other people’s nonsense. There’s no need to explode, however–once gentle Venus enters Gemini on the 4th, you’ll be able to respond with calm authority.

"
2 july 2016,virgo,"It’s time to reassess a family or housing situation, as serious Saturn is trying to bring stability to this part of your life. You may need to scale back (temporarily, at least) some of your bigger plans, such as having another child, buying a vacation home or moving across country. This vibe reappears several times in the first two weeks of July, so expect to have some conversations with your loved ones about these topics.

"
3 july 2017,virgo,"Forgiving and forgetting what others have done is important right now, Virgo. It doesn’t really matter who’s right and who’s wrong; what counts is your peace of mind. You need a break from drama, which means that you need to simply let go.

"
3 july 2016,virgo,"If there has been confusion in a romantic matter, today the fog will clear. That’s because the fiery Sun meets up with misty Neptune in a glorious angle, helping you get a handle on matters of the heart. Even if you’re single, you will be able to sort out the kind of long lasting partnership you want in the future.

"
4 july 2017,virgo,"Sometimes pursuing our dreams feels about as pleasant as getting a root canal. And if that’s been the case for you, Virgo, good news! Easy-going Venus just glided into your house of ambition where it will stay until the 31st. It’s possible that suddenly, the right people and circumstances show up at just the right time. Synchronicity is a beautiful thing–keep your eyes open for it!

"
4 july 2016,virgo,"Ready for some fresh new faces to come into your life? Today’s new moon in your convivial house of networking means that you’re about to expand your social and business circle. With romantic Neptune active, chances are good that your love life is about to take a big leap forward. The next six months will introduce you to an exciting new group of people.

"
5 july 2017,virgo,"Now that left-brain Mercury is now in your right-brain twelfth house, it’s time to stop being so obsessed with to-do lists, budgets and efficiency. If anything now is a good time to meditate, get involved with hobbies and just relax with a good book.

"
5 july 2016,virgo,"Yesterday’s new moon in your networking sector suggests that two heads are better than one, and today is excellent for reaching out to potential partners. Hooking up with a team of like-minded people who have knowledge to share can help expand your own thinking.

"
6 july 2017,virgo,"You may think that you know the smartest way to proceed with an issue–and indeed you could be right–but that doesn’t mean that the team will be willing to go along with your ideas. A Sun-Jupiter square today means that the consensus of the group comes before the smarts of one individual. Suck it up and go along with it, at least for now.

"
6 july 2016,virgo,"Communication between you and acquaintances could be a bit bumpy over the next few days. Today is superb for talking with friends and networking with folks in social, business and charitable arenas. But tomorrow is another story, as opposing planets make things tense in the romance department. Your best bet is to tiptoe around your lover until the weekend, when sanity returns.

"
7 july 2017,virgo,"If your career, love life or big plans are no longer working for you, it’s time for some reflection. That should be easy with intelligent Mercury in the confidential house of the quiet mind. It signals sweet Venus in your ambition sector. With tomorrow’s full moon in your house of living la vida loca, don’t be surprised if you’re ready to bust out of a rut!

"
7 july 2016,virgo,"Is it time to look out for #1? Your needs and wishes are pitted against those of your friends, lovers and even groups that you’re involved in. Planetary aspects indicate that you have some pretty interesting, even lofty goals and wishes, but the people around you aren’t in agreement. Tomorrow’s aspects are better, helping you crystallize your plans. Whether your acquaintances go along for the ride is up to you.

"
8 july 2017,virgo,"If life has seemed a little dull lately, tonight’s full moon will put some sparkle back into it. That’s because it takes place in your frothy, festive sector of enjoying life. Don’t think that it’s frivolous to want to play–you deserve it.

"
8 july 2016,virgo,"If you can dream it, you can do it. That’s the message that the cosmos has for you, Virgo, and you’d be smart to run with it. Planet of luck Jupiter is active in your sign and is encouraging you to think big. Over the next few days really think about where you’d like to go next in your life, then write it down in detail. Helping you is energetic Mars in your house of intelligence and documentation.

"
9 july 2017,virgo,"Despite your desire to relate with someone, they might not be open to it. This can be true even of close friends or people you’ve known for years. There’s an undercurrent of rivalry going on, or an unwillingness to cooperate. It will ebb and flow over the next two weeks, but once the 20th rolls around, you’ll be able to put your finger on what’s going on.

"
9 july 2016,virgo,"Impressive! The cosmos is green-lighting your desire to make a positive impact on the world. A conjunction between the nurturing Moon and blessed Jupiter means that you can also learn how to take excellent care of yourself. Strong self-esteem leads to charisma.

"
10 july 2017,virgo,"Tread warily in the internet or electronic world today! A tough standoff involving the Sun and Pluto could find you going into rant mode or sending an angry e-mail to the wrong person. Mercury isn’t retrograde, but aggressive Mars is in your tech sector and is raring to pick a fight. This sector also governs friends and colleagues, so you need to be diplomatic with them as well.

"
10 july 2016,virgo,"Forging dynamic connections is what it’s all about today, Virgo! Enterprising Mars in your social sector is telling you that it’s not only what you know, but who you know. Even the shyest members of your sign will be able to open up and chat with others. Dazzling Jupiter is by your side, helping you expand your tribe and alliances.

"
11 july 2017,virgo,"You may feel as though there are daunting tasks–obstacles, even–in front of you. But a helpful Moon-Jupiter trine will enable you to break them down into manageable chunks. Jupiter is in your house of creating smart routines and stability, so reflect upon what changes you can make to become more efficient.

"
11 july 2016,virgo,"Intense emotions could erupt between you and a friend, and you might be surprised by their remarks. The same holds true for people in a team or group setting whom you’ve been working with. Considering that intelligent Mercury will be sliding into your highly intuitive twelfth house on Wednesday, you’ll be more than able to suss what’s going on behind the scenes.

"
12 july 2017,virgo,"An atmosphere of cooperation arises (at least on your part!) now that the Moon is in your diplomatic seventh house of partnering. Even if others aren’t willing to share, it’s smart to take the high road. You’ll feel proud obour how you’ve conducted yourself, and that’s a feeling that no one can take away from you.

"
12 july 2016,virgo,"Venus enters your vibey twelfth house today, a wonderful aspect for cleansing your soul and mind. Venus is the planet of ease, so releasing old baggage shouldn’t be as painful a process as it can be at other times. Take some down time to pamper and nurture yourself, relaxing in solitude as you close the door on the madding crowd. Healing, surrender, closure—this can happen if you sit with yourself. Should you need the help of a therapist, grief counselor, or even someone in the metaphysical field, by all means reach out to them.

"
13 july 2017,virgo,"One-on-one relationships or collaborations will benefit from an auspicious Moon-Neptune aspect. Neptune is the planet of dreams and letting things flow, so this is an excellent time to express your deepest thoughts and opinions to the people in your world.

"
13 july 2016,virgo,"Ground control to Major Tom! If you feel like you’re living in a fourth dimension rather than on planet Earth, you can thank Mercury for that. The planet of thinking and communicating has just entered your intuitive twelfth house, turning you into a walking radio tower. Venus is already there, and between these two your personal psychic ability should soar. Pay attention to gut hunches, as they will be especially on target over the next five weeks.

"
14 july 2017,virgo,"You can strike a nice balance between logic and intuition, so rely upon both for making decisions and going through your day. It’s important to tap into your hidden wisdom as the people around you seem to be too involved in their own personal dramas to be of much help!

"
14 july 2016,virgo,"How  you present your message today is just as important as its content. Be careful not to push too hard when communicating with others, as assertive Mars may make you come on too strong. Your emotions may get the better of you, due to no-holds-barred Uranus acting up. Combine logic with your feelings before you speak.

"
15 july 2017,virgo,"Make every effort to meet new people and socialize, because some of the people you connect with could become quite important to you over the next few months. This is true both personally and professionally. Once the Sun moves into Leo next week you may feel like withdrawing a bit, so get out there and mingle now.

"
15 july 2016,virgo,"Any kind of family or residential matter that needs to be resolved should be tackled today, Virgo. A helpful meeting between the Moon and Saturn will help you get the ball rolling. While the issue may not be taken care of by the time the Sun sets, that’s not a problem. Positive energy in the first half of next week will assist you in wrapping things up.

"
16 july 2017,virgo,"You may need to draw a fine line with your friends, as some of them may be getting too involved in your personal affairs. Whether it’s a platonic pal who seems to want more than that, or a BFF who’s butting their nose into your business, diplomatically let them know where you stand.

"
16 july 2016,virgo,"Your intuition is a s sharp as a razor, Virgo, but don’t be afraid to use it to cut through BS and concerns that have been on your mind! It’s a valuable tool to be used with care. Today it may help you figure out what’s going on in the minds and hearts of the people closest to you, like friends and lovers. A harmonious trine between Mars and the Sun allows you to get closer to them by communicating your thoughts–and intuitive hits.

"
17 july 2017,virgo,"It will be hard to determine just how committed someone is to a particular course of action, be they a lover, friend or business connection. Things can get way too emo if you push for an answer, so your best bet is to sit back and wait for a better day in the cosmos.

"
17 july 2016,virgo,"Home is where the heart is, and the planets are actively trying to bring you serenity and comfort where you live. Serious Saturn is on the case, asking you to consider the people in your life who may be “disturbing the peace”, so to speak. A full moon on Tuesday in your house of children and lovers will illuminate any problems you may be having with them. If the inmates are running the asylum, no way is Mama or Papa going to be happy. Singles, your place should be an oasis. If others are taking away from that, it’s time to take action.

"
18 july 2017,virgo,"With today’s auspicious Venus-Jupiter trine, you won’t be in the mood for anything that’s built on a shaky foundation, whether it’s a career move or a romance. With the two most beneficial planets in the solar system in your house of stability, you’re in a terrific spot to create strength and long term viability.

"
18 july 2016,virgo,"How strong is your romantic relationship? That’s the question posed by Pluto today as it meets up with the emotional Moon in your house of love. Pluto’s role is to point out weaknesses in any given situation. Considering that tomorrow’s full moon is in this part of the sky, you should be thinking long and hard about your level of happiness. The full moon will give you the opportunity to improve matters, or move on.

"
19 july 2017,virgo,"Sometimes one of the most important things we can do for ourselves is to take the time for inner work. Today is excellent for getting your thoughts and emotions out into the “open”, but in a secluded way! For instance, start a daily journal. Talk to a trusted confidante. Make an appointment with a therapist. Meditate. Do the work and reap the rewards.

"
19 july 2016,virgo,"Today’s full moon in your house of romance may serve as a wakeup call. Just how much intimacy and bonding are you enjoying? If the answer is “not enough”, then you need to have a talk with your amour. A positive Mercury-Saturn angle however, does indicate that you have a good chance to work things out.

"
20 july 2017,virgo,"Separating fiction from reality is going to be crucial over the next four weeks with so much planetary activity taking place in your house of the mind. Mars entered it today and the Sun arrives on Saturday. From people to circumstances, if it doesn’t feel authentic, it probably isn’t. Close out the past and move on.

"
20 july 2016,virgo,"You’re craving more stability and emotional security, Virgo, and today’s aspects could bring you closer to that state of contentment. Inner work is what it’s all about, as silky smooth Venus is smoothing things over from the house of your subconscious mind. Take some time to consider what habits and thought patterns you can release to make your life operate on a more even keel.

"
21 july 2017,virgo,"People may not be on the same page today, and as a result emotions could start to bubble over. Someone could even display an outburst (and that includes you), so it may be wise to avoid known divas and malcontents. Once the Sun enters Leo tomorrow you’ll get a better handle on what to do next with these folks.

"
21 july 2016,virgo,"An exercise regimen or health practice may need some tweaking today in order for you to be operating at your personal best. What needs to be changed? Be brutally honest with yourself. When the Sun enters Leo tomorrow, you’ll have four weeks in which to reach out to doctors, dietitians, physical therapists and other healers for advice and treatment.

"
22 july 2017,virgo,"You are entering into a major life changing phase, one in which you will be making important long term decisions about what (and whom) is staying in your life–and what’s not. That’s because the Sun has entered Leo, your twelfth house of closure and healing. Create your short list now, then get ready to implement it with tomorrow’s new moon.

"
22 july 2016,virgo,"Jupiter has been blessing you with its presence in your first house since last August, pushing you to initiate projects in all parts of your life, from love to health to money. It will be leaving your sign in early September, and now that the Sun is in Leo, the time is right for some serious strategizing. Spend the next four weeks figuring out your game plan for your birthday year ahead.

"
23 july 2017,virgo,"It takes a lot of energy for a caterpillar to morph into a butterfly, and a certain amount of seclusion as well. That’s the message behind today’s new moon in Leo. Pull away from the madding crowd as you take care of the important inner work that’s needed. Serenity may take time to develop, but it is so worth it.

"
23 july 2016,virgo,"Plan a special night out with your honey, as this is one of the most romantic days of the month. The passionate Moon connects with amorous Neptune, so don’t go the pizza and movie route. Neptune says to go glam or go home. No honey in sight? Then get out there and show off the goods, my friend. You never know whom you may bump into.

"
24 july 2017,virgo,"Trying to figure out a happy balance between work and your personal life could feel onerous today, but relief is in sight. Spunky Uranus could hit you with a “Eureka!” moment in which a potential solution becomes available, so pay attention.

"
24 july 2016,virgo,"Sweet relief! A productive Moon-Sun trine helps you get to the bottom of issues that may have been ruffling your emotions as of late. The Sun is in the sector that governs the deepest recesses of your psyche, and it shines its light to help you release, cleanse and move on.

"
25 july 2017,virgo,"Yassss!! Clever Mercury zips into Virgo today, helping you speak with eloquence and come up with cutting edge ideas. You’re in an excellent position to use both your intuition and logic, so rely on both over the next three weeks.

"
25 july 2016,virgo,"With Uranus scheduled to go retrograde this Friday in your house of intimacy and deep emotions, it’s wise to get in touch with your feelings now, particularly when they come to love. Get to the bottom of issues that have troubled you in the past, or those that have kept you from experiencing only the truest kind of love. Whether you’re single or attached, content or miserable, this is the starting point for a happier future.

"
26 july 2017,virgo,"Your best work will be done in private, as a Sun-Mars connection encourages you to pull away from the madding crowd. Whether you’re rewriting your resume, trying to get rid of bad habits or planning the next chapter of your life, some quiet time is in order. You’ll be able to get a heck of a lot done.

"
26 july 2016,virgo,"If you believe in karma, then you’ll enjoy today’s planetary energy. You’ve been learning a lot of lessons about love and life. A sweet Moon-Pluto-North Node triangle helps pull together a lot of the pieces. You’re learning that you don’t have to suffer; you’ve paid your dues. Now get out there and grab the brass ring.

"
27 july 2017,virgo,"Who are the “right” kind of people who should be in your life? This isn’t about being snobby; it’s about surrounding yourself with folks who allow you to be yourself and retain your dignity in the process. People should fill your soul, not deplete it.

"
27 july 2016,virgo,"Baring your soul? You could suddenly feel the urge to divulge some deep thoughts and emotions to someone close. Or, you could be at the receiving end of someone else’s sharing session. Either way, it’s a positive, cathartic event. Try to get as much out in the open as possible before Uranus goes retrograde on Friday.

"
28 july 2017,virgo,"Luck is on your side in financial matters, thanks to abundant Jupiter in your income sector. But you know the old saying, “The harder I work, the ‘luckier’ I get.” It ain’t gonna happen if you sit on your butt, so start shaking that money tree.

"
28 july 2016,virgo,"The great benefic Jupiter will remain in Virgo for just a few more weeks, so now is the time to really think about new plans. With several planets in your behind-the-scenes sector, it’s smart to take some quiet time to strategize. But with Jupiter winking at the Moon in the most expansive area of your chart, you won’t be thinking small.

"
29 july 2017,virgo,"You need to plan for the future just as much as you live for today, Virgo. The good life beckons but it has a price. Balance your present finances with your plans for tomorrow.

"
29 july 2016,virgo,"Your sex life may go from a rolling boil to a sizzling simmer instead, courtesy of Uranus going retrograde in your house of eroticism. But lest you think that a prescription for Viagra is necessary, consider this. A toned down libido will give you the opportunity to think things through. Is your relationship based just on lust? Are you sharing your thoughts and emotions with each other? Singles will become more interested in meeting a soulmate than Mr. or Ms. Right Now.

"
30 july 2017,virgo,"This is Venus’s last day in your house of ambition, so you’d be wise to wrap up any goal planning that you’ve been involved in. Fortunately Venus makes a stellar aspect with planet of genius Uranus, which can spark some last minute (and ground breaking) ideas for you to pursue. Conduct your research then move ahead.

"
30 july 2016,virgo,"Your birthday season is approaching, and the first planet to get the party started is bright little Mercury. It zips into Virgo today, stoking your brain with a number of ideas that can prove to be winners. But make sure you act on them quickly. Mercury will be in your sign for a longer time than usual but it retrogrades a month from today. Reach out to people, draw up plans, sketch ideas, make travel plans, and talk love, as well as money.

"
31 july 2017,virgo,"Life becomes a lot more social now that Venus is in your house of mingling and networking! Over the next three weeks you should make it your mission to spend as much time with others as you can, not only for the sheer joy of it, but also to make valuable new contacts. And if a particular friendship has reached its sell-by date, it may be time to move on.

"
31 july 2016,virgo,"Romance could hit a bump in the road when it appears that your needs are not being considered by your lover. Singles might be looking at their friends today, questioning why they  seem to have all the good stuff in life and you don’t. It’s that kind of a day, but let it pass. The good news: highly romantic Neptune has your back from the commitment sector.

"
1 august 2017,virgo,"Finding a balance between your social life and family responsibilities becomes easier today with a Moon-Venus aspect. Venus just entered your networking sector, so there should be no shortage of invitations coming your way. Just make time for yourself and loved ones and everyone will be happy.

"
1 august 2016,virgo,"Private issues that have been dragging on for far too long can finally be discussed. Emotions may run high, and there could be some surprising revelations. But a positive outcome is at hand if you’re willing to get in touch with your true thoughts and feelings.

"
2 august 2017,virgo,"Long term emotional stability is the name of the game as mature Saturn pushes for peace of mind. And you’d be wise to pay attention, as next week’s eclipse will help you develop good habits that will help you destress and feel like you’re on top of things.

"
2 august 2016,virgo,"“Earth to Virgo. Come in, Virgo.” Don’t be surprised if your feet aren’t planted firmly on the ground over the next few weeks. Mars has just entered your vibey twelfth house, the place of the higher mind. To say that you’re going to be intuitive is an understatement. Mars joins Saturn, which will help back up your psychic hits with logic. Beam back down when you’re ready.

"
3 august 2017,virgo,"This is no time to take risks in either love or money, as erratic Uranus retrogrades over the next five months. Slow and steady is the way to go, ensuring that you have all the facts before you take the plunge. Keep the old fable about the tortoise and the hare in mind and you’ll do fine. Think “Team Tortoise”.

"
3 august 2016,virgo,"Strategizing is key right now, Virgo. With the Sun and moon in the most confidential part of your chart, your mind will be busy with figuring out your next step. Innovative Uranus sparks some brilliant new ideas, yet stern Saturn keeps it real by reminding you that security is important. The bottom line: you develop logical plans that won’t put you at risk.

"
4 august 2017,virgo,"Following routines and maintaining stability counts for a lot with next week’s eclipse arriving in your habit-driven sixth house—so why allow anyone or anything to be a disruptive influence? A Jupiter -Pluto square brings out the drama in someone. Make sure it’s not you.

"

"
5 august 2016,virgo,"Venus enters your sign today, Virgo, and she’s going to be a busy lady over the next few weeks. The first item on her agenda is handling the expectations others have of you. Seems like some people in your circle have been needy, placing too many demands on your time and attention. Or they’re sticking their nose where it doesn’t belong. It’s time to draw a line in the sand.

"
6 august 2017,virgo,"It’s a battle between the head versus the heart as the passionate Moon can’t figure out which end is up. I’d put money on the head wining this round as a lunar eclipse on Monday falls in the most practical part of your chart.

"
6 august 2016,virgo,"An ongoing theme over the past year has been your needs versus those of the people around you. Chances are you’re getting tired of being the family peacemaker or go-to errand girl/boy. The calm one in a friendship or romance who’s always giving. The sturdy workhorse at the office. Well, this weekend’s planetary aspects may bring everything to a state of critical mass. Don’t explode–set boundaries instead.

"
7 august 2017,virgo,"Get out of Virgo’s way! A lunar eclipse in their house of organization and efficiency is going to turn them into a whirling dervish of activity. Out with slow routines, buh-bye bad habits, good bye slackers. It’s time to make your life run better than a well-oiled machine, and with motivator Mars raring to clean house (literally and figuratively) you can haul ass.

"
7 august 2016,virgo,"Your ability to dig deep and get right to the heart of a matter is strong, Virgo, thanks to intelligent Mercury in your first house. But others may not be amenable to what you have to say. Don’t expect people in your circle to agree with you and jump on board with whatever it is that you’re proposing. Neptune is clouding their vision. Wait until Wednesday, when your words will ring with clarity.

"
8 august 2016,virgo,"Mercury is retrograde in your first house, which means that although your brain may be buzzing with ideas and opinions, you could still fall prey to others’ agendas. Maverick Uranus acts up today, suggesting that a partner may be playing on your emotions. This could be in the business realm as well as romance, so stay on your toes. The fog begins to clear tomorrow.

"
9 august 2017,virgo,"Too much work and not enough play will make for one cranky Virgo. Bad boy Pluto in your fun and relaxation sector demands some down time, so book it! However, if burnout is the issue, a nice day at the spa with a massage and glass of Prosecco is advised over a wild night out on the town.

"
9 august 2016,virgo,"With planet of communication, Mercury, in your first house of goals and self-image, your words carry weight. But the problem lately is that people around you may not be listening, or they choose to stick to their own viewpoint. That’s about to change.

A fabulous aspect between outgoing Mercury in your house of self-image and powerful Pluto makes your voice the one to be heard.

A Jupiter-Uranus angle suggests that it may be time to review household expenses, or to start saving for a down payment for a home. Refinancing an existing mortgage is on the table, as is ensuring that your family will be taken care of in the future through wise investments. As for dramas? They need to go.

"
12 august 2017,virgo,"“Nobody gets me!” That may be your battle cry over the next three weeks as Mercury retrogrades in your sign. This feeling may be strongest in your romance, as Mercury opposes amorous Neptune today. It’s essential to be as logical as possible when it comes to love, as your heart may get in the way of your head. Fortunately this is over by the 31st.

"
12 august 2016,virgo,"Your emotional and financial security will be on your mind, as the planets shine their light on your home, love and financial houses. Over the past five months you may have been putting out fires within the family, trying to improve your residential situation or working hard to balance your budget.

Today’s a good time to start, as a positive Moon-Sun-Uranus angle works on your behalf.

"
14 august 2016,virgo,"Not on the same page? Venus and Neptune oppose each other in the heavens, indicating that you and a partner may not be in agreement. You have to make sure that the other person–a lover or business partner–isn’t telling you what you want to hear, however.

"
18 august 2017,virgo,"That’s what friends are for! A buddy could help you out in some way, so don’t be hesitant about asking for their assistance.

"
19 august 2017,virgo,"Sudden pangs of envy may crop up as erratic Uranus is in a touchy mood today.

"
19 august 2016,virgo,"This could be quite a delicious day for romance with the amorous Moon gliding next to Neptune. So why the reluctance on your part? The North Node is acting up, that’s why.

"
16 september 2016,virgo,"Should I stay or should I go? That’s the question as a lunar eclipse takes place in your commitment sector. If a love match has been more of a chore than a happy event, it may be time to move on. But if you’re happy, this eclipse could push your relationship to the next level: marriage, a baby, cohabitating. Singles, this eclipse could signal the end of your days of living in the desert, as full moon eclipses are known to bring things to a close. Happy hunting!

"
17 september 2016,virgo,"Holding back your feelings today won’t be easy, Virgo, but this is a positive thing!

Whatever you choose to call it, it’s calling your name thanks to a hot new moon today in your income sector. This isn’t about winning a lottery ticket but going out there and earning it. A Venus-Neptune trine occurring at the same time suggests that you don’t go it alone, but instead partner up with a savvy expert or “co-conspirator” who can help you both profit.

"
2 october 2016,virgo,"With so much planetary emphasis on your income, especially after yesterday’s new moon, no one would blame you for being fixated on the almighty dollar. As the week progresses your sense of security should increase, as Saturn is determined to show you not only the money, but a satisfied sense of financial strength.

Especially in matters involving romance or your kids, you need to keep a cool head as arguments could erupt.

"
7 october 2016,virgo,"The next two weeks could be rather moody as planets in your security-conscious second house face off against those in your emotional eighth. While the Sun and Jupiter have been operating as a tag team in recent weeks, determined to boost your income as well as your confidence, they’ve been up against Pluto and Mars. A romance may be wobbly, causing you to be on edge, or an issue with a child might be troubling you. Old fears and worries could be bubbling to the surface. Good news, however: today intelligent Mercury joins the Sun and Jupiter, helping you think rationally and calmly about what’s ahead. In addition, now is the perfect time to shop your resume or build your business.

9 october 2016,virgo,"Something could come out of left field– a remark someone makes or a thought you have–which will make you question just where you stand in matters of the heart. Single or attached, it’s time to consider what you want or need in romance. The two most dynamic planets in the solar system, Mars and Pluto, are determined to make you view yourself differently, and therefore love.

"
10 october 2016,virgo,"This week could bring the breakthrough that you’ve been waiting for when it comes to earning a whole lot mo’ money. The cash won’t fall into your lap–you’r going to have to make things happen. With the Moon in your organized sixth house today, spend some time drawing up a game plan, schedule, routine, pitch or whatever it takes to help you solidify your ideas.

"
11 october 2016,virgo,"Yowza! Virgos are looking like the next Bill Gates with a stellar meeting of Jupiter and Mercury in your income sector. If you have an idea for a business, book, patent, or screenplay, get cracking. Likewise if you’re pitching ideas, making sales calls, looking for a new job or working on an ad or social media campaign. With Mars in your house of talent, your mojo will definitely be rising.

"
12 october 2016,virgo,"You may need to be the voice of reason in a romantic or business situation in the days ahead, especially when it comes to finances and budgeting. Don’t give in to guilt trips or pressure as others may try to flex their muscles. A full moon next Sunday in your house of fiscal strength will put you on the right path for building wealth.

"
13 october 2016,virgo,"Yes, you want fun. Yes, you want love and sex and a happy relationship. And maybe you want a ring, a baby, a commitment, a vacation….the list goes on. But strong arming someone else into giving you what you want simply isn’t going to work, not this week anyway! Face it, some of life’s most important milestones happen at their own sweet time.

"
14 october 2016,virgo,"The planets warn that you need to be in charge of your financial future and not rely too much on others for your security. Today a helpful Mercury-Saturn aspect is perfect for figuring out your next step when it comes to building wealth. Intelligent Mercury is in your income sector, inspiring you to come up with money-making ideas (that aren’t half baked!).

"
15 october 2016,virgo,"Financial matters may be all over the map with four planets in a contentious mood. Make sure you’ve got a handle on your savings, checking and investment accounts as erratic Uranus may throw you a curveball. An unexpected expense could crop up. Likewise, a person may be in a demanding mood—your ex, a business partner, a lover or a creditor. Knowing your financial status inside and out will be half the battle.

"
16 october 2016,virgo,"Waiting to hear news about a money matter? You may get word soon as a full moon in your financial sector wraps up things: a court case, mortgage application, commission, bonus, inheritance or paying down a credit card. That being said, there could be an unexpected development, such as an expense you weren’t anticipating, or a better one—a job offer that comes your way on short notice. It could also be a sizzling day for romance as your libido gets a boost from the lunation! Sparks could fly with your amour—or a new hottie.

"
17 october 2016,virgo,"In the mood for love and romance? I sure hope so, because the cosmos has some goodies in store for you this week. Starting with today, in fact! A sweet trine between the passionate Moon and charismatic Pluto makes you the hottest thing on two legs. Not only that, it’s Pluto’s job to point out where you have been selling yourself short in the love department in years past. It’s time for the real deal.

"
18 october 2016,virgo,"Your emotions and sense of contentment could get a happy boost over the next few weeks as cathartic Venus has just entered the sector of  sensitivity and security. This is helpful as the recent full moon in Aries may have brought old grudges and traumas to the surface, especially in matters of the heart. Now’s a good time to talk…and to heal. With the Sun entering your communication sector this Saturday, opening up is the key to feeling more serene.

"
19 october 2016,virgo,"Confidence is sexy, and your self-assured air ought to turn a few heads this week! A rare conjunction occurs today between Mars and Pluto, the planets that govern charisma and strength. They aren’t wimpy little wallflowers, and neither will you be under their influence. Since they meet up in your house of romance, it’s time to take charge of your love life whether you’re attached or single. Mind you, with Mars present you could be a tad…aggressive, but hey, sometimes that’s needed. There is some seriously sexy mojo going on here, so take it and run with it!

"
20 october 2016,virgo,"Keep the plastic in your wallet as impulse buying could lead you down the retail therapy path today. The recent full moon was all about building a strong financial base: don’t screw things up by spending money that you may not have. Also, keep your eyes and ears open for last minute changes in a financial agreement, such as a loan or joint venture. Make sure that you understand all the terms and know what you’re getting into.

"
21 october 2016,virgo,"Are your expectations about love realistic? The same holds true for your kids—are you clear on how to raise them? With the Moon in a rather emotional spot today you may be questioning these things, especially when it comes to the long term outlook. With the recent full moon falling in your finance sector you may be concerned about having enough money as a couple or as a family. The new moon on the 30th is perfect for brainstorming money-saving and making ideas.

"
22 october 2016,virgo,"A more exciting, social time kicks off today as the fiery Sun enters your house of chatting, mingling and expressing yourself. “Self-expression” can take many forms: penning a novel, writing a blog post, taking fantastic photos, drawing, lecturing, or merely having coffee with the neighbors. In the weeks ahead you may decide to take a class, travel to a nearby city and visit the museums and other attractions, or head to a quiet bed and breakfast in the countryside. With a new moon coming in this part of the sky on the 30th, start researching your options now.

"
23 october 2016,virgo,"Time to hold a budget meeting! Get a grip on your finances, especially if you share them with a spouse or business partner. There could be way too much optimism and confusion going on, and a Jupiter-Neptune aspect today will help you cut through some of it. The early part of this week is perfect for discussing “where are we going with this relationship” topics as well. Be careful, though: Tuesday things could get tense.

"
24 october 2016,virgo,"Talk much? Now that chatty Mercury is in your house of communication, it should be far easier to get your point across. And you shouldn’t have to use strong arm tactics either. One of your best days all year for self-expression is this Thursday. Schedule job interviews or important client presentations, negotiate deals, apply to school and polish up your art portfolio.

"
25 october 2016,virgo,"Are you on the same page as others in your immediate circle? Maybe so, but today’s confusing Neptune-Venus square will make you wonder. With Venus on your house of security and contentment you definitely want to know where you stand in all of your relationships and circumstances. But Neptune swirls its mist, so beware of people telling you what they think you want to hear.

"
26 october 2016,virgo,"A strong sense of security comes from many sources: a steady job, money in the bank, being in a committed relationship and experiencing peace at home, among other things. A happy Venus-Jupiter aspect today helps you make headway when it comes to feeling more content. With a positive Sun-Mercury angle tomorrow in your communication sector, the best way to start is by opening the lines of communication.

"
27 october 2016,virgo,"Speak your truth! This is one of the best days all year to say what’s on your mind. Reach out to people you need to speak with, whether it’s a lover, family member or a potential new boss. The mighty Sun and candid Mercury meet up in your communication sector, making this a superb time to express yourself eloquently. This also refers to showcasing your ideas, art portfolio, a marketing plan, sales pitch, negotiating a contract and teaching.

"
28 october 2016,virgo,"Nothing worthwhile was ever achieved without passion, and these wise words apply to you today, Virgo. A meeting of the ardent Moon and abundant Jupiter could be just the push you need to get moving on a project that is close to your heart. The good thing is that these two are in your house of routine and planning, so you can start to pursue your ambition with a smart game plan at hand.

"
29 october 2016,virgo,"Patience is a virtue, Virgo, and today the cosmos may be testing yours, especially when it comes to romance or a family matter. You may be anxious to settle something: a dispute with a parent, selling your house, starting a family, or finding a new love to name a few examples. Erratic Uranus stirs the pot and aggressive Mars wants answers now. But mature Saturn is nearby, telling you to take the time to make wise decisions, not rash ones based on pure emotion.

"
30 october 2016,virgo,"With both the Sun and Mercury in your house of networking and communicating, you could be chatting up a storm these days. You might want to consider talking with others about partnering up on a venture while you’re at it. Today’s new moon falls in your talkative third house, and it happens to be well aspected by inspirational Neptune in the alliance sector. Create a neighborhood watch association, join the PTO, get an exercise buddy, join a singles group and consider taking on a business partner. New connections could prove to be quite stimulating!

"
31 october 2016,virgo,"It’s time to toss out old, worn out ideas and replace them with some more empowering ones. The recent new moon in your house of thinking and communicating is urging you to sharpen your mental acuity and presentation skills. The best way to do this is to find some forward thinking people, movers and shakers, and pick their brains. Find a mentor, hook up with a business partner, read a book about personal development or hire a coach. Feed your head.

"
1 november 2016,virgo,"Do you need to talk with a partner? Then do so today, as a fabulous Sun-Neptune trine not only opens up the lines of communication but clears up misunderstandings. This holds true for business alliances as well as romantic ones, by the way. From current planetary aspects it appears that the other party hasn’t always been as straightforward as you would have liked. Push for clarity now.

"
2 november 2016,virgo,"Your creativity will soar in the days ahead, courtesy of a number of inspirational planetary aspects. The Sun in Scorpio is encouraging you to make like a giant sponge and absorb all the information you can soak up, good stuff that will increase your skill level. Whether you’re a parent, student, CEO, artist or truck driver, study how other people live successfully and model their techniques.

"
3 november 2016,virgo,"Someone needs to take charge of a situation, Virgo, and that person is you. This is especially true in matters of the heart and in dealing with kids. Two terrific aspects, one today and the next one on Monday, will help put you in charge without needing to resort to tyrannical tendencies. And while you’re at it, start carving out more free time for yourself, OK? The cosmos urges more “play time” for you, whatever that means: indulging in hobbies, sports, art and culture or the company of friends.

"
4 november 2016,virgo,"A series of positive planetary aspects is encouraging you to get things out into the open, Virgo. Holding in emotions and thoughts, especially if they’re of the negative variety, won’t help you or your relationships with the people around you. Don’t be surprised if the gates open wide once you start talking as spontaneous Uranus is on the scene. Not only will you feel better, your enjoyment of life will increase dramatically.

"
5 november 2016,virgo,"An emotional breakthrough could be reached today as spontaneous Uranus in your house of deep emotions is in a helpful mood. Old, buried feelings of worthlessness, resentment and jealousy (some which may date way  back) can be brought to the surface and then promptly taken to the trash bin. Fortunately the planet of ease and comfort, Venus, is involved, so this could be a fairly painless process.

"
6 november 2016,virgo,"The cosmos is stirring up big changes for you in love this week as Pluto, planet of transformation, is quite active. You want security, soulful conversations and steamy sex (thanks to a sizzling Venus-Uranus trine), but Pluto says that if you don’t ask, you don’t get. So be vocal, Virgo–let your lover know what you need. Singles–create a short list of the qualities you want in a mate, then start hunting–and stick to it.

"
7 november 2016,virgo,"Don’t let your emotions get the better of you at the office, as events could push your buttons. The same holds true for stay-at-home parents who just want to get through their day, thank you very much, without interference from unhelpful customer service people, lines at the food store and monkey wrenches thrown into their plans. This too shall pass. Within the next 48 hours, so grin and bear it.

"
8 november 2016,virgo,"Get your financial papers organized at work and at home, as you will soon be entering into a busy period when you can make a lot of progress with budgets and building a stronger monetary base. Consider what kind of new clients you want to pursue, what projects will bring in more revenues and what expenses you can safely cut at home. Luxury-loving Venus will be entering your house of fun on Friday, but you’ll need to live la vida local on a budget.

"
9 november 2016,virgo,"Have you ever poured gasoline on a fire? Well, just in case you haven’t, a heck of a lot of energy is released. And that’s what going to happen to you, Virgo, as aggressive Mars just entered your house of organization and efficiency. You may be thinking that it’s redundant for an already productive Virgo to need more help in this department, but so it is! Over the next five weeks you’ll be on fire (no pun intended). Just watch the tendency to steamroll over co-workers, employees or service providers who aren’t anywhere near as efficient as you are. BTW: this is one of your best times in two years to start a diet and exercise program.

"
10 november 2016,virgo,"You’re about to become a heck of a lot busier thanks to Mars entering your productivity zone. But why do everything by yourself and shoulder all of the responsibility? A lunar aspect recommends that you hold other people in your orbit responsible for their share of duties at home and at work. With Venus entering your house of fun and relaxation on Friday, you deserve some down time in the midst of all the grunt work.

"
11 november 2016,virgo,"Keep your expenses under control, especially when it comes to purchasing luxury items or non-necessities. Luxe Venus enters your house of living the sweet life—entertainment, chic clothes, spa treatments—but over the next few days be practical with your purchases. Don’t worry, Virgo—you’ll be able to splurge a little next week.

"
12 november 2016,virgo,"Taking careful risks is the message behind recent planetary activity in your chart, Virgo. On the one hand you’re being encouraged to bust out of a rut and live more creatively, while other planets are trying to keep your feet on the ground. The good news? You can pull this off. With rational Saturn in your house of security you won’t be coming up with any crazy ass schemes.

"
13 november 2016,virgo,"With tomorrow’s full moon falling in your house of taking risks, you could be more than ready to start traveling down a new path. Optimistic Jupiter will help you come up with the right way to go about it. But will the people closest to you be on board? Planetary influences indicate that they may try to talk you out of your plans. Ultimately the decision is yours to make.

"
14 november 2016,virgo,"Honey, you’ve got places to go and people to meet! An amazing full moon on your house of spontaneity, travel and broadening your horizons takes place today. Mercury and Mars are well aspected to bring about changes in your career, so if you’ve been thinking about going back to school to get a degree or a specialized license, now is a good time. The same holds true for careers in the government, news media, publishing and travel industries. You could be feeling so foot-loose that you may want some independence in romance, so keep that in mind!

"
15 november 2016,virgo,"Your ever-practical sign is in true Virgo form today, with Mars and Mercury in ultra-productive mode. You’re ready to blast through projects both at home and at the office knowing that you’ll feel a lot more serene when you do. You also understand, with the Moon in your “big picture thinking” ninth house, that the faster you get through the grunt work the faster you’ll be able to pursue bigger goals—and some much deserved down time. But do the people around you get this?

"
16 november 2016,virgo,"Take charge! You may suddenly become a lot more forceful when it comes to financial matters, not to mention a close emotional relationship with someone. If you have something on your mind by all means say it. This isn’t about being nasty, but letting people know that you have certain expectations. Security is very important to you right now—don’t accept half-baked promises or vague responses.

"
17 november 2016,virgo,"Sometimes we have the luxury to just focus on our own passion projects; other times we need to set aside more time for our family and home life. This can mean setting big dreams aside for awhile as we attend to more pressing needs. Right now the cosmos is creating that kind of situation for you, but it won’t last long. Tend to the needs of your loved ones right now. When Neptune goes direct on Saturday you’ll be able to squeeze in more time for you.

"
18 november 2016,virgo,"Should I stay or should I go? A tense Neptune-Mercury aspect may find you questioning a romantic or business partnership, as you’re not sure whether it’s worth it any longer. The recent full moon has been encouraging you to take chances and has probably fired up an independent streak. Consider your options, but don’t make any rash decisions under this aspect. Your sense of security is quite important to you. Wait until next week to make your move.

"
19 november 2016,virgo,"Finally! The fog clears when it comes to romance as confusing Neptune goes direct. You can now make smart and firm decisions about not only love but business alliances and contracts that may be on offer. If you’ve been happily involved in love, then this forward movement will only add to your romance, bringing back more excitement and mystery.

"
20 november 2016,virgo,"You might experience an “aha!” moment today, especially when it comes to understanding your emotions and thoughts…which of course lead to your actions. This is a positive event as the Moon in your intuitive sector forms a terrific aspect with spontaneous Uranus. Tomorrow the Sun enters Sagittarius, which will help you release negativity even faster. This is your house of comfort and security, so expect greater serenity in the weeks ahead.

"
21 november 2016,virgo,"Everyone wants to have a sense of security in life, and you should be feeling that way more than the other signs of the zodiac. The Sun just entered the part of your chart that deals with sanctuary and guarantees, so don’t be surprised if you expect answers from other people–about a job offer, engagement ring, raise, family matter or long term business deal. Just be aware that Pluto is stirring the pot, telling you to take some chances. A calculated risk may be the ticket.

"
22 november 2016,virgo,"If you have home and family matters that need to be straightened out, this is the week to do so, Virgo. A helpful Mercury-Jupiter aspect will enable you to make progress. There could be issues with a child or lover that especially need to be addressed, as Pluto could be ratcheting up their attitude a bit too high. Thursday and Friday bring some tense aspects, and of course that’s the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. Tomorrow is a good day for holding talks, which may include laying down some new rules.

"
23 november 2016,virgo,"Major plans could be on your mind today when it comes to housing or family matters, Virgo. Planetary influences indicate that you need to hold talks with loved ones and formulate long term plans, and considering that the holiday weekend is almost here, this is a smart time to get started. Maybe you’re considering moving, or allowing a parent to live with you. Perhaps an elderly relative needs help in putting together their will, or you need to work out visitation arrangements with an ex. Start the discussions and then start making changes at the time of the new moon on the 29th.

"
24 november 2016,virgo,"You’re in an interesting spot, Virgo. Optimistic Jupiter is in your house of security for the next 10 months, urging you to push past mental boundaries that have held you back. But you may be resisting this sensation today, clinging to the old ways. Family connections may be adding to this sense, as if you have to play it safe for their sake. Don’t worry, with sober Saturn in your house of family you won’t do anything too off the wall.

"
25 november 2016,virgo,"“Passion” is a word that brings to mind a number of things: steamy sexual trysts, devotion to a worthy cause, or being focused on a skill or talent that you enjoy. And today the cosmos is igniting your passion, whatever that means to you. But the question is this: does your passion come with a price? Are you willing to give up other things (like security for example) in order to pursue your devotion? Consider the pros and cons.

"
26 november 2016,virgo,"Sweet relief! Inspirational Uranus is in a cathartic mood today, blessing you with answers to emotional questions that may have plagued you for some time. Sometimes just realizing that you don’t have to suffer is all you need to break ties to the past that no longer serve you. Onward and upward!

"
27 november 2016,virgo,"The list-loving, methodical left side of your brain is telling you to get organized thanks to the influence of Mars. Yet the Moon is stimulating the more creative right side of the brain to just chill and let things flow. Which one will win? I’d put my money on the Moon. Mars will be in this part of the sky for weeks to come; the Moon won’t. You’ll have plenty of time to blast through your chores in the weeks ahead.

"
28 november 2016,virgo,"Matters of the heart could be a bit funky this week due to a Venus-Uranus square. Make sure that you’re not getting blinded by lust or good sex. Likewise, if you’re on the market for a new amour, there needs to be some substance behind someone’s charismatic exterior. With a lot of planetary activity going on in your domestic sector, you don’t want to be playing house with someone who’s not a serious contender.

"
29 november 2016,virgo,"No one can push our buttons like family, and if anyone in your family unit has been acting up it’s time to put an end to it. A positive new moon today in your domestic sector will give you the opportunity to talk things over and to start anew. Kids (and maybe your lover too) need to understand that money doesn’t grow on trees, and that everyone is responsible for getting chores done. If you’re looking for ways to bank more cash for a down payment on a house, or to redecorate, the aspects are excellent for lining up new income streams.

"
30 november 2016,virgo,"Family members may need a ration of whoop ass under today’s planetary influences. You can’t do it all, and why should you? If others are taking advantage of your time, generosity and patience, let them know that you have your limits. The same holds true for slacker co-workers. There’s no need to yell or scream—a quiet, stern look can work wonders.

"
1 december 2016,virgo,"Your attention to detail and desire to be efficient can pay off handsomely, Virgo! Now that Mars is tearing a path through your house of productivity and organization you’re ready to make progress. And with profitable Jupiter in such a terrific angle, the grunt work that you plow through will actually lead to earning more. Time is money, and the more streamlined your home and office are, the more cash you’ll have in your pocket.

"
2 december 2016,virgo,"Oh, yeah! Candid Mercury joins love planet Venus in your house of romance and fun today, quite a juicy aspect. Some of the holiday shopping and house cleaning can wait as you put yourself out there on the love market. The next few weeks are also perfect for parties, attending concerts, hitting the art galleries and shopping—for you.  Mani/pedis, massages, brunches with the girls—it’s time to play Santa for yourself. Have fun.

"
3 december 2016,virgo,"With energetic Mars in your house of fitness and health, your motivation to look and feel better can skyrocket. Today’s planetary energy encourages you to jump start your new regimen at home by clearing out the kitchen cabinets of junk foods and sugary sodas. With disciplined Saturn in your domestic sector, one of the best ways to ensure that you stick to your plan is to work out at home rather than at a gym. This includes heading out the front door for a jog; you don’t need an expensive treadmill in the basement.

"
4 december 2016,virgo,"Slow down and smell the roses. Or the coffee, pancakes and bacon! With high energy Mars now in your house of efficiency, chances are you’ve been moving fast–way too fast. While it’s nice to blast through your to-do list, you need some down time, and today the Moon demands it. Brunch, anyone?

"
5 december 2016,virgo,"Motivation may strike you to take an in depth look at your finances, searching for ways you’re wasting money or not getting enough bang for your buck. Search for better rates on your credit cards, try to lower your mortgage payments, and get rid of expenses for things that you’re really not using–the gym membership, apps or monthly membership fees for a service. It’s time to feng shui your finances, and a penny saved is a penny earned.

"
6 december 2016,virgo,"With dynamic Mars in your house of getting things done, you’re at risk of burning yourself out from overwork. Fortunately take-it-easy Venus enters this sector tomorrow, helping you make progress with less stress. A sparkling aspect with Uranus today indicates that someone may step forward and volunteer to work with you on some kind of a joint venture. The chances of it succeeding are high, so consider all offers seriously.

"
7 december 2016,virgo,"Whistle while you work! Take-it-easy Venus glides into your house of efficiency today, joining megawatt Mars. If you’ve been blasting through your chores and work flow at 120 miles per hour, now things can slow down a bit. Don’t worry, you’ll still get things done. The stress level will drop and people around you may actually become more cooperative.

"
8 december 2016,virgo,"Keep a close eye on household and business expenses as erratic Uranus could throw you a curveball if you’re not careful. This is actually a beneficial situation, even though at first glance it may not seem that way. The attention paid now to your finances can result in big benefits down the road as abundant Jupiter has your back.

"
9 december 2016,virgo,"You’re an organized soul by nature, which makes today’s super productive Sun-Jupiter meeting perfect for pulling things together. Lucky Jupiter is in your income sector, and next week’s full moon falls in your career house. The cosmos’s message? Get your act together now in order to take advantage of the upcoming opportunities to earn more and take on greater responsibility.

"
10 december 2016,virgo,"Domestic matters dragging you down? If that’s the case, put an end to them today. Serious Saturn has your back along with the authoritative Sun. Jackass roommates, nosy relatives, unresponsive landlords, exes who can’t follow a custody agreement, repair men or contractors who can’t show up on time—draw a line in the sand. If they cross it, they’re crossing you. And with next week’s full moon in the most authoritative part of your chart, they’ll be sorry that they did.

"
11 december 2016,virgo,"The full moon next Tuesday occurs in your career sector, and it’s a game changer. You may decide to leave your current field and move to a completely new one, or leave a company that you’ve been with for a long time. Today the Moon sparks up an important conversation with Pluto, asking if you’re playing things a little too safe when it comes to your occupation. With Pluto in your house of skills, consider if you need to develop a new set in order to move on to a higher, more satisfying level.

"
12 december 2016,virgo,"Break out the incense and crystals! A sudden desire to cleanse your psyche of things that have been bothering you may arise. By all means run with it, as the Sun is in your house of comfort and family ties. Enlightenment can take years, but sometimes it occurs rapidly. Now is a time when positive change can occur with lightning speed.

"
13 december 2016,virgo,"Ready for more responsibility and the cash that should come with it? If so, today’s full moon in Gemini should help you nail down a new position. If you’ve been hunting for a job for some time, good news may be coming your way. Entrepreneurial types could be putting the finishing touches on their enterprise, although with Mercury retrograding in your creative sector next week, you may want to revisit the more innovative parts of your company’s line. Creatives would also be wise to put the finishing touches on their portfolios, but if you’re not completely ready to show it off, use the next few weeks to review everything.

"
14 december 2016,virgo,"You’re becoming more determined to go after things that mean a lot to you, but do others support you? Actually, you may not even care with today’s Jupiter-Uranus opposition. If someone decides to get in your face about the path you plan to take, there’s no point in defending yourself. That being said, with the Sun about to enter your partnership zone, you may need to make a few concessions. Just a few.

"
15 december 2016,virgo,"Keep a close eye on your wallet and your emotions today as some tense cosmic angles indicate that money matters may erupt. It could be an unexpected expense or a disagreement about a lover’s spending. Maybe the green-eyed monster has taken over as you lust for expensive swag that you see on a blog or on a friend’s Instagram page. Think before you splurge.

"
17 december 2016,virgo,"Setting boundaries with others may not always be easy, but from the looks of your chart it appears to be necessary. Stern Saturn demands that you have more peace of mind, and if that requires laying down the law, so be it. You may end up being pleasantly surprised at how relaxed you feel right away. Has this been eating away at you for some time?

"
18 december 2016,virgo,"Energetic Mars has been barreling through your house of efficiency in recent weeks, and chances are you’re fried. Today the cosmos tells you to put up your feet and relax a bit. You’re going to need some energy, babe. Tomorrow the red planet moves into your house of serious commitment, so make sure that you’re refreshed for some hot blooded amour!

"
19 december 2016,virgo,"Romantic liaisons could face a bumpy ride over the next three weeks! Assertive Mars barrels into your commitment sector today, firing up the urge to merge. But Mercury retrogrades in the romance sector, warning you to slow down before you make any major decisions: getting engaged, moving in together, having a baby or taking the next big step. Singles, you could meet a serious contender but don’t start picking out baby names after the first date. Couples need to put old issues and dramas to rest, once and for all.

"
20 december 2016,virgo,"Romantic liaisons can take a big leap forward now that energetic Mars is in your house of commitment. Better yet is that the Sun enters the highly romantic fifth house on Wednesday, making the next four weeks one of your best times in years to enjoy all the goodies that come with a love relationship. Singles, you’re not left out of this conversation! Your aspects for meeting someone new are excellent; just make sure that you vet them thoroughly before announcing to the world that this is The One.

"
21 december 2016,virgo,"Love relationships are going through an interesting, flirty little dance these days. The “just dating” crowd may be getting more serious, attached Virgos are ready for more romantic quality time alone, and singles are poised to meet someone new. The week after Christmas is packed with lovely aspects that will put a smile on your face. Forget about work and chores for awhile and just think about love.

"
22 december 2016,virgo,"Your desire to bust out of financial constraints is increasing, Virgo, but which is the best path to take? That will be the question over the next week or so, and it’s wise to be reflecting upon this as the new year approaches. You can make a lot of headway but it may involve a risk. Are you ready to take one?

"
23 december 2016,virgo,"Words can flow much easier than usual today when it comes to communicating with a loved one or business partner. As a matter of fact, the entire week after Christmas is full of days with the same positive aspects, so don’t think that you have to get everything out in the open right now. The new moon on the 29th is wonderful for opening up a fresh chapter, especially with your lover and kids.

"
24 december 2016,virgo,"A romance could make a sudden U-turn today, but in a positive way! It’s time to shake up your love life with a juicy new chapter, so think about what you could do to liven things up. Singles, a soulful new amour could be on the horizon so keep watch. The new moon on the 29th is a banner time for opening up new chapters in love.

"
25 december 2016,virgo,"Ever the organized creature, you’re already thinking about what you’d like to get rolling in 2017. That’s because Venus is quite active today in your house of strategizing, paying no attention to the fact that it’s a holiday. But as you make your plans, consider how you can add more spice and creativity into your life. The new moon on the 29th falls in your house of artistic flair, so go bold!

"
26 december 2016,virgo,"Quitting the day job in order to follow your bliss may be on your mind today as an unusual Jupiter-Uranus aspect asks you to examine your career path. You could also be questioning which way to go in a romance–staying in an existing relationship (which may not be very rewarding) or seeking a soulmate who thrills you to the core. No need to make a decision today: Thursday brings two aspects that will help point you in the right direction.

"
28 december 2016,virgo,"Buddha said that enlightenment is the “end of suffering”, and that’s a wise piece of advice for everyone. You weren’t put on this planet to be like Oliver Twist with his bowl in hand, begging for “More, sir!” Hell no! Some enlightening aspects today encourage you to start living a more passionate life, one that you design. Resolve to make 2017 the year that you are good to yourself.

"
29 december 2016,virgo,"If your love life has been somewhat on the dull side, that’s about to change! Today’s new moon in Capricorn ushers in a highly romantic phase. Past problems such as jealousy and resentment should start to fade as you are able to communicate with a lover more openly. Singles, the next six months could bring in someone new so keep your eyes peeled. All Virgos should be entering a period of more intimacy and soulful connections.

"
30 december 2016,virgo,"Time to schedule a play date only for grown-ups! With the Sun in the friskiest part of your chart in fine form today, why don’t you plan a special outing just for you and your closest connections? Better yet, plan a number of them for 2017. With Neptune in your money house you can come up with budget friendly options that won’t break the bank.

"
31 december 2016,virgo,"If saving up money to buy a home (or to remodel one) is on your list of resolutions for 2017, you’re in luck. Several positive aspects are working in your favor thanks to the planet of discipline, Saturn, in an active mood. This is your best year in over a decade to earn more and sock money away, so consider what you can do to increase your pay over the next 12 months.

"
1 january 2017,libra,"Practicality rules your resolution setting sessions! Several planets in your house of streamlining and organizing will help you get 2017 off to a busy and sensible start. If you’re interested in developing a buff body, this is your year, as super motivator Mars is in your house of fitness. Just don’t go crazy with over-the-top boot camp regimens or lettuce-only diets, a possibility under the current aspects.

"
2 january 2017,libra,"You have a lot of good things coming your way this year, Libra, but you shouldn’t be shouldering the burden of all of the work! Today’s a good time to let others around you know that they have to pick up some of the slack. You’re in the mood to cut through your tasks like a hot knife through butter, but if you try to take on too much yourself, you’ll be burned out before January is over.

"
3 january 2017,libra,"Work that body, Libra. Get-gorgeous Venus is now in your house of vitality and fitness, making it easier than ever to get in shape. Start eating healthier foods, do a detox or cleanse, take vitamins, resolve to get more sleep and kick off an exercise regimen. With disciplined Saturn in your house of socializing, one of the best ways to achieve your goals is to work out with a fitness buddy, someone who’ll keep you accountable.

"
4 january 2017,libra,"Diplomacy is the name of the game between now and the 12th as Mercury retrogrades into your communications sector! Actually this can be a positive situation as personal matters that were bubbling before the holidays can be discussed and resolved. It’s also a good time to review any term papers or dissertations that are due (not to mention getting ready for final exams), a manuscript, marketing plan or blog post. The full moon on the 12th falls in your career sector, so make sure that presentations and resumes are spit and polished.

"
5 january 2017,libra,"Cat got your tongue? It wouldn’t be surprising considering that chatty Mercury is retrograde in your verbal third house. And with a number of planetary aspects making you quite emotional about family and romance matters, this could be an up and down day. Don’t expect this to change overnight though—as the weekend gets nearer, your feelings could bubble up to the surface even more. This is a necessary catharsis, however, and when Mercury resumes direct motion on the 8th you’ll be able to discuss things with the people who matter most.

"
6 january 2017,libra,"Yes, Mercury is  retrograde in your communication sector, but today the emotional Moon forms a sparkling aspect to it from your relationship zone. This means that you can make some worthy attempts to hash things out with a lover. No problems in your love life? Then God bless you, my child! Take this super opportunity to enjoy dinner in a cozy cafe where the two of you can really talk—no texting allowed!

"
7 january 2017,libra,"Some major transitions are on the horizon in your personal life as metamorphic Pluto meets up with the Sun. Your living arrangements could change as you may decide to transfer to another city or state or buy a new home. Maybe you and a lover move in together, or make plans to start a family. It could be an emotional time as family matters are front and center.With Mercury going direct tomorrow in your communication sector, this is the perfect time to straighten out family squabbles.

"
8 january 2017,libra,"OK Libra, you can pull that sock out of your mouth now. Mercury has just gone direct in your communication sector. Not only will you be able to communicate with your loved ones more eloquently, but this should help your career too. The full moon this Thursday in your house of ambition and success is one of your best times in 2017 to make progress in finding a new job or higher levels of responsibility. Start the self-promotion right now.

"
9 january 2017,libra,"As much as you would like to move forward with a particular situation, it appears that you’re getting ahead of yourself. The full moon that arrives on Thursday is in your house of ambition, and you may already be feeling its pull. The issue at hand is that things are not quite ready yet for forward movement, at least not this week. The second half of January is a far better time for developing momentum.

"
11 january 2017,libra,"Sometimes you need to choose your words carefully and tiptoe around people; other times you just need to lay it on the line for them. And the cosmos is suggesting that you take the latter route. Your sign is known for its diplomatic approach, but with Mars in your uber-practical sixth house, be as frank as possible. Tomorrow’s full  moon helps you step into a place of more authority.

"
12 january 2017,libra,"Got ambition? Then you’re going to be rewarded for it, courtesy if today’s full moon in the sector that governs success and goals. It could be a big win in your career or any other aspiration that you’ve been steadily working on. As full moons bring things to a close, you may decide to walk away from a job that doesn’t suit you and start searching for a better gig. The only fly in the ointment is that someone close may not support your plans, and this could come as a surprise. Next week is a better time to discuss matters and reach an agreement.

"
13 january 2017,libra,"Get down to business! There’s a strong push from the cosmos for you to tie up loose ends and start moving forward. Yesterday’s full moon was all about your big ambitions for 2017. For now, just worry about what you can do to make things happen and forget about the cooperation or approval of others. It’s your show, Libra. Be the star.

"
14 january 2017,libra,"Is it time to move on with your career? The recent full moon fell in that part of your chart, but it seems that you may be reluctant to make a change. A Venus-Neptune aspect could be encouraging you to take the “better the devil I know than the devil I don’t” viewpoint. Listen, if a job sucks the possibility exists that a better option exists. You won’t know unless you take some action.

"
15 january 2017,libra,"Try not to get carried away with fears and worries about your closest relationships and what’s going on at the office. The emotional Moon is stirring up your your subconscious mind and it’s responding by dreaming up imaginary scenarios that probably won’t come to pass. Focus on reality this week, not what your gut is telling you, because your intuition is off kilter.

"
16 january 2017,libra,"The planets warn that you have been pushing yourself too hard lately and unless you want to burn out, you need to some time for rest and relaxation. Like today and tomorrow. Charge up those batteries, Libra, because the Sun will be entering the most fun-filled part of your chart on Thursday. Then your focus will turn to love, getting out and enjoying the world, sports, hobbies and spending quality time with the people you love.

"
17 january 2017,libra,"Loved ones could be hard to figure out over the next few days, as the Sun is forming some tense angles to Jupiter in your sign. Don’t be baffled by bulls*** or confused by mixed signals. Wait until Thursday to proceed, as the full moon will take place in your house of authority and Mercury will be in a better spot to help you communicate.

"
18 january 2017,libra,"You’re in danger of becoming swamped by details, with your brain buzzing along like a hyperactive bee hive. Dynamic Mars is pushing you to get down to the nitty gritty and get things done, which is a good thing, but Jupiter may be making you overly optimistic as to what you can achieve in 24 hours! Today, consider streamlining your errands and protocols. Being busy all the time is not the same as being efficient.

"
19 january 2017,libra,"Here’s the good news: energetic Mars is in your house of getting things done. No procrastination for you, Libra! Now for the downside: the red planet is pushing too hard. In your race to achieve your goals—lose weight, find a new job, get engaged—you may be overlooking key details or problems that need to be addressed first. Thought needs to be given to what it is that you’re trying to achieve. If you don’t slow down and consider your actions, you’ll just be like a hamster on a wheel.

"
20 january 2017,libra,"An important new chapter is about to begin in romance now that El Sol is in your house of love. You’re in a practical mood too, not interested in flings or players. Make sure that you have healthy boundaries in place in an existing relationship; if you don’t, establish them before the new moon on the 27th. Singles, you need to set boundaries in advance by creating a short list of qualities you want in a mate and the behavior that you’re willing to accept—or not. Ask and you shall receive.

"
21 january 2017,libra,"Building self-confidence can be a “one step forward, two steps back” kind of a situation. This weekend the Moon is in your house of self-esteem, forming a healing aspect with Chiron which is all about karma. The message from the cosmos is that you deserve to be happy, and with transformative Pluto by your side, major changes can happen. The 29th is a superb day for a breakthrough.

"
22 january 2017,libra,"It’s the perfect day to toss your errands and to-do list to the side and to just go on a ramble in your town, or take a quick trip to a nearby city to soak up the culture. The Sun is in your house of enjoying life, which includes sports, entertainment, dining out, going to museums, checking out a street fair or indulging in hobbies. Carpe diem–seize the day!

"
23 january 2017,libra,"Say what you mean and mean what you say. There’s no room for mixed signals under today’s planetary influences, at least where you’re concerned. Rational Saturn is allowing you to think clearly and express yourself with purpose. Avoid the temptation to bluster, flatter or cut corners with any projects that you may be working on. Likewise, keep your BS meter turned up all the way as people around you may be dishing it out.

"
24 january 2017,libra,"If you’ve been considering a home decorating project, Libra, today’s the day to get started. Whether it requires major demolition and putting up new walls and electric, or just buying some new linens for the bedroom, it’s time to feather the nest. Planet of abundance, Jupiter, is now in your house of home and comfort through October. This is your best year in over a decade to turn your house or apartment into a castle. And while you’re at it, clean out those junk drawers. Neptune demands it.

"
25 january 2017,libra,"You’ll be able to see through someone else’s bluster, a helpful situation as you need to get things done—and so do they. But is it wise to point out their ego or slacker ways? Tomorrow is a better day for that. For now, seize the initiative and just carry on. You may need to lay down the law with people in the weeks ahead, as Friday’s new moon tells you that you don’t have to be the work horse.

"
26 january 2017,libra,"Sometimes you need to take a timeout just to analyze your routines and methods, and the cosmos wants you to do just that today. This is especially important in your career, as the two profits planets—Venus and Jupiter—are the orbs that are recommending this reflection. Obviously you can only control your own habits, and not those of other people you may need to work with. To thine own self be true.

"
27 january 2017,libra,"Sweet! Tonight’s new moon in Aquarius is all about luscious love, Libra. Whether you’re single or attached a sizzling six-month chapter opens in which you can enjoy the company of a lover, not to mention indulge in hobbies and cultural events. It should be a highly social time so you’re urged to get out of the house, alone or as a couple. Domestic matters may crop up too, such as deciding to move in together, buy a place or start a family. Just make sure that you’re not doing all of the grunt work in a relationship, like the cooking, cleaning and rear end wiping.

"
28 january 2017,libra,"Well aren’t you in a sweet spot, Libra! Yesterday’s Aquarian new moon fell in your house of romance—finding new love, juicing up the relationship you’re in now, enjoying life more—and today lusty Mars enters your house of commitment. If you’re in the market for a serious romance luck is on your side. February is looking like a terrific month for amour, so indulge. Creatives, these aspects are stellar for you as your talent is getting recognized by decision makers. The next few weeks are a smart time to retain an agent or gallery to represent you.

"
29 january 2017,libra,"Setting boundaries with family members, roommates or even people who work in your home (contractors, nannies) may be necessary, Libra. You can’t do everything by yourself, nor should you. You need emotional support and the free time to get your own stuff done. When Jupiter retrogrades in your sign on February 6th, you could end up pulling away from some of this nonsense.

"
30 january 2017,libra,"Heaven knows that most of us need to get inspired to do something about cluttered closets and desks piled high with papers, and today the cosmos is encouraging Libras to get their acts together. Start with your home base as Mercury and Pluto are demanding that your home environment runs as smooth as silk. Don’t worry, you’ll still have some fun this week. The Sun is in your frisky house of flirting, partying and living the luxe life until February 18th.

"
31 january 2017,libra,"Distancing yourself from others, no matter how much you love them, is a smart thing to do from time to time, for no other reason than to recharge your batteries. It can also help you gain much needed perspective about the direction your alliance is heading in. The cosmos encourages you to nurture yourself, which may include not giving in to someone else’s demands. Take a day off just for you.

"
1 february 2017,libra,"You’re about to enter a highly reflective time in which you’ll be questioning all that’s important to you, Libra. Jupiter will retrograde in your sign on the 6th, encouraging you to examine your priorities and connections. Today a tense lunar aspect might create a drama or disagreement with a partner, which could get this reflection started. Just know that love planet Venus will start helping you work out romantic issues as of this Friday.

"
2 february 2017,libra,"Being selfless for love is fine in the movies and in romance novels, but in real life you could be asking yourself what the hell you’re thinking. It’s time to pay attention to the role you may be playing–as a lover, as a parent or a spouse. Is it your karma to be the one who’s doing all of the “heavy lifting” in a connection? No, it’s not, and the cosmos is pushing you to take care of your own needs (just as well as you take care of others).

"
3 february 2017,libra,"Lucky Libra! Venus enters your commitment zone today, just in time for Valentine’s Day. This house governs business partnerships as well as romantic ones, so over the next four weeks you can make strides both in love and your career. But with Jupiter about to retrograde on Monday in your house of self, are you 100% in? An independent streak is rising.

"
5 february 2017,libra,"Bitten off more than you can chew? That may be the case with a tense Moon-Neptune square. Don’t kid yourself, Libra. There are only 24 hours in a day. When Jupiter retrogrades tomorrow in your sign you’ll have the next four months to pick and choose among the various options open to you. It may be time to pare back on some of your less exciting activities.

"
6 february 2017,libra,"Hmmm…should I or shouldn’t I? You may hesitate more than usual before plunging in to new opportunities now that mighty Jupiter has begun to spin backward in Libra. This includes everything from romance to surgery to getting a pet! Jupiter is a philosophical planet, and when it retrogrades it causes intense reflection. Which is smart, because between now and early June you can take your time and make more informed decisions. People around you may get twitchy because you won’t be as quick to collaborate, but that’s their problem! Besides, you’re not entering a monastery—you’re just being more discerning, that’s all.

"
7 february 2017,libra,"A new level of closeness can be reached with the people you hold near and dear, Libra! Mercury is now in your social, fun-loving fifth house. You certainly can be more spontaneous, perhaps even dramatic. But with mighty Jupiter retrograding in your sign, you will be maintaining boundaries too, a smart move. Just because you’re open and expressive doesn’t mean that others should be able to walk all over you.

"
8 february 2017,libra,"Someone in your surroundings could act out, and your initial response may be to fight fire with fire. The emotional Moon in the most authoritative part of your chart might create a “who the hell do you think you are?” kind of attitude on your part. The cosmos advises that you let this go. On Friday a helpful Jupiter-Saturn aspect will help you set things straight.

"
9 february 2017,libra,"Creative juices flow as surprise-a-minute Uranus sparks some fresh ideas in that head of yours. But two heads are better than one in this case, so share the wealth with someone who’s simpatico. Teamwork will be a big part of your life over the next six months as Friday’s lunar eclipse occurs in this part of your chart. You’ll be able to accomplish more with others than on your own.

"
10 february 2017,libra,"Your closest connections are about to undergo a major overhaul, thanks to a sparkling eclipse in Leo. Feeling lonely? This lunation occurs in the sector that governs making friends and enjoying their company, so expect some new faces to enter your life. Even if you’re quite social and have a devoted tribe, you will still make connections. Networking is what it’s all about, whether you’re looking for a new job, a potential spouse or you want to give back to the community. The people you know could end up introducing you to influential people, so don’t sit at home in front of the TV over the next few months.

"
11 february 2017,libra,"A happy development could arise in your life over the next few days, and it could be something as simple as enjoying a fresh new attitude. Today a meeting between the two  most optimistic orbs, Jupiter and the Sun, does wonders for your self-esteem. A burst of creativity, the desire to relax and play and feeling more affectionate are all in the stars.

"
12 february 2017,libra,"It will be hard to discern fact from fiction today Libra, so don’t even try. The Moon is in your highly intuitive twelfth house, which is usually a bonus, but today it opposes deceptive Neptune. Obviously you should’t make any major decisions under this aspect. Wait until Saturday if you can, when the Sun enters your practicality sector.

"
13 february 2017,libra,"From your chart it appears that you need to get issues out on the table with someone close. However, the Moon in the most secluded part of your chart may be making you reluctant to say your piece. Perhaps you feel as though you don’t have enough information to proceed and you’re counting on your intuition to give you the scoop. That’s OK. By tomorrow you’ll feel bolder and more in charge about speaking your mind.

"
14 february 2017,libra,"If there was ever a time to let your lover know just how you feel, it’s today, Libra! Saturn in your expressive third house is encouraging you to spill. Singles, with the Moon and Jupiter in your sign, your self-confidence and charisma should be going through the roof. However, you may end up having so much fun flirting that you decide to “share the wealth”. Who needs to be tied down?!

"
15 february 2017,libra,"Try to keep drama to a minimum in partnership, be it romantic or personal. A tense Moon-Mars opposition could stir up emotions, especially if you’ve been overly optimistic about the direction an alliance is heading in. This doesn’t mean that the union will fall apart, but that you need to slow down and be realistic.

"
16 february 2017,libra,"Creatively speaking, you’re on a hot streak, Libra. Mercury is stirring up your brain to come up with inventive ways of handling problems and making things happen. As a result, don’t dismiss an idea as being outlandish or impractical. You could actually be on to something.

"
17 february 2017,libra,"Stuck in a creative quagmire? The right words may not come today; brilliant ideas might not flow. Fortunately it’s a temporary blip on the cosmic radar and will ease up on Monday. However, the planets are  advising that you develop more structure when it comes to brainstorming. For example, set aside 30 minutes each day to draw, write, meditate or get the creative juices flowing.

"
18 february 2017,libra,"Finally ready to shed those pounds and get fit? The mighty Sun enters your fitness zone today for four weeks, which it does every year at this time. But what makes this season different is the solar eclipse that will occur on the 26th, the last in a series that has been going on since 2015. If you’ve already been taking good care of your health and physique, this could be the last final push that you need. But if you’re overweight and can’t touch your toes, this lunation should light a fire under you to work that body.

"
19 february 2017,libra,"You’re entering a very practical phase now that the Sun is in Pisces, and your attention to detail will count for a lot. This isn’t just at the workplace–your personal appearance and close relationships could also benefit from a strong focus to the little things. Today and tomorrow are good for examining what’s going on with your lover, and kids too.

"
20 february 2017,libra,"Just how willing are you to be a team player? From your chart it seems that you could be more interested in just having fun and flirting these days. There’s nothing wrong with that, Libra–you’re currently going through an independent streak with Jupiter retrograde in your sign. If someone tries to hem you in, they could be in for a big surprise.

"
21 february 2017,libra,"Playfulness, feeling carefree, enjoying life–these are all on the cosmic menu today with a happy Mercury-Jupiter trine. The planets are encouraging you to live for yourself a little bit more, a wise piece of advice. Keep it in mind tomorrow as a tough aspect could remind you that you don’t have to kowtow to the people in your personal life.

"
22 february 2017,libra,"We all have emotional baggage; some people seem determined to hold on to it more than others. The cosmos is telling you to let go, which may not be easy as subterranean Pluto is stirring up memories of past dramas. The question is this–do you really want to let the garbage from the past put a damper on current or future relationships with others? It’s your choice, Libra.

"
23 february 2017,libra,"Your ideas, talents and personality will be in the spotlight, so make sure that you shine! Long term Saturn is on your side, helping you forge connections (which includes love) that will stand the test of time. Don’t be shy about expressing your opinions or showcasing plans that mean a lot to you.

"
24 february 2017,libra,"An interesting mix of flirty romance and down-to-Earth practicality is in the air, Libra. This is a good weekend to pursue matters of the heart while you tackle the less glamorous aspects of your life, such as errands. You’ll need to schedule in more time for fun and amour in the weeks ahead as you’re about to enter a more businesslike, constructive phase.

"
25 february 2017,libra,"If people around you aren’t carrying their fair share of the load, it’s time to make some noise about it. This goes for your home environment as well as work. Now that chatty Mercury is in your sixth house of getting things done, you can (politely) demand that they stop their slacker ways. However, tomorrow’s solar eclipse in the same sector may push you beyond your usually generous and diplomatic limits.

"
26 february 2017,libra,"The Pisces solar eclipse kicks open a new six-month phase in which you’ll be hell bent on getting organized and productive. But unless everyone around you is also a Libra, you may face some resistance, particularly from a spouse, lover or business partner. Hey, you weren’t put on this Earth to be a domestic goddess or the office grunt work god. Put others on notice that you expect them to pull their own weight.

"
27 february 2017,libra,"It’s important to keep a clear and open mind about relationships, Libra. Optimistic Jupiter is at loggerheads today with lusty and assertive Mars, which could make you do something foolish. Like: pick an argument; race into a relationship with someone who’s wrong for you; decide to cut ties prematurely; or become jealous or fearful. Don’t make any major decisions until these two have moved on in their orbits.

"
28 february 2017,libra,"A series of planetary aspects over the past few days has been pitting your needs against those of others around you, and today you just might be so tired of it that you’ll be tempted to give in. The problem is that once they know you’re willing to wave the white flag, they’ll try to take advantage of you again. Not happening. Stand your ground.

"
1 march 2017,libra,"Everyone says that they want to be organized and lead a less stressful life as a result, but not everyone takes action. You, however, are being pushed by the cosmos to swing into action. An inspirational Sun-Neptune meeting will not only motivate you into knocking things off your to-do list, but to beautify your work environment as well. Whether you go mid-century modern, shabby chic or feng shui, make your work space as beautiful as it is functional.

"
2 march 2017,libra,"Ever since Jupiter entered your sign last fall, your desire to live your life your  way has been increasing—and today things may reach critical mass. An intense Jupiter-Uranus opposition could find you getting ready to walk away from people and situations that aren’t honoring who you really are. When Venus retrogrades on Saturday, this feeling will intensify. Between now and April 2nd you may be making some big decisions.

"
3 march 2017,libra,"How to bring passion back into your life is the question the cosmos poses to you today, Libra. “Passion” doesn’t mean just love and lust—it can also refer to the joy you bring (or don’t!) to your work and hobbies. You’ve recently had some difficult aspects in the relationship department, so you may want to start there first. If a business or romantic alliance has lost its luster, is there a way to revive it? Or is it time to move on?

"
4 march 2017,libra,"Are you in, or are you out? Love planet Venus retrogrades in your commitment sector, possibly shaking up your plans for the future. You may decide to hold off on getting married, moving in with someone or starting a family. While the retrograde period lasts until April 2nd, relief arrives on March 13th as diplomatic Mercury enters the same part of your chart. Reluctance may also arise when it comes to a business alliance. Next week is a good time to work out issues before you end up making a major decision.

"
5 march 2017,libra,"Set the record straight, Libra. Mature Saturn tells you to be forthright with the people closest to you. This is no time for concealing your feelings or opinions, nor playing passive-aggressive games. If you need to revisit the past do so, if only to create a better future.

"
6 march 2017,libra,"Focus on practical details and the fastest way to get things done, Libra. A potent conjunction of the Sun and Mercury in the most efficient part of your chart will help you strategize. Declutter, streamline and bring order to your life both at home and at work.

"
7 march 2017,libra,"The planets are pulling you in different directions, making you feel as though you don’t have time for everything on your plate. Your work demands may be overwhelming you to the point where there’s no energy left for family or your own personal time. Here’s a hint from the cosmos: start creating boundaries at the office. Free up precious hours for your loved ones and your own enjoyment.

"
8 march 2017,libra,"Work that body! The ability to transform your physique and feel more vibrant while you’re at it is in the stars, Libra. The next week is super for initiating an exercise routine and better eating habits. Considering that the full moon on the 12th falls in your house of surgery, physical therapy and major healing, you can also take care of serious health issues over the next few months.

"
9 march 2017,libra,"You’re about to enter a touchy time, Libra. Love planet just retrograded in your house of commitment. And today Mars enters an associated sector, the house of intimacy and sexuality. Let’s put it this way—any issues in your relationship will come bubbling to the surface, either quietly or with an explosion. The full moon coming on Sunday is in your house of closure. Either make peace with your lover or move on. Singles, get straight on what you really want in love.

"
10 march 2017,libra,"Roles may need to be revised in a team effort, along with changes in procedure, but you’ll be able to work with that today. Let others know that in order for things to run smoothly that they need to do their fair share and cooperate. You’ve been working hard lately, Libra, too hard. Establish boundaries and expectations, then step aside.

"
11 march 2017,libra,"In order to stay on top of your many activities and responsibilities, you may need to adjust your attitude about just how much stuff you can handle! Abundant Jupiter may have you think that you can multitask like nobody’s business, but the reality is that you can’t. Actually now is a great time to delegate or hire people who can do some of the grunt work for you.

"
12 march 2017,libra,"A highly cathartic full moon takes place this evening, Libra, and you can benefit enormously by letting past dramas go. Sometimes you need to talk things over with others in order to feel better, but not this time. You can do a lot of inner healing on your own. If you try to communicate with others they may just put up resistance. You know your truth—accept it and be happy with it

"
13 march 2017,libra,"Who deserves to stay in your orbit, and who should be sent to another galaxy? A number of planets are shining their light on your closest connections. Yesterday’s full moon is helping you to create a short list while Mercury’s entry into Aries will help you talk things over. Watch out for drama, though, as aggressive Mars is in your house of passion.

"
14 march 2017,libra,"Moody blues? You could experience them today as La Luna stirs up your feelings. You could face opposition from a lover or family members, and the key is to be as realistic as possible about what’s going on. Don’t let optimism, passion or emotions guide your thoughts and actions today.

"
15 march 2017,libra,"Setting positive new habits should be a snap today with a strong Moon-Saturn connection. Sometimes you just have to realize that your existing routines aren’t taking you where you want to go. If that’s the case, self reflect, decide a few things you’d like to change, and swing into action.

"
16 march 2017,libra,"Are too many chefs spoiling the sauce? Could be with the aspects on offer today and tomorrow! Neptune is in a great spot for Libras, helping them become inspired and run with their ideas. But if too many people get involved you run the risk of others mucking things up and creating delays. Your best bet is to work solo, at least until Monday when the Sun enters your partnership zone.

"
17 march 2017,libra,"Doctor’s orders! The planets warn that you should be paying attention to what your body is telling you, Libra, along with any health care professionals that you work with. If you don’t there could be a “reality check” coming your way. While it doesn’t appear to be life threatening, it could throw you off your feet for awhile. Why tempt fate? Be a good boy or girl and take your medicine.

"
18 march 2017,libra,"This has been an interesting year for you especially in relationships, as Jupiter has been stirring up an independent streak. But that all begins to change this weekend as a yummy Venus-Mercury convo gets you more interested in bonding with someone on a deeper level. Once the Sun moves into Aries on Monday things will heat up considerably, so get back into the game.

"
19 march 2017,libra,"Say what you mean and mean what you say. A meet up of stern Saturn and the emotional Moon helps you put your thoughts and feelings out there. You may need to remind people where you’re coming from later this week when a tough T-square takes place on Thursday and Friday. Protect your time and peace of mind.

"
20 march 2017,libra,"Is it time to find new love—or grow closer to the person who is already in your life? Singles, are you ready to end your days in the desert–or do you want to remain footloose and fancy free for awhile? Now that the Sun is in Aries, your partnership sector, these are some of the thoughts that will be going through your mind. Happily attached Libras can grow even closer to their amour. The next four weeks can be game changers.

"
21 march 2017,libra,"You may feel like doing what you want these days, thanks to optimistic Jupiter in your sign, but it would be smart to consider the needs and viewpoints of others. Does this mean, though, that you have to bend to their will? Hell no! Just listen, as they may have some valuable input. Then make your own decisions and sally forth.

"
22 march 2017,libra,"A struggle may be arising within you concerning your priorities. What’s more important—your family or your career? Taking some down time for yourself or spending every free moment with your amour? Handling your work load all by yourself or aligning with a partner who can carry some of it with you? Consider your options today. By the weekend you may end up making some important decisions.

"
23 march 2017,libra,"It’s your life, Libra. How do you want to spend your time, and with whom? What goals do you want to pursue? A tense aspect between pushy Pluto and verbal Mars indicates that someone close may try to clip your wings. Not happening! To thine own self be true.

"
24 march 2017,libra,"My, are we a bit pessimistic today about an alliance—personal or business? It could be, courtesy of a Mercury-Jupiter smackdown in the skies. In astrology, its the outer planets that will prevail with their message, so optimistic Jupiter will win this battle. As a matter of fact, tomorrow is a good day to make amends with a partner—or for singles to find new love

"
25 march 2017,libra,"The love train is chugging into town. The question is: do you want to get on board? If you’ve been on the fence about romance, a happy Venus-Sun connection today could dispel doubts. As a matter of fact the next six months are super for making progress in love, whether it’s an existing romance or a new one.

"
26 march 2017,libra,"Get to the heart of the matter. Serious discussions with a lover can bear fruit with two helpful aspects in the heavens. There’s a spontaneous vibe to this, as if a conversation that is overdue is suddenly brought to the fore. It’s a smart time to talk about what may be on your mind, considering that the new moon on Tuesday opens up a fresh chapter in romance. Unattached Libras could meet someone between now and August who is both dreamy and practical at the same time.

"
27 march 2017,libra,"Some new assignments or career opportunities could come your way, but you have to be on top of your game in order to run with them. Which means: polish up your resume, wrap up half-finished projects, make sure that you team knows what is expected of them, and empty out your e-mail account. Efficiency is what it’s all about.

"
28 march 2017,libra,"Despite the fact that Jupiter has been encouraging you since October to march to the beat of your own drum, today’s new moon suggests that more cooperation with others should be considered. Therefore, if a relationship with a lover, family member or business partner has been tense, you’re being given an excellent opportunity to repair it. The lines of communication swing wide open tomorrow with a helpful Mercury-Saturn trine, the best aspect possible in astrology.

"
29 march 2017,libra,"Serious discussions with loved ones and business connections can take place without drama and anger, thanks to sober, mature Saturn in a good angle. Try to get matters wrapped up with family members, room mates and spouses especially, as Thursday brings a difficult aspect. Let others know what you expect of them and that you intend to hold them to some new rules.

"
30 march 2017,libra,"You’re in a great spot with abundant and optimistic Jupiter in your sign. It’s green lights ahead—but you have to make sure that you don’t go overboard, taking on too many tasks or expecting things to happen overnight. It’s also possible that someone in your circle may try to coerce you into doing things their way, as they recognize that you’re blazing your own path ahead. Stick to your own agenda.

"
31 march 2017,libra,"Talk flirty to me. Heck, you can even talk a little dirty to me! Now that verbal Mercury is in the sexy house of libido you could turn into quite the lusty little devil. But this is also the house of deep, intimate talks that take place on a more soulful level. So pour your heart out to your amour, and do it before Mercury retrogrades on April 9th. Singles, send out an APB that you’re on the market and looking for love.

"
1 april 2017,libra,"This month’s full moon on the 11th is in your sign, Libra, which will put the spotlight on you. Considering a bikini-buff body for the summer months as part of being in that spotlight? If that’s the case, then get ready to polish up your physique as glamour girl Venus begins to retrograde tomorrow through your house of fitness. Research your options. Which diet to go on? Work out at the gym, or start jogging outside? Yoga or Pilates? How about beefing up your vitamin intake? Then get ready to swing into gear, especially after the 15th when Venus resumes direct motion.

"
2 april 2017,libra,"With next week’s full moon coming in your sign, it’s time to start planning the next six months of your life. Venus retrogrades today into your productivity sector, forcing you to examine your habits and routines. If you’re looking to develop a hotter body or more vibrant health this is the perfect time to do so, as glam Venus will be in the house of diet and exercise.

"
3 april 2017,libra,"The Moon lights a fire underneath you to take care of your health and to work that body! Glamorous Venus just retrograded into this part of your chart yesterday, so if you decide to work out solely for looking sexy, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. You may have to go it alone, though. Trying to get your spouse to join you may be futile. The same goes for lining up an exercise buddy. Blaze your own path.

"
4 april 2017,libra,"A colleague or business partner might act out today in a manner that you wouldn’t expect. Your initial reaction may be to blast them, thanks to the emotional Moon in your house of authority, but your best bet is to maintain your composure. This energy repeats itself on Friday, so it ain’t over quickly. Next Tuesday’s full moon in your sign, though, will put you in the driver’s seat. Wait until then to make your expectations clear.

"
5 april 2017,libra,"Rally the troops and try to get everyone working toward the same goal, Libra. You’re in a good spot to be listened to, as inspirational Neptune is helping you come up with creative ideas to old problems. While not everyone will be sold on your ideas enough people will be–and that’s all you need.

"
6 april 2017,libra,"Becoming a more polished person is possible, especially now that Saturn is retrograde in your house of self-expression. Over the next five months you can go back to school, perfect your public speaking skills, touch up your manuscript, and become more confident and social. This aspect is terrific for learning how to blog, finesse Photoshop or Illustrator, or write a screenplay. Opening up the lines of communication with your nearest and dearest should become easier as well.

"
7 april 2017,libra,"With optimistic Jupiter in your sign you might be feeling mighty positive about what you can accomplish. There’s nothing wrong with that as long as you’re realistic about time frames, the resources you’ll need and expectations others have of you. The problem is that a tense Sun-Jupiter aspect may bring about resentment between you and others. Are they jealous of your motivation? Do they need more of your time? Or are you getting fed up with their demands? Next week’s full moon in Libra could bring all of this to a head.

"
8 april 2017,libra,"Who’s doing all of the grunt work in your family? Make sure that it’s not you, a good possibility with two squares taking place in the heavens. Don’t let siblings, kids, parents or a lover dump their chores on you. Nor should you always be playing the role of the family counselor, confidante or enabler. Enough already. Next week’s full moon in Libra is all about you stepping out and living your own life. You can’t be burdened by everyone else’s problems.

"
9 april 2017,libra,"Protect your net worth over the next few weeks as Mercury begins to retrograde in your house of finances. If possible, avoid borrowing large sums of money through the 20th, such as a mortgage or loan for your business. Can’t avoid it or can’t wait? Then double check the documents and numbers. The same holds true for credit cars statements, student loans, alimony and other court awards and inheritances. And curb your spending while you’re at it!

"
10 april 2017,libra,"Are you willing to take some risks in order to live a more authentic life? A Moon-Jupiter meet up encourages you to pursue your passions, but you may have to do things that are past your comfort zone. Tomorrow’s full moon in your sign will give you the final kick in the pants that you need.

"
11 april 2017,libra,"It’s showtime, baby! The once-a-year full moon in Libra occurs today, boosting your confidence and drive. With Saturn in a terrific angle form your house of communicating, this is an excellent time to promote an idea or your reputation. People will be interested in what you have to say, so don’t hold back. However, tough aspects involving Pluto and Uranus indicate that there could be resistance from family members or a lover. Remember: it’s your life.

"
12 april 2017,libra,"You may have been burning the candle at both ends over the past month, ignoring your health while you’ve tended to errands and work assignments. Today’s planetary aspects tell you to get back on track with fitness and dieting. Once Venus resumes direct motion on Saturday you’ll be more interested in looking gorgeous, too!

"
13 april 2017,libra,"Getting down to the basics is on the planets’ agenda, so don’t be surprised if you go into full feng shui mode at home or the office. An orderly, clean environment is one of the fundamentals of serene living, but in order to maintain it new habits and routines need to be established.

"
14 april 2017,libra,"Relationships could turn on a dime today, thanks to a wonky Sun-Uranus conjunction. When these two meet up just about anything can happen. Chances are you’ll be quite vocal in either a business or romantic union, letting the other party know just how you feel and what you want. There’s no need to be dictatorial but if you’ve had enough, consider your other options.

"
15 april 2017,libra,"Obsession, worrying, stress–you may have been dealing with all of these stinkers over the past month as Venus has been retrograde in your house of efficiency. Fortunately it moves back into direct motion today, so red tape, uncooperative co-workers and deadlined may ease up. This is also a good time to get back on track with taking better care of your body through sports and better nutrition.

"
16 april 2017,libra,"Working more closely with other people is necessary, and as long as you can honor their opinions things should work out well. The next 48 hours are a good time to start developing some common ground with people both at home and at work. That’s not to say that others will always respect your  opinions, but current aspects are requiting diplomacy at your end.

"
17 april 2017,libra,"This is one of the best times all year to showcase your ideas and talent, so don’t hold back! Projects that you initiate hold long term potential, so much so that people may want to collaborate with you on them. Before signing on the dotted line, however, do your homework on possible partners. Mercury is about to retrograde in this part of your chart on Thursday.

"
18 april 2017,libra,"You may need to lay down some boundaries for the people closest to you, such as family or roommates…but with the Moon in an emotional spot you could be reluctant to do so. Don’t hold back, Libra! Pluto is about to retrograde in this part of your chart. The bottom line is that if you  don’t take control of matters now, other people will–and you’ll be stuck doing things their way.

"
19 april 2017,libra,"Matters of the heart will occupy a good deal of your attention over the next few weeks as the Sun has just entered your house of passion and intimacy. But despite your desire to bond soulfully with another, Mercury’s retrograde turn on Thursday will find you questioning just how committed you are to the idea. Things will be up in the air through May 3rd, so be patient and don’t make any key decisions for now.

"
20 april 2017,libra,"Are my relationships solid? You may be harboring these kinds of thoughts over the next few months, especially with family or a lover. Powerful Pluto retrogrades in your house of comfort and stability, making you question the strength of your connections. But this can be helpful as Pluto will point out to you the areas where you’re letting others take advantage of you. Go slowly and read between the lines when people are talking. If a relationship isn’t worth the trouble you’ll know soon enough.

"
21 april 2017,libra,"Get ready for liftoff! Red hot Mars enters your bold and optimistic house of adventure. Start thinking out of the box and get ready to share your brilliance with others. There’s a strong profit vibe associated with this, so if you’re dreaming up money-making ideas it’s time to run with them. With Pluto retrograde in your house of security, chances are you won’t do anything too rash—like quitting the day job and opening up a tiki bar on the beach.

"
22 april 2017,libra,"You may be gung ho about blasting through your tasks, whether at home or at work, but the cosmos tells you to dial things down a little bit. Stern Saturn warns that you need to pay attention to details, otherwise you might make a mistake. Likewise, you’re currently in danger of taking on more activities or work than a human being can possibly handle. Be discerning and choose only the best projects to pursue.

"
23 april 2017,libra,"If looking at your buck naked body in the mirror is making you grimace rather than smiling proudly, then today’s the perfect time to start a diet and fitness routine. Who cares about your cholesterol level when looking hot will do? There’s a strong vanity thing going on thanks to Venus. But the good thing is that when you start taking care of yourself—for your ego, revenge on an ex, fitting into your old jeans—you’ll end up getting healthier and more vibrant. Which is also sexy, dontcha know.

"
24 april 2017,libra,"Dynamic duos take flight with a winning Saturn-Mercury meet up! This could be a business deal or a romantic one, but either way the key is to communicate. Let someone know that you’re interested, discuss the terms of an upcoming arrangement (whether it’s your wedding or forming a corporation) and start working on the next step. The new moon on Wednesday will push things along even further.

"
25 april 2017,libra,"With a new moon coming in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, becoming more intimate with a lover is in the stars. But it won’t happen unless the lines of communication are open, and a positive Uranus-Saturn aspect helps build them. Uranus acts quickly and encourages you to do things differently than before, so consider new ways to reach out to your amour.

"
26 april 2017,libra,"A happier new phase in romance begins with the Taurus new moon in your house of intimacy and bonding. The lines of communication can swing wide open thanks to a spontaneous aspect between Uranus and Saturn. The ringed planet demands that relationship issues be handled logically and maturely, so count to ten and speak your piece.

"
27 april 2017,libra,"Ready to set aside more cash in a retirement account or savings plan? Yesterday’s new moon was just the ticket for creating a winning strategy. But with demanding Pluto in your house of security and comfort, this won’t happen by magic. Pluto is the planet of personal power. You want more money in reserves? It’s up to you to make it happen.

"
28 april 2017,libra,"Partnerships of all kinds can take a far more serious turn now that Venus is in your house of forming or strengthening alliances. But this golden girl is the planet of ease, so things should progress nicely without a lot of tension and disagreements. Mercury is retrograde, though, so don’t agree to anything major just yet, whether it’s in romance or business. Once Mercury goes direct on May 3rd you can commit with greater peace of mind.

"
29 april 2017,libra,"Slow and steady wins the race every time, Libra, something to remind yourself of today. The Moon is in an impatient spot, anxious for more fun, faster results and more independence. But Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither will your life circumstances change overnight. Put in the time and any necessary effort, then wait for the manifestation to take place.

"
30 april 2017,libra,"They say that you can’t go off on an exciting journey until you’re willing to leave the shore. While that may be true, and adventures may be calling your name, the planets are telling you to take care of the details first. Serious Saturn demands strategizing, discussion and deep thinking before you embark on anything  important—a marriage, business deal, going to grad school, launching a business, you name it.

"
1 may 2017,libra,"Sometimes it seems as though the only person patting you on the back fro a job well done is yourself! That may be the case today with a Moon-Mercury square. Don’t expect others to be supportive, at least not in the early part of the week. Once Mercury resumes direct motion on Wednesday you’ll be able to speak your mind and let people know that you expect a little thanks and praise now and then.

"
2 may 2017,libra,"“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams”. So said a very wise woman, Eleanor Roosevelt. And the beauty of your  dreams may become apparent today as the passionate Moon forms a dreamy aspect with Mars. But this isn’t just fantasizing about a future that will never come true. The full moon on the 10th falls in one of the most practical parts of your chart. Use its energy to fuel your passions.

"
3 may 2017,libra,"The Love Boat, which has been stuck at the dock over the past few weeks thanks to Mercury in retrograde, is about to set sail—so climb on board! Relationship matters straighten out, singles have a better chance of meeting a keeper and your sex life might even improve. The Sun is in the sector that governs intimacy and libido, telling you to work things out with your lover in a practical way. This is not time for fantasy-fueled thinking.

"
4 may 2017,libra,"A secretive Venus-Moon aspect might find you keeping your emotions to yourself—but is that wise? Sometimes people need to know what’s going on in that head of yours. They’re not mind readers, so sort out your thoughts and get ready to share them. Tomorrow is the perfect time to open up. And next week’s full moon in Scorpio will work wonders for your self-esteem.

"
5 may 2017,libra,"Are you bringing sexy back? Where the hell did it go? Listen, losing your mojo is something that happens to all of us. Stress, fatigue, family pressures—it all builds up. But now it’s time to get back in touch with your inner groove thang. The Sun is in the most soulful, libidinous part of your chart, so let its rays warm you up.

"
6 may 2017,libra,"It’s over.  Put a fork in it: it’s done. That may be your attitude as the Moon transits your house of closure. Sometimes ya just gotta get rid of the time and energy vampires that are sucking on us, which can include people as well as habits. If you decide to cut someone off, however, there’s no need to go public with it. Subtly pull away from them if you can.

"
7 may 2017,libra,"A happy meeting of the Moon and Jupiter in your sign puts you in the mood for taking good care of yourself. So pamper away! And while you’re at it, the cosmos suggests taking better care of your health. With glamorous Neptune in your house of physique, looking gloriously sexy and fit is a real possibility.

"
8 may 2017,libra,"You may not be too interested in what someone has to say today, especially if the other person is a close connection! But you should pay attention to them nonetheless as their words may carry some wisdom. None of us has all of the answers and we can benefit from other opinions and advice. Don’t be stubborn, because in the end you will make your own decisions anyway.

"
9 may 2017,libra,"Serious relationships are front and center this week, thanks to a powerful Pluto-Sun trine today. This is a game changer as it will force you to make a decision about the future of a bond. Emotions will be high as these two orbs are in the most intimate and security-conscious parts of your chart. But logic will also be in play as tomorrow’s full moon falls in a very practical sector.

"
10 may 2017,libra,"Sweet! A full moon in your income sector could wrap up plans that you’ve been working on to earn more. From your chart it appears that other people could end up being influential in your future success: a business partner, booking agent, attorney, angel investor or mentor. Don’t be afraid to ask someone for advice or assistance as they could be the missing key you need to develop a stronger income. If you’re considering a real estate purchase, the aspects are excellent.

"
11 may 2017,libra,"You’re in quite a strategic phase these days, Libra, thanks to a number of planets helping you brainstorm, negotiate, sign deals and line up financing. By the way, this goes for your personal life as well as your career: finding a partner, getting engaged or working as a couple to develop a strong financial base. But a difficult Mars-Neptune square today indicates that some of your plans may need to be scaled back. You may be in such a rush to get somewhere that you’re overlooking key details. Slow down before you make a mistake.

"
12 may 2017,libra,"It’s no secret that with expansive Jupiter in your sign since last fall, you of all the signs should be going after your heart’s desire, whatever that may be. Jupiter is the planet of abundance and optimism (and profits too!). Well, today the cosmos slaps some rocket boosters on to this situation as red hot, motivational Mars forms a fabulous trine with Jupiter. The sky truly is the limit, so get ready for liftoff.

"
13 may 2017,libra,"Excellent day to have serious talks with a loved one. The emotional Moon is in the most verbal part of your chart, which sometimes leads to hysterical blabbering. But that won’t happen as La Luna is in a conjunction with sober, rational Saturn. So speak your piece as your words will have gravitas. And if you need to speak to a counselor, confidante or mentor about something important it’s an auspicious day to do so. Becoming more mentally balanced is what it’s all about.

"
14 may 2017,libra,"If you’re stuck in a creative rut at the office it’s time to dig yourself out, Libra. Regardless as to what you do for a living, the big bucks and kudos go to those who bring fresh ideas to the marketplace. Doing things the same old way makes you a good soldier but doesn’t differentiate you from the crowd. Fortunately inspirational Neptune has your back, helping you approach things from a far more innovative viewpoint.

"
15 may 2017,libra,"You have some strong opinions these days, but that doesn’t mean that everyone will see things your way. That’s OK–you should still voice your opinions. With serious Saturn in your communication sector you’ll say what you mean and mean what you say. If others can’t take it, don’t sweat it. You’ve done your part.

"
16 may 2017,libra,"Put on your Sherlock Holmes hat and whip out the magnifying glass: perceptive Mercury is in your eighth house, the place of digging deep, whether that means your emotions, someone else’s (not to mention their agenda) or simply conducting research about a business opportunity. I suppose you could start snooping your lover’s texts and e-mails—a possibility under this aspect—but you really won’t have to. Mercury’s intelligence will help you ferret out the truth in a situation without you having to go “undercover”.

"
17 may 2017,libra,"Social invitations will be coming your way and you should definitely take advantage of them! Today your magnetism is off the charts, thanks to a happy Moon-Jupiter aspect. Use it to flirt, win people over, promote yourself and simply have more fun. Once the Sun enters Gemini this weekend you will be meeting folks who are a different breed than the people you’re used to, so prepare to have an open mind.

"
18 may 2017,libra,"A critical Venus-Jupiter opposition warns you to not get carried away in romance. It’s all well and good to feel amorous but sometimes ya just gotta keep it real, seeing your partner for who they are. This holds for singles who are searching for a mate as well as those long-attached Libras. Putting someone on a pedestal, refusing to acknowledge problems in a relationship, being way too anxious to settle down and get married—all of these will backfire unless you’re operating with some logical thought.

"
19 may 2017,libra,"If you need to get something off your chest with a lover or business partner, today’s the day! A sparkling and unusual Uranus-Saturn trine urges you to stop holding back and to open up. It’s also an auspicious moment to discuss new possibilities and plans, things that you may not have considered before but sound enticing. A fresh chapter opens up that will take you into mid-November, allowing you to take a more relaxed attitude about your role in the relationship.

"
20 may 2017,libra,"Your life over the next four weeks may seem like a brain-a-thon, thanks to the Sun’s movement into one of the most mental parts of your chart. This is the ninth house, and we certainly don’t think small when this sector is activated. Taking risks, trying new endeavors, getting out there and learning about the world through travel and study—that’s what it’s all about. In addition, serious Saturn happens to be occupying the other  house of the mind, the third house. As a result you’ll be dreaming up all sorts of brilliant ideas. Be careful, though, that you don’t try to sway others into your way of thinking as pushy Mars is on the scene. Got a great notion? Then run with it, but don’t expect overnight success or for everyone to be as enthralled as you are.

"
21 may 2017,libra,"Hmm, someone’s feeling adventurous these days and they look an awful lot like Libras! That’s because the Sun just entered the most free wheeling, optimistic part of your chart. And today the luscious Moon tells you to take a chance in romance, whether that means dating a different type or grabbing your lover and doing something fun that you’ve never tried before. (That does include the boudoir, by the way.)

"
22 may 2017,libra,"This is not a day to play the Lone Ranger, sticking to your guns and not cooperating. Nope, pardner, compromise and communication are key as charming Venus meets up with the Moon. You can get much further these days if you play nice with others. Word to the wise: let them do most of the talking and keep your opinions to yourself.

23 may 2017,libra,"Got a brilliant idea, say, for writing a book, launching a business or embarking on some new kind of adventure? Not surprising with energetic Mars in this part of your chart, and a new moon occurring here on Thursday. The smartest thing you can do right now is to take bold plans and break them into “bite-sized” pieces. Otherwise overwhelm will quickly set in. And from your chart it appears that you may not get as much help from others as you might like, so plan on doing a lot on your own.

"
24 may 2017,libra,"From your chart it appears that you need some down time, whether you’re single or attached, have kids or don’t. Today’s a good time to relax and play a bit, or even just to sit outdoors in nature and meditate. Tomorrow’s new moon falls in your house of adventure and risk taking, so get ready to turn up the dial when it comes to having fun. Don’t feel so tied down to your chores at home or your family demands that you don’t block out time for yourself.

"
25 may 2017,libra,"Who or what is holding you back? Identifying these problems is the key to finessing today’s new moon, which occurs in the most adventurous part of your chart. Get ready to take a calculated risk. It’s possible that with Saturn in Sagittarius, you may be feeling more cautious than is necessary. And if a lover or family members are getting in your way, you may need to put them on notice to butt out—you’ve got a life to live.

"
26 may 2017,libra,"There’s nothing better than having some adventure, and considering that the Sun is now in this part of your chart you’re more than ready for some new experiences! And isn’t it nice of the cosmos to deliver some your way this weekend. But you won’t be having fun just by yourself. Grab your honey or some pals and plan away. You weren’t destined to hide in the shadows, so get out in the sunshine and play!

"
27 may 2017,libra,"You’re certainly not suffering from a shortage of lofty ideas. The problem is choosing which ones to run with! Megawatt Mars has your brain more stirred up than a beehive that someone just rattled. Slow down, pour yourself a cuppa or glass of Pinot, and really think about your next move. This weekend is a good time to confide in a good friend or mentor and seek their advice.

"
28 may 2017,libra,"Pay attention to some of the deep thoughts that have been bubbling in your mind lately as they hold the key to a better future. Right now is the perfect time to merge your intuitive thoughts with more logical ones. Being inspired is always wonderful, but not everyone acts upon their ideas. You can, thanks to the presence of Neptune in your house of getting things done.

"
29 may 2017,libra,"Someone may hit you with a lot of hard questions today, courtesy of aggressive Mars being in a militant mood. They may demand guarantees or a leaner budget or a promise that things will change. This could occur in any area of your life, so get ready to be challenged. On the flip side, you  may be the one asking all of the questions. Uncertainty and hesitation are in the air, but the good thing is that this passes quickly. Just avoid making snap decisions until you know more.

"
30 may 2017,libra,"Support may come from an unexpected source, Libra. You’ve got some pretty big plans in mind and this is no time to try to go it alone. Reach out to others, people who may have traveled down the path you want to trod. Uranus, planet of genius, has your back and can put you in touch with folks who will share their wisdom.

"
31 may 2017,libra,"You’ll be able to think with both your head and your heart as intelligent Mercury has taken up residence in the house of deep emotions. Helping him along is subterranean Pluto, an expert at ferreting out issues that need to be dealt with. This is a cathartic aspect, so allow yourself to be vulnerable and work your way through it.

"
1 june 2017,libra,"Your power of persuasion is ramping up, Libra, and the next week or two are crucial for getting your opinions out there. This holds true in matters of the heart as well as business. If you think that retaining an expert, such as a PR agent or booking agent, will help your career, today is excellent for holding talks. It’s also an auspicious time for having heart to heart convos with your amour, talking about where you’re headed.

"
1 june 2016,libra,"Stalling tactics! You’re raring to go, whether it’s blasting through your household chores or the pile on your desk at the office. But someone  seems determined to throw a monkey wrench into the works. WTF? The culprit is a difficult square between Neptune and the Sun. Coworkers or family members could be either indecisive or deliberately ornery. Put on your seat belt. This continues into the weekend.

"
2 june 2017,libra,"This may easily be one of the best times all year to go and shout it from the mountaintops. What is the “it” I’m referring to? Your idea for a screenplay or manuscript. Your marketing campaign or a video that you want to go viral. Your opinion about what needs to be changed in our political system, followed up with a concrete plan for taking action. Your brand and why people should pay attention to it. Your desire to improve yourself, whether that’s via education or by delving into a new philosophy. Go for it!

"
2 june 2016,libra,"Yum! What a good day for sharing your deepest thoughts with someone you love. The passionate Moon in the most intimate part of your chart forms a marvelous angle with the North Node, suggesting that healing is on the way. Neptune is also helpful, wanting you to develop a greater sense of security. Make sure to spend some quiet, quality time with your amour.

"
3 june 2017,libra,"It’s always time to celebrate when the two most optimistic orbs in the solar system unite, and that’s what happening today. Lucky Jupiter trines the fiery Sun, telling you to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight. If you’ve been secretly harboring a desire or a dream, now’s the time to stop thinking about it and actually do something about it. With intense Mars entering your house of goals and ambition tomorrow, the next eight weeks are superb for developing momentum as you move into a new way of living.

"
3 june 2016,libra,"Picky, picky, picky. A planetary slugfest (also known as a Grand Cross) is turning Libra into quite the choosy one. Too bad you can’t make up your mind. The Sun and Venus are telling you to reach for the stars, but then stern Saturn pulls you back to Earth with a thud. Neptune is pushing you into anal-retentive land in which nothing is good enough, then Jupiter tells you to Zen out, be grateful and surround everything with a white light. It’s rainbows and unicorns versus the cold cruel light of dawn. Fear not. Once Monday rolls around, you’ll feel more in balance—and ready to be more adventurous!

"
4 june 2017,libra,"The brakes are off! Megawatt Mars cruises into your ambition and success sector, its first visit here in over two years. Whether you’re looking for love, want to write the next best seller, run a marathon or crush it in the business world, the motivation will be there. With Mercury just about ready to enter your optimistic house of risk taking, you’ll be thinking bigger and bolder than usual. Carpe diem.

"
5 june 2017,libra,"It’s one thing to know what you want, it’s another to figure out how to go about getting it. With the Sun in the loftiest sector of your chart, you should have no shortage of bright ideas. But murky Neptune is getting in the way of execution. This is not  the time to “wing it”. Nor is it wise to ignore details or the systems, resources and people that you may need in the near future. Pay attention to the nitty gritty and the big picture will take care of itself.

"
6 june 2017,libra,"Vision quest, anyone? The planets are aligning in such a way that you may finally acquire a new philosophy about life that feeds your heart and your mind. If this means reading books about metaphysics, beginning a meditation practice or treating your body as if it’s a temple, so be it. The next few weeks may bring the utmost catharsis. Give yourself the time and the freedom to allow it to unfold.

"
7 june 2017,libra,"A wonderful opportunity for expanding your mind is available to you, Libra! Mental Mercury has just entered the most philosophical part of your chart. Don’t be surprised if you start picking up books written by Thoreau or Emerson, or the Tao Te Ching. Maybe you’ll book a trip to an Indian reservation this summer to witness a bona fide powwow. Podcasts of interviews with the greatest thinkers of our time might also be on your list. This aspect runs through the 21st, but you may become a life-long learner.

"
8 june 2017,libra,"Curb your enthusiasm! There are only 24 hours in a day, Libra, something that you may have been forgetting lately. Deceptive Neptune may make you feel as though you have plenty of time to complete a particular task or goal, but in reality it may take longer than you think. Adding to this is optimistic Jupiter, which could be making you feel like Superman or woman. Not! The full moon on Friday will bring clarity and the chance to strategize better.

"
9 june 2017,libra,"You’re in the spotlight today Libra, as a full moon in your house of self-expression allows you to dazzle others with your smarts. Something that you’ve been working on may come to a happy conclusion: your college application or term paper, a marketing campaign, the manuscript you’ve been toiling on for years, or a pitch that you made awhile back to a decision maker. Someone may even express the desire to join with you in a formal business partnership or act as your agent. With red hot Mars known your career house, things can take off quickly.

"
10 june 2017,libra,"You may have been in a reflective state over the past few months, Libra, courtesy of Jupiter being retrograde in your sign. Perhaps your self confidence was a bit low, or confusion reigned over which direct to head in. Thank goodness that’s over now as the gas giant resumes direct motion. Between now and October 10th you should dive in to as many new projects as possible, keeping your mind open to possibilities that you may not have considered before.

"
11 june 2017,libra,"Unexpected events may occur this week, but these are good ones! From your chart it appears that your friends or a lover are the source of the action, so make plans with them. You’re up for some new experiences anyway.

"
12 june 2017,libra,"Yowza! Your spirits soar as inspiration and optimism pour from the heavens into that head of yours. A superb Mercury-Jupiter trine allows you to think about things in ways you had never considered before. Just don’t get too carried away and wander into fantasy land.

"
13 june 2017,libra,"Details may seem a bit fuzzy, as if you need more information before you proceed with something. Murky Neptune is spinning its fog, so progress could be slow until you ferret out what you need to know. Don’t rely on other people to provide you with the scoop as they may be confused themselves. Try to get to the bottom of things before Friday.
 

"
14 june 2017,libra,"If you need to hold a conversation with a lover or a child about something significant, do so today. The emotional Moon will help you get your point across with clarity and logic; no drama needed! Tomorrow’s another story, however, when the Sun opposes Saturn. Your loved ones might not be amenable to your opinions, so strike while the iron is hot.

"
15 june 2017,libra,"Optimism should be running high, Libra, thanks to the Sun sailing through one of the most free spirited parts of your chart. The problem is that someone in your circle may be in “Grinch mode”, ready to burst your bubble with a snide remark or sending you the stink eye. This aspect reoccurs on Sunday, but don’t let a troll bother you. Once the Sun enters Cancer next Wednesday you’ll become even more determined to enjoy the good things in life.

"
16 june 2017,libra,"Your sign is known for being willing to work as a team member, but over the next five months you may feel like no one else is. That’s because murky Neptune retrogrades in your house of efficiency, which not only refers to your own productivity but that of the people around you. Get ready for unreliable kids, family members and co-workers. Since you can only control your own level of efficiency, identify the areas of your own life that could use smarter habits and routines.

"
17 june 2017,libra,"Not thrilled with your physique or state of health? Then get past the notion that you’re destined to live with the body you currently have. Now that cleansing Neptune is retrograde in your health and vitality sector you have the opportunity to address your weight issues. Chronic aches and pains can also be 86’d, so start finding solutions.

"
18 june 2017,libra,"Adventure is calling your name, Libra. It’s time to get out of Dodge and head off into the wild blue yonder. All those things on your bucket list that you say you’re going to do someday? Someday is here and now.

"
19 june 2017,libra,"Sometimes ideas are ahead of their time, and that’s the case with yours today, Libra. People may not be able to see the wisdom (hell, the brilliance) in what you’re putting forth. Just wait a day or two. When the Sun enters Cancer on Wednesday they’ll be more inclined to listen.

"
20 june 2017,libra,"With the Sun moving into the most ambitious part of your chart tomorrow, you may already be thinking about your next big move. You might want to consider teaming up with someone else in order to develop momentum and reach your goals. A productive Mercury-Uranus aspect today suggests finding a like-minded person to work with, or even an expert who can provide you with savvy advice. Two heads are better than one.

"
22 june 2017,libra,"Now that the Sun and Mercury have joined energetic Mars in your ambition sector, you should be more than ready to get moving with important goals. However, Neptune just went retrograde in your detail-oriented sixth house, perhaps creating confusion about the best strategy and systems to use. Work this out before you plunge ahead.

"
23 june 2017,libra,"With tomorrow’s new moon occurring in your house of ambition, you may be wondering if your plans are do-able. They are! The Moon, Mercury and Sun all hold a logical, thoughtful conversation today about which direction you should be heading in. You’re not in fantasy land: you’re in the right place to make things happen.

"
24 june 2017,libra,"A brand new chapter can open up in your career as today’s new moon takes place in the most ambitious part of your chart. If you’ve been thinking about starting a home-based business, or want to telecommute from home, the aspects for doing so are excellent. But regardless as to where you do your thing, just don’t push yourself too hard too fast. You have the next six months to make strides.

"
25 june 2017,libra,"Your success over the next six months will be shaped by more than mere motivation on your part. Sure, assertive Mars is currently helping you develop momentum as it cruises through your ambition sector. And there was a new moon in this house a few days ago. But you have to make sure that you have the right systems in place and the right kind of people by your side in order to take that victory lap.

"
26 june 2017,libra,"It’s time to motivate the troops and get everyone together to work toward a common goal. You’re currently in a place where you can achieve a lot (thanks to so much planetary activity in your ambition sector) but you’ll need cooperation from others. You’ve got what it takes to motivate them, so put on your leader persona and make it happen.

"
27 june 2017,libra,"You need to become more organized, and with constructive Neptune in your house of efficiency this should be a snap. Helping matters along is whip smart Mercury, which will help you prioritize and think things through logically.

"
27 june 2016,libra,"Yee-ha! Planet of negotiation and commerce, Mercury, zips into your career sector—just as Mars goes direct in your income house! This is one heck of a day for advancement in your job or business, as inspirational Neptune is also on the job, helping bring in new clients, projects or job offers. It doesn’t get much better than this. The energy will last for several days, so use it to your advantage.

"
28 june 2017,libra,"The next few weeks are your best time all year to make career progress, and today could mark a turning point. The planet of motivation, Mars, meets up with shrewd negotiator Mercury. This is one heck of a day to network, schedule a job interview, call a major prospect, put together a business plan or research a business idea. Don’t waste it!

"
28 june 2016,libra,"You’ve been peeling back layers of your subconscious mind since last summer, when Jupiter entered your house of deep reflection. Today you may be questioning the status of a romantic or business partnership, especially your own needs for security. Planetary influences indicate that you may be feeling more independent and less concerned about the opinions of others.

"
29 june 2017,libra,"An internal battle may be brewing as you consider new goals or possibilities. One little voice in your mind might be telling you to go for it, and yet another one says, “Yes, but…..”  Luckily for you, the voice that urges you to charge ahead will win this battle, while the worried one (that fears change and demands security at all costs) will be vanquished.

"
29 june 2016,libra,"A domestic or family issue may be on your mind, and you could be struggling to figure out how to handle it. On a positive note, optimistic Jupiter is active in your house of intuition, providing you with the guidance you need to put matters on the right track.

"
30 june 2017,libra,"You may feel as though you’re stuck in the middle of warring responsibilities: your work life on the one hand, and your personal and family life on the other. Fortunately, the Moon meets up with happy-go-lucky Jupiter today, helping you develop a more relaxed attitude about the whole thing. The weekend is here: be good to yourself.

"
30 june 2016,libra,"Criticism from a boss or parent could come your way today, which could leave you with an unsettled feeling. Pluto is in your house of confidence and security, but today it opposes Venus. Pluto’s job is to help us reframe the way we view situations. Is there a way that you can look at this matter with a different viewpoint?

"
1 july 2017,libra,"A diet, exercise or health protocol may need to be adjusted if you want to achieve optimal results, Libra. But this shouldn’t be a big issue, not with optimistic Jupiter involved. This vibe continues through mid-July so if you’re looking for good advice you will be able to find it.

"
1 july 2016,libra,"Sometimes in business it’s smart just to go with logic and reason, and other times it’s wiser to go with your gut. Today the latter applies. Generous Jupiter has been stationed in your psychic twelfth house since last summer, and it’s actively sending your guidance and ideas as to where you should head with your ambitions. Pay attention!

"
2 july 2017,libra,"Make sure that everyone around you has your back, Libra. With below-the-radar Pluto in a difficult spot today, people could be working their own agendas–but not in an obvious manner. The good news is that with the Sun and Mars in your authoritative tenth house, you can regain control of a situation, no matter what someone else has in mind.

"
2 july 2016,libra,"Big changes are afoot with your career, Libra, so spend some time this weekend thinking about where you want to go on your path. The first two weeks of July are superb for strategizing and getting your name and reputation out there. Contacts that you make over the next few weeks could turn out to be quite significant, not just over the next few months, but over decades.

"
3 july 2017,libra,"Being open and honest about your feelings today becomes easier with a sweet lunar aspect. If someone can’t take the truth, that says more about them than it does about you. Besides, with gentle Venus moving into Gemini on Tuesday you’re going to be living life on a bigger scale. Don’t let anyone hold you back.

"
3 july 2016,libra,"Neptune has been active in your work sector, possibly befuddling your mind. Which direction to go in? How do I handle that cranky co-worker? What’s the best way to streamline my work flow? But the Sun forms a highly productive angle to Neptune today, lighting up the path ahead. It’s time to make your life easier.

"
4 july 2017,libra,"An adventurous vibe is in the air as Venus and Mercury change signs this week, taking your life to a more sociable and optimistic place. Today Venus makes her move, entering your house of big picture thinking. Then on Wednesday chatty Mercury zips into your house of networking and friendships. What a marvelous time to bounce ideas off of people, form new alliances and party while you’re at it!

"
4 july 2016,libra,"Ready to ink a deal, make a big presentation or kick off an exciting business venture? With today’s new moon in the most ambitious part of your chart, the next few months could open doors that may have seemed firmly shut in the past. Saturn is in a good angle from your house of negotiation and contracts, indicating that whatever you initiate will be well thought out and stand the test of time.

"
5 july 2017,libra,"This is a day when teamwork will pay off, so don’t try to do everything on your own, or worse–be a renegade. Show your boss, family, co-workers or team that you’re willing to chip in and get things done. The upside? They’ll trust you in the future to be efficient, which means that they’ll be more likely to leave you alone.

"
5 july 2016,libra,"Great day to impress the boss or a client! Neptune is stirring up your imagination, helping you come up with solutions to problems and fresh new ideas. Schedule interviews, presentations. Your hard work from the past is going to pay off soon.

"
6 july 2017,libra,"Lucky Jupiter should  be buoying your enthusiasm. Problem is, not every one around you is looking at the bright side. As a matter of fact they may be downright cantankerous. But why should this ruin your day, or the “flow of your chi”  as they say in the East? You have the right to be happy, so take good care of yourself and honor this.

"
6 july 2016,libra,"Libra, you are the darling of the zodiac when it comes to career advancement, and today is a banner day. With a Mars-Venus trine and the authoritative Sun shaking hands with negotiation whiz Mercury, you couldn’t ask for a better day to let the world know about your talents. Make presentations, pitch your ideas, and schedule interviews. Between now and the 22nd is your time to shine.

"
7 july 2017,libra,"You may have been dealing with self doubts over the past few days (or weeks!), but a positive Mercury aspect helps put them in perspective. And considering that Venus is now in your mind-expanding ninth house of possibilities, it’s all systems go.

"
7 july 2016,libra,"Something is going to happen today with your career that will make you question what’s going on. You’re in a highly ambitious phase, thanks to hosting beneficial planets in your house of ambition. But shadowy Pluto is acting up, bringing up issues about job security or the strength of a business partnership. This little storm will pass quickly, and by tomorrow you’ll have more insight.

"
8 july 2017,libra,"Your focus will shift away from work responsibilities to more personal matters, due to tonight’s full moon in Capricorn. If you haven’t been spending enough time with loved ones (or enjoying personal down time), the grind may be getting to you. This is also an excellent time to make long range plans: looking for a new place to live, starting a family, committing to a lover or helping your parents with estate planning.

"
8 july 2016,libra,"Some of the greatest scientific discoveries and inventions of all time have been discovered by people who had an odd dream or a funny hunch. What put these folks in the history books is that they act on their intuitive hits. And your  intuition should be off the charts today, thanks to lucky Jupiter stirring up your subconscious mind. You have the opportunity to advance your career and ambitions in quite a powerful way!

"
9 july 2017,libra,"You may be questioning some of your biggest dreams and plans as the Moon glides through one of the most emotional part of your chart. But don’t make any snap decisions, as this energy will continue over the next two weeks. One of the smartest things you can do right now is to find a mentor or mastermind group, something that can really take off after the 20th.

"
9 july 2016,libra,"Our thoughts create our emotions, which lead to our actions, thus in turn affecting our reality. A meet up between the impassioned Moon and advantageous Jupiter allows you to work through thought patterns that may be holding you back. With logical Saturn in your intelligence sector, you’ll be able to make sense of things–and then make progress.

"
10 july 2017,libra,"Boundaries, people! You may need to set them with your closest connections as a Sun-Pluto smackdown creates tension. If folks are butting in with unwanted opinions, or they’re trying to get their own way, it’s time to let them know under no uncertain terms that you have a mind–and a life–of your own.

"
10 july 2016,libra,"People in positions of authority will be more willing than usual to hear what you have to say, Libra. This is not the time to sit back and hope that your “luck turns” or that the cavalry is going to ride in and save you. Stick your neck out and let power brokers know that you’ve got talent.

"
11 july 2017,libra,"You may be in the mood to pamper yourself, thanks to the luscious Moon gliding through your fifth house of the luxe life. And why not? The Sun and Mars have been charging through your ambition sector, pushing you to achieve. What’s the point of working hard if you can’t reward yourself now and then?

"
11 july 2016,libra,"Career matters could hit a snag as someone in your circle throws a monkey wrench into the works. It could be a colleague, manager or even a spouse who isn’t in agreement with the way you think that things should be done. While talkative Mercury is in your house of authority, sharpening your intellect, others may not see the value in your ideas. When Venus changes signs tomorrow, there should be a shift toward more teamwork.

"
12 july 2017,libra,"Being able to see both sides of an argument or situation is the specialty of your sign, and today your vision will be even more crystal clear. You’ll be able to use this energy to figure out the next smart step for your life, so take an objective view of the path ahead.

"
12 july 2016,libra,"It’s time to take your day dreams (and dare I say fantasies!) and turn them into reality. Lucky Venus enters Leo, your eleventh house of hopes and wishes. Whereas going after your passions often can feel like an uphill battle, Venus’s job is to make things flow more smoothly. This doesn’t mean that you won’t have to expend effort, but that doors should open more easily and there should be fewer roadblocks in your path. Chances are that you won’t be traveling down this road by yourself. Teamwork, friends, and networking are all highlighted in the weeks ahead.

"
13 july 2017,libra,"Inspiration strikes today. Or is the cosmos giving you a good swift kick in the butt? That’s because Neptune and the Moon meet up in your fitness sector, pushing you off the couch and onto the jogging path. Or the elliptical machine. Or the pool. There’s no need to join an expensive gym: with the recent full moon in your domestic sector, at-home workouts (or the “head out the front door” type) are the best way to go.

"
13 july 2016,libra,"Sometimes the planets tell you that flying solo is the way to go, but that’s not the case for you right now, Libra. Mercury’s entry into your friendly eleventh house of networking means that the time is ripe for meeting as many new faces as you can. Regardless as to whether you’re a stay at home mom, a CEO or a budding artist, the connections you make over the next five weeks could bring both enjoyment and advancement into your life. When people come together for a common purpose, great things can happen.

"
14 july 2017,libra,"It pays these days to make a good impression on others, Libra–even if you don’t feel like it! Fortunately you should  be open to networking and being diplomatic, thanks to a positive Mercury-Jupiter aspect. You have the goods…now it’s time to show them off.

"
14 july 2016,libra,"A frank exchange is necessary when it comes to your serious relationships, be they personal or business. Planetary influences suggest that you’re looking for more security, but pushing too hard for it may work against you. Slow down, soften your words, be remain honest and open for maximum results.

"
15 july 2017,libra,"If you want to move up in the world, you’ll need to impress decision makers and other muckety mucks. A stellar Moon-Mars aspect will help you come up with a plan to do so. Hint: showing how efficient and organized you are is the way to go.

"
15 july 2016,libra,"Got something on your mind? Then get it out! Whether it’s an opinion or concern that you need to share with someone close, a brainstorm for a new business, or some brilliant new thoughts for your thesis, let them flow. Write, blog, discuss, draw, or videotape. A superb Moon-Saturn meeting in your intelligent third house of expression suggests that your actions will have positive long-term effects.

"
16 july 2017,libra,"Don’t tread on me! While you’re willing to be a team player, you’re not  willing to be pushed around by someone. And anyone who gets bossy with you will find that out the hard way. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself.

"
16 july 2016,libra,"Your career is in the planet’s spotlight these days, and a terrific Mars-Sun trine indicates that more money could be coming your way. But it’s more than just cold, hard cash–a long-held dream of yours may be within your grasp. You’ve worked hard to get where you are and now it’s payback time.

"
17 july 2017,libra,"Power plays dominate the office today, so get ready for some intense drama! This energy will be at play over the next week, so patience will definitely be a virtue. This is not a good time to make big decisions, piss off decision makers or lose it with a colleague. Keep calm and carry on.

"
17 july 2016,libra,"Just what do you need to feel secure? A million dollars in the bank? A lover who’s true? A week without any drama whatsoever? We all have different standards when it comes to this topic, so consider what “security” means to you. As the Moon enters this part of your chart you’ll become more reflective, and by the time of Tuesday’s full moon you may make some big decisions that will add to your feeling of surety.

"
18 july 2017,libra,"Don’t be surprised if people start to look at you in a different way. Sometimes it takes lesser mortals awhile to catch up to someone who has a unique vision, a happier attitude or the desire to live life on bolder terms. You’ve got the goods and others are starting to notice.

"
18 july 2016,libra,"Your happiness at home is the focus of the planets these days, whether you live alone or with a big family. Today’s Pluto-Moon connection is encouraging you to identify what’s broken and needs to be fixed, and I’m not referring to the plumbing! Is there ease, balance, beauty and serenity at home and in your family? If not, you need to start addressing the problem people and the dramas they’re causing.

"
19 july 2017,libra,"Long term commitments of all kinds are favored, whether you’re planning to go to graduate school, get married or enter into an entrepreneurial venture with some partners. Today is super for discussions and strategizing.

19 july 2016,libra,"The full moon in Capricorn is a winner for making progress on the home front. Whether you’re considering buying, selling, renting or decorating, it’s time to make a decision. The same holds true for finally  closing out domestic dramas that are well past their sell-by date. Your SO may not be on board with your plans right away due to a tense angle from Uranus. Revisit things with your amour on the 27th for better results.

"
20 july 2017,libra,"Team time! Assertive Mars enters Leo, your eleventh house of collaborations and camaraderie. Consider networking at industry events to find a new job. Let a friend play matchmaker. Put your heart and time into a worthy cause by joining a charitable organization.

"
20 july 2016,libra,"Who out there wants more love in their life? Funny, I don’t hear a single Libra, single or attached, saying “Not me!”  And that’s a good thing, because a glorious Saturn-Venus trine is working double overtime to bring more amour your way. Singles, your best bet under current planetary influences is to join a group, network, go online or have a friend introduce you to a new flame. Committed Libras need to open the lines of communication with their partner and create more of a team environment.

"
21 july 2017,libra,"Despite the fact that Mars entered your teamwork sector yesterday, don’t expect people to be cooperative today. A Sun-Uranus square will bring out the egos as folks vie for position and power. Over the next four weeks you should think about who needs to remain on Team Libra–and who has to go.

"
21 july 2016,libra,"Benevolent Jupiter has been stationed in your house of the subconscious mind for close to a year now, aiming to soothe your tired mind and bring you more serenity. Today the cosmos asks you to reconsider your attitudes, fears, values and concerns about love. Be honest and look for areas where you may be tripping yourself up–then release old patterns.

"
22 july 2017,libra,"Sun in Leo highlights key collaborations over the next four weeks. Join forces with others for a good cause and be the change the world needs to see. Rub elbows with movers and shakers in your industry. Call the tribe and plan a major party. This is no time to hide out at home!

"
22 july 2016,libra,"Get ready for some serious mingling, Libra! The Sun has entered Leo, your eleventh house of networking and camaraderie. The next four weeks are super for joining a think tank, attending industry events, meeting a new romantic partner through a singles group, or making changes in your town via a neighborhood association. It’s also a wonderful time to lend a hand to a charity or good cause.

"
23 july 2017,libra,"Rebellious streak? Or is it a taste of independence you’re after? Today’s new moon falls in your house of friends and camaraderie, which bodes well for socializing and meeting people. But Uranus is in a harsh spot, indicating that someone close may not share your desire to schmooze and mingle. Maybe you need a little space.

"
23 july 2016,libra,"Neptune has been backstroking through your house of work for awhile now, possibly creating confusion at your end. But retrograde periods serve a purpose. They help us reflect upon what’s working and what’s not in our lives. You could be questioning whether you’re in the right line of work, or if your current employer is the best fit for you. Doubts about clients, colleagues and protocols could be running through your mind. A Moon-Neptune connection today could find you ruminating about these topics. When Mercury goes retro on the 30th, you’ll be able to figure out your next move.

"
24 july 2017,libra,"Telling it like it is is crucial over the next few days–the question is, are others being as open as you are? Don’t read too much into what others are saying; let them reveal what they’re really thinking and planning to do next.

"
24 july 2016,libra,"Now that the Sun is in the house of your deepest wishes, chances are your thoughts are turning to romance. If that’s the case, you’re in luck. A happy Moon-Sun trine helps you focus on your desires, perhaps even to manifest them! It’s not enough to dream–take some action.

"
25 july 2017,libra,"Start becoming more selective about the people you associate with. Seek advice and friendship from mentors and pals who know you best and have your interests at heart. You don’t need a lot of “likes” in your personal life! In this Facebook world, many people feel the need to accumulate contacts. Quality over quantity, my friend.

"
25 july 2016,libra,"Your sign is known for being the best at handling committed partnerships, but with Uranus going retrograde on Friday in this part of the sky you might be thinking twice about romance. For the past week planetary aspects have been asking you just how content and secure you feel in your relationship. Singles may be considering what kind of guarantees they need from a prospective lover. Today’s Moon-Pluto square will stir up these thoughts; pay attention.

"
26 july 2017,libra,"A sizzling Mars-Sun aspect is perfect for creating a powerful team, or taking one that you’re already in to a higher level. You may need to be at the helm, or at the least provide the group with some direction. In addition, any kind of tech venture initiated within the next 48 hours can pay off handsomely–and that includes online dating!

"
26 july 2016,libra,"With the passionate Moon in the most emotional part of your chart, feelings may arise that perhaps you had forgotten about long ago. La Luna makes a superb angle to transformational Pluto, helping you release the past for a far better tomorrow. A deeper sense of contentment will result.

"
27 july 2017,libra,"Hello, Moon! La Luna is doing you the honor of entering your sign for the next few days, so soak up its passionate energy. This is an excellent time for you to be out mingling with others– start texting your BFFs and make plans. You never know just who they might introduce you to.

"
27 july 2016,libra,"Don’t be surprised if people are clamoring to be on Team Libra these days! You have something going for you that others find attractive, whether it’s charisma, business sense or some terrific ideas. But with Uranus heading retrograde on Friday in your partnership sector, be careful of the bonds you forge. Stick with the best.

"
28 july 2017,libra,"Don’t be surprised if you feel that you’re looking out for your own best interests these days–the Moon is now in your sign, and it’s high-fiving abundant Jupiter. Don’t worry, you won’t be selfish about this. The key is to surround yourself with people who share the same values, and if you do that, naturally there will be less friction.

"
28 july 2016,libra,"Current planetary influences indicate that you’re anxious for more security in all areas of your life. So why do you feel so restless? The Taurus moon is stirring up thoughts of indulging yourself and perhaps throwing a little caution to the wind. No problem there. Cut loose and enjoy the day without the incessant thoughts of where you’re going next.

"
29 july 2017,libra,"Close relationships might be all over the place this weekend as conflicting aspects arise. Today is not a good time for spontaneous activities or talks. Stick to the tried and true today and don’t rock the boat.

"
29 july 2016,libra,"“Where is this relationship heading?” That famous line will be in abundance among Libras now that erratic Uranus has gone retrograde in your commitment sector. Uranus loves to look at the future, and if you can’t see a future with your amour, it may be time to move on. But happily involved Libras will enjoy this period, as it encourages you to spend more face time (and less tech time) with your partner. This is the planet of digital toys, so put ’em away.

"
30 july 2017,libra,"A playful mood is in the air with charismatic Venus winking at spontaneous Uranus is the heavens. Therefore, the cosmos authorizes you to flirt, party, go to the beach or have fun with your honey. No honey in sight? Then start looking, because Uranus is in your house of commitment.

"
30 july 2016,libra,"One of the biggest issues with trusting that your intuition is on target is just that: trust, or faith. Get ready for a highly intuitive time ahead now that intelligent Mercury is in the house of the subconscious mind. Mercury is pragmatic and keeps things real, so if your gut is telling you something, chances are good that it’s right on target. Incisive Mercury will also help you get to the root of fears, worries and other negative thought patterns. Release and move on.

"
31 july 2017,libra,"Got #goals? Then you’re in luck as planet of ease, Venus, glides into your ambition sector. Whether you’re trying to land a new lover or a job, lose weight or gain new friends, the next three weeks are perfect for achieving this–without a lot of sweat.

"
31 july 2016,libra,"Hmmm, someone’s feeling their oats! Libra is known for being the sign of cooperation, but there’s a difference between working with others and relinquishing control. Taking over the reins may be in your best interest today. Let others know what expectations you have of them, and if you need to lay down a new protocol, so be it.

"
1 august 2017,libra,"Hold out for the best, whether it’s in your career or love. Take your time and consider what’s currently on offer. You may be able to do better, and next week’s eclipse in the most creative part of your chart could point out new options that you’ve never considered–or been exposed to.

"
1 august 2016,libra,"Power to the tribe! Your friends are going to be a much bigger part of your life in the weeks to come, and today, two happy trines involve your closest acquaintances. A pal could introduce you to a new amour, ask you to join a club or industry group, or just invite you out for a good time. There’s a lucky vibe surrounding this, by the way! You never know what may come out of a chance encounter.

"
2 august 2017,libra,"Say what you mean and mean what you say! There’s no room for ambiguity today in any area of your life. You don’t have to beat anyone over the head, though–just be authoritative in a calm manner. You’ll get your point across.

"
2 august 2016,libra,"Go tell it from the mountain! What a day to speak your mind or engage in some shameless self-promotion. First, self-confident Mars barrels into your house of communication for a nice long stay. It is accompanied by a new moon in the house of networking, technology, making new contacts and big plans. Got a message to get across–to your kids, a lover, friends or the entire world? Don’t hold back!

"
3 august 2017,libra,"Partnerships of all kinds will experience erratic patterns now that Uranus has gone retrograde in the sector that governs them. Speeding up, slowing down—partners flaking out—rules and roles needing to be altered. This energy will be in play until the first week of January, so patience will definitely be needed.

"
3 august 2016,libra,"While the planets are creating a more convivial atmosphere for you, encouraging you to mingle and socialize, you still need to keep your radar turned on. Not everyone is as open as you, nor do they have the same mindset, values and ethics. Have fun but don’t give away too much information to others until you feel that you really know them.

"
4 august 2016,libra,"With candid Mars turning up the heat in your talkative third house, you may feel like reaching out to everyone in your circle and enjoying a nice long chat. But planetary influences suggest that you hold some information back. Being friendly doesn’t mean that you have to divulge all of your thoughts, plans and secrets.

"
5 august 2017,libra,"We all have to work with other people, whether it’s at the office, within our family or a volunteer organization we’re a part of. From your chart it appears that some new life needs to be breathed into a team effort, not to mention rearranging roles and routines. Fortunately your creativity is running high, so seize the reins and make it happen.

"
5 august 2016,libra,"A dynamic behind-the-scenes trine between the Moon and Pluto is bolstering your determination to take more control. You want more power over your thoughts and emotions, which will help you handle your personal relationships in a more powerful way. Pluto is on a mission to put you in the driver’s seat.

"
6 august 2017,libra,"With the Moon in your house of contentment, you’re in no mood for surprises from people close to you. But that’s not going to stop them from acting up, so just roll with it. The mood shifts big time with tomorrow’s lunar eclipse, which will open up a far more enjoyable time for you.

"
6 august 2016,libra,"Just because a thought enters your mind, or an opinion, doesn’t mean that you should verbalize it. Tense angles between planets in your house of confidentiality and some in your chatty third house suggest that discretion is the greatest part of valor this weekend.

"
7 august 2017,libra,"La Luna lights up your love life with a sparking full moon eclipse in the romance sector. The next six months are highly auspicious for meeting someone new, conceiving a baby, getting engaged or deepening a bond. Attention single people (or those who are attached but looking anyway): your friends are the best source of introduction, along with networking at social events.

"
7 august 2016,libra,"You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink. Today’s Mercury-Neptune opposition suggests that no matter how concise an argument or case you present to someone, that they’re simply not going to get it. Whether it’s a friend, lover, family member or business contact, you’re going to feel like you’re talking to a wall. The issue at hand is that your intuition is sharp as a tack, along with your ability to reason. If others can’t see that, oh well…you tried to help.

"
8 august 2017,libra,"Creativity rises today, and that’s a good thing as it appears that more effort needs to be put into a work project or personal relationship before it can be deemed a success. Fortunately you’re in the mood to cooperate and people will sense it. Your like the lit candle, surrounded by moths–they can’t help but get pulled in by your light.

"
8 august 2016,libra,"It appears that you’ve been waffling back and forth on an issue that needs to be worked on; specifically, the exact process that needs to be followed in order to make things work. It doesn’t matter if it’s your diet, the redecorating project, patching up your romance or how to connect with a particular client. Today’s aspects ask you to think about how or why things haven’t been successful in the past and then change them. If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get the same tired old results.

"
9 august 2017,libra,"Getting clear about big dreams and values is paramount right now, due to both the Sun and Mars in the sector where we focus on the “big stuff”. Today is a smart time to consider what you want and where you’re heading with family and residential matters: moving, having a baby, telling nosy relatives to butt out of your business, or redecorating. Your sense of contentment is what it’s all about.

"
9 august 2016,libra,"With Venus and Mercury in the most secluded and thoughtful part of your chart, you may be quietly ruminating over your next move. The problem is that Mars is pushing you to take action. A productive Moon-Venus angle helps you create a plan, so grab a pen and some paper and spell it out, step by step.

"
10 august 2017,libra,"Despite the urge to strike out on your own, you would be wise to play nice and be a team member over the next few days. In fact, you may need to keep a close eye on people around you, and this will give you the chance to do so.

"
10 august 2016,libra,"Your relationships with others are the focus of the cosmos this week, especially family members or someone you live with. Your intuition is operating at a very high level, providing you with insight as to how to deal with them and what may be going on behind the scenes. On a positive note, this insight will be able to help you resolve matters to your liking. It’s possible that you share different ideas, values, habits or routines, but under current planetary influences a resolution is probable.

"
11 august 2017,libra,"Abundant Jupiter is in one heck of a good mood today, and this planet wants to bring more people into your world–the fun, interesting, helpful kind. It’s the weekend–get out there and meet as many new faces as you can. You never know where a connection might lead!

"
11 august 2016,libra,"With the intuitive Moon orbiting past Mars and Saturn today in your communications sector, your ability to perceive information–whether it’s coming from this plane or the spirit realm–will increase dramatically. Chances are you’ve been second guessing yourself lately, but now you’re being given a valuable gift: clarity. Use it to your advantage.

"
12 august 2017,libra,"Tread warily over the next few weeks as Mercury retrogrades in one of the most hidden parts of your chart. The good news is that your intuition will be high, pointing out people and situations that don’t seem right. The bad news is that your logical mind may reject what your gut is telling you. If in doubt, don’t rush to judgment.

"
12 august 2016,libra,"A surprising revelation could come your way about a partner, be they romantic or business. Jupiter in the house of the subconscious mind is ramping up your intuition, so this “news flash” will most likely be a realization that you  make, not a statement from the other party. The energy is positive, however, as it will allow you to readjust how you relate to and work with this individual.

"
13 august 2017,libra,"A major league solar eclipse is arriving next week in your networking sector, and some important new people could be soon entering your life. Today an auspicious Sun-Saturn trine could get this party started. If you’ve been trying to gain entry into a particular group or industry, or you’ve been looking for the right mentor, start reaching out to others right now.

"
13 august 2016,libra,"It’s time to consider what other people have to say, although no one is accusing you of being closed-minded! The reason is that Saturn goes direct in your thinking and communication sector after a five-month retrograde period. You may have withdrawn somewhat as you reconsidered plans and the way you relate to the people in your circle. A fresh new perspective may be just what’s needed in order to work well with others.

"
14 august 2017,libra,"Following your passion or bliss is always recommended by self-help gurus, but can it really be done? That question will be on your mind over the following week as your major goals and desires enter center stage. Next week’s eclipse may shake up preconceived notions, so start considering what you really want today.

"
14 august 2016,libra,"Although Saturn just went direct yesterday in your communication sector, you may be holding back from talking today and relying on your intuition instead. Over the next few days it would be wise to do so, as Venus is active in the vibey, metaphysical twelfth house. People around you, especially at work, may not be easy to read if you just try to use logic alone. You’ve got a secret weapon: use it!

"
15 august 2017,libra,"From your chart it’s obvious that you want peace and contentment. Problem is, people around you may not be coming from the same place. You can fight them if you choose, but you’ll end up stirring up way too much drama–which completely goes against what you desire. Let them be.

"
15 august 2016,libra,"This could be an emotional day as the passionate Moon swings past powerful Pluto. Past memories from your childhood could come to the fore, especially if there are unresolved issues. Carrying baggage that was dumped on you by parents or other family members doesn’t help you on your journey. Fortunately, intelligent Mercury in the house of the subconscious mind is in a place to help you reason things out.

"
16 august 2017,libra,"If you need people to back a particular idea or plan of yours, the smart way to go about it is to focus on the big picture, the end result. Yes, a big plan is made up of many small actions, but if you talk about the details you’ll lose your audience!

"
16 august 2016,libra,"Got romance on your mind? This Thursday’s full moon falls in your house of amour, so whether you’re attached or single you’ll be affected. Things could start getting interesting today, though, as a positive trine occurs between the Sun and Uranus. Singles could be introduced to someone new at a social event via an introduction. And is that platonic friend of yours really “just a friend”? Attached Libras will be considering the next important step, such as pregnancy, getting married…or moving on to greener pastures.

"
17 august 2017,libra,"Abundant, sunny Jupiter has been in your sign for almost a year now, opening your mind to a host of new possibilities. Goals that seemed impossible in the past may now be on your list of things to accomplish. But a Jupiter-Venus square today might make you feel tied down, as though you need to stick to a tired old script. Nope! Toss it.

"
17 august 2016,libra,"People around you may be more open to having meaningful discussions today, especially in your personal life. And it’s about time! Planet of ease Venus is in the house of your emotions and psyche, smoothing the way for you to communicate with serenity. Be willing to hear the opinion of someone else while explaining your own. Progress can be made.

"
18 august 2017,libra,"Confidence is sexy, and you should be looking like the most self-assured person in town. Magnetic Venus meets up with the amorous Moon today, giving you an allure that you’re gonna wish you could bottle and sell for profit. Since you can’t do that, you can at least turn some heads…and make people say, “Who is that mystery person?”

"
18 august 2016,libra,"Be still, my beating heart! Yup, expect your pulse to quicken with today’s full moon in your love sector. A new hottie could show up on the scene or an existing romance could start to pick up steam. But we’re not talking about one night stands here. A happy meeting between the Sun and Uranus in your commitment sector indicates that this is the real deal. The only warning with this lunation is to think twice about an office romance.

"
19 august 2017,libra,"Someone may challenge your authority today, and your response may be an emotional one. The Moon is in Cancer, making everyone a bit sensitive. But once it moves into Leo tomorrow a greater sense of teamwork appears for your sign. wait until then to work things out.

"
19 august 2016,libra,"You may feel cornered by an endless list of errands and chores that need to be done at home or the office with tense aspects in the sky. You run the risk of snapping at someone (blame megamouth Mars in your communication sector), so take a deep breath and count to ten before you vent. By the way, the planets indicate that it’s time for your colleagues to pick up more of the slack. Stop being the office go-to gal or guy.

"
20 august 2016,libra,"Feeling more intuitive than John Edward or the Long Island Medium? You should be! With Jupiter, Mercury and Venus in your vibey, metaphysical twelfth house your chakras should be wide open and your psychic ability off the charts. Just wait until the Sun joins them on Monday. Nobody better try to fool a Libra then. But the Moon today is making you doubt your gut feelings. Just roll with them and see what happens.

"
21 august 2016,libra,"Slow down when it comes to going through you daily routine, chores or the grind at the office. While you may be anxious to blast through everything on your list and close deals, you run the risk of overlooking key details and making a mistake. The good news, however, is that your motivation for getting things done is increasing. But your work is  observed by others, and you don’t want to deliver shoddy results.

"
22 august 2016,libra,"No sign has more going on in their brain than you, Libra! The Sun glides into Virgo today, the house of the subconscious mind. Perceptive Mercury and healing Jupiter are already there, along with serene Venus. The next few weeks are excellent for coming to grips with old issues, hurts, fears and habits that no longer serve a useful purpose. With a happy conjunction between Mercury and Jupiter, you may have an “aha!”moment in which you realize that you are bigger than your problems.

"
24 august 2016,libra,"A playful aspect between the Moon and Neptune suggests that today’s a good day to call in sick…have a liquid lunch…plan cocktails with the tribe after work (if calling in sick just isn’t going to fly)…or plan a special day in the not-too-distant future for letting your hair down. Hey, it’s 5:00 somewhere.

"
25 august 2016,libra,"Yesterday’s Mars-Saturn conjunction was all about letting you find your voice. The people in your world need to know what’s on your mind and where you stand. But be careful today of coming off as being too preachy or opinionated. Others may need time to get used to your candor and smart ideas.

"
26 august 2016,libra,"Be meticulous in word and deed today, as a Mars-Neptune square could bring about hurried, unprofessional results–on your part or the part of others. Mars is tearing through your chatty third house of the written and spoken word. Double-check contracts and written assignments and watch what you post on social media. And keep the BS meter powered on too, as someone could be trying to baffle you with it.

"
28 august 2016,libra,"Out with the old, in with the new. No, it’s not New Year’s Eve. It’s just that lovely Venus is getting ready to enter Libra on Monday, ushering in a happy phase in which you can doll yourself up and enjoy life more. But today’s cosmic energy tells you to take out some of the mental “toxic trash” that’s been building up first. You may realize that in order to live a happier life that you’ll need to take more control of certain situations.

"
29 august 2016,libra,"You may have pulled into a little cocoon over the past few weeks, thanks to five celestial orbs taking up residence in your house of rest and closure. And today you might reach a decision about something that’s important to you, even if it means cutting out certain people or circumstances from your life. No problem there! Lucky Venus glides into Libra today, blessing you with its easy-going attitude. The next month is going to be one heck of a game changer.

"
30 august 2016,libra,"You have an odd mix of planetary aspects at play, Libra. Lovely Venus just sashayed into your sign, ramping up your charisma and sex appeal as well as opening up a very social time period. But Mercury retrogrades today in your reclusive house of healing, nurturing and closure. So while part of you may want to head out and meet friends for dinner, another part may want to stay at home and meditate. Or–watch TV with a jar of Nutella in one hand and a cocktail in the other. It’s your choice.

"
31 august 2016,libra,"As tomorrow’s solar eclipse in the most cathartic part of your chart draws near, you may be thinking about the chapters of your life that need to be closed out. Mercury has just gone retrograde here, creating a little confusion  as to what to do next. But the next few weeks will find you stepping out of the shadows and into the light as Venus smooths the path ahead.

"
1 september 2016,libra,"There’s an old saying: in order to set forth on a new voyage, you have to lose sight of the shore. Truer words were never spoken, Libra, as a solar eclipse occurs today in the house of closure and moving on. You’re in a transition phase and the job of the eclipse is to point out the parts of your life that are no longer worth holding on to. This could mean habits, thought patterns, people or circumstances. When generous Jupiter enters your sign next week, a whole new chapter begins.

"
2 september 2016,libra,"There’s a highly cathartic vibe in the air as Mercury and Jupiter hold a meeting in the psychological sector of your chart. Intelligent Mercury helps you get in touch with past hurts and negative emotions as healing Jupiter cleanses your tired mind and soul. You may feel conflicted as to whether or not you should voice your feelings to those around you. If that’s the case, wait until next Wednesday, a much better time to vent.

"
3 september 2016,libra,"It could be a moody day, but you might be in the mood for love! La Luna swings past two of the most benevolent planets in our solar system, Jupiter and Venus, in your hush-hush twelfth house. Got a secret crush? Want to canoodle at home with the lights down low? Singles might be deep in thought about the kind of lover they want in their life. Next!

"
4 september 2016,libra,"Trying to put a square peg into a round hole? it’s an exercise in frustration, my friend! Today you need to take a look at situations in your life that simply aren’t flowing as easily as they should. With the Moon in a difficult angle to Pluto, change isn’t going to happen overnight. The faster you realize that the happier you’ll be. With energetic Mars in a buoyant mood in your social third house, you’re better off heading out to brunch with a friend and letting your troubles alone for the day.

"
5 september 2016,libra,"As the Moon swings through your sign today you’ll become more in tune with what is important to you. Setting priorities and fleshing out your passion projects is key this week.  Fortuitous Jupiter is scheduled to enter Libra this Friday for the first time in almost 13 years; give a lot of thought as to what you’d like to manifest in the year ahead.

"
6 september 2016,libra,"Finding more creative ways to get your work done faster should be a snap today with some helpful angles between the Moon, Neptune and Saturn. Sometimes we need to take a step back from the usual way we get things done and take a new approach. Old habits die hard, but with wise and disciplined Saturn on the case, efficient new patterns can be put into place–and then cemented.

"
7 september 2016,libra,"An emotional breakthrough can be reached today as four glorious celestial orbs help you dig deep into your subconscious and root out past problems that have troubled you. It’s time to axe these little suckers once and for all, and with a cathartic Venus-Saturn angle, communicating your thoughts is the best way to go. Whether you reach out to a trusted confidante or therapist, or just journal your emotions, the key is to release. Disciplined Saturn will provide you with the ability to stick with a happier new mindset.

"
8 september 2016,libra,"The art of self-expression is not a gift that you inherit; it can be learned. Today’s Moon-Mars-Saturn powwow helps you nail down communication skills, whether it’s the way you talk to your kids, how you design a website or learn how to be a better teacher. These skills can last a lifetime with Saturn’s powerful influence.

"
9 september 2016,libra,"Got a smug smile on your face? You should, Libra! As of today you are officially the celestial golden-haired girls and boys of the zodiac. That’s because lucky Jupiter just entered your sign where it will remain until October 11, 2017. Use Jupiter’s beneficial energy to go after just about anything your heart desires. Does this mean that it’s all going to be easy peasy? Of course not. But the initiatives you kick off today can change your life, with effects that will carry way into your future.

"
10 september 2016,libra,"Cut the fluff and tell it like it is, Libra. No-nonsense Saturn in your communication sector warns you to be frank with others today, even if they don’t like it. There’s no need to be harsh or aggressive, however. Now that Jupiter is in the house of “you”, your needs and desires will be front and center. That may rub people the wrong way, but you can’t please everyone.

"
11 september 2016,libra,"Family roles die hard, and if you have grown tired of the role you’ve been playing you may become keenly aware of it. Even past dramas from your childhood that have long been buried in your subconscious may bubble up to the surface of your mind, especially if someone else used to come down hard on you. It’s time to let it go. Now that Jupiter is in your sign, your needs are front and center.

"
12 september 2016,libra,"A powerful meeting between the authoritative Sun and intelligent Mercury allows you to pinpoint the garbage in your life that simply must go! Whether it’s negative thought patterns, bad habits or lots o’ crap coming from others, it’s time to kick it to the curb. With the most optimistic planet in our solar system, Jupiter, now in your sign, you won’t want anything holding you back.

"
13 september 2016,libra,"In a reflective mood? You might be considering that Mercury is retrograde in your house of the mind, which includes the subconscious. A recent meeting between the Sun and Mercury was designed to shed some light on the past, the present and where you’re headed in the future, in all  areas of your life. This Friday’s lunar eclipse in Pisces could be the motivating force that kicks you into action on some new endeavors.

"
14 september 2016,libra,"Now that abundant Jupiter is in your sign, you should start to feel a little more optimistic about the future. Today, a happy meeting between the Moon and maverick Uranus could suddenly inspire you to reach out to people around you and plan some social get togethers. With this Friday’s lunar eclipse taking place in your fitness sector, hooking up with a jogging partner or taking a class at the gym could be a great way to get in shape and make new friends.

"
15 september 2016,libra,"Some unexpected news could come your way at work, as someone may be interested in partnering with you. Or perhaps it’s a new customer who has heard about your reputation and wants to talk about what you can do for them. But don’t wait for business to come to you. You should definitely be promoting yourself these days with Mars in the communication sector.

"
17 september 2016,libra,"Go yell it from the mountain! Bold Mars in your house of communication forms an energetic, harmonious angle today with surprise-a-minute Uranus. What a day to speak your mind—with a lover, friend, business partner, potential investor, spouse or an expert who can help move your career along. There’s a spontaneous vibe going on here, so don’t be surprised if someone (and that includes you!) gets the ball rolling in a happy new way.

"
18 september 2016,libra,"Just how much freedom do you need when it comes to the people around you? A Venus-Uranus opposition today may suddenly find you craving more alone time. This isn’t surprising considering that Jupiter just entered your sign not too long ago. And when the Sun enters Libra on Thursday, you may demand more independence.

"
19 september 2016,libra,"What a wonderful week ahead for self-expression! Mars is making you  the person to listen to, so don’t hold back. Today magnetic Venus forms a glorious angle with Mars. Pitch an idea, schedule an interview, ask someone out on a date, hit the lecture circuit, sign up for Photoshop or Illustrator classes, or start writing a manuscript. You can’t go wrong.

"
20 september 2016,libra,"It’s almost birthday time, Libra, which means that it’s time to clear the decks of old stuff that has become boring, irrelevant, or not in your best interest. A super trine today between intelligent Mercury in the house of closure with transformative Pluto is perfect for self reflection. The goal is to become more confident and to feel more secure about your future.

"
22 september 2016,libra,"Happy birthday Libra! The Sun enters your sign today, crowning you the celestial favorite for the next four weeks. This year will be different than those of the past, as lucky Jupiter happens to be in your house for the first time in over a decade. With the Moon in Taurus, you should be setting your sights higher than ever.

"
23 september 2016,libra,"Lucky Jupiter is blessing your sign for the next year, but that doesn’t mean that every day will be rosy! Someone could be throwing their weight around today, such as your boss or lover. The Moon in Cancer might encourage you to respond with a crabby attitude (no pun intended), but let this little drama pass. A Sun-Jupiter conjunction on Monday in Libra puts you in control.

"
24 september 2016,libra,"The cosmos is determined that you live a more contented lifestyle, and that often means getting rid of negative thought patterns. A happy and harmonious trine between Mercury and Pluto will allow you to do just that.  Got “daddy issues” from the past, or problems that have to do with authority figures? Work on those first.

"
25 september 2016,libra,"Stellar day for making new friends, meeting a potential mate or developing business contacts! The Moon in Leo could bring in fortuitous connections that could make your life take a different turn. This is not  a day to stay locked up at home, unless you’re reaching out to fresh new acquaintances online.

"
26 september 2016,libra,"Well, well, well, ain’t you somethin’ special. The Sun and lucky Jupiter are holding a powwow today in your sign, Libra! And they’ve decided to grant you a few wishes, kind of like Aladdin. However, the genie delivered the goods to our boy Alladin without him having to exert any effort. In your case, the cosmos has your back in a big way, but you’re going to have to put in some grunt work. That being said, today is one of the best days for your sign in over a decade for making your wishes come true.

"
27 september 2016,libra,"With so much planetary activity taking place in your sign, you may be wondering where to start or what to focus on. You might want to take a look at domestic matters first, such as your residence or the dynamic between family members. Red hot Mars is now in this part of your chart, encouraging you to clean, organize, move, buy, sell, or work things out with your loved ones. With powerful Pluto there also, the next seven weeks can be productive indeed.

"
28 september 2016,libra,"If your gut tells you today that you should do something, pay attention! A powerful Moon-Mercury meet-up could bring wisdom your way from the other realms, and it’s something that could put you in a good position. This kind of cosmic guidance doesn’t show up every day so use it to your advantage, with one caveat: don’t discuss your ideas with others, especially at the office.

"
29 september 2016,libra,"A person close to you may act in an erratic manner today, and the best thing you can do is to quietly take things in without becoming too emotional. You have an advantage as the vibey Moon is in your house of intuition, enabling you to suss what’s going on with this individual. Another way this could play out is that you sense a shift with someone who’s acting like their usual self. If that’s the case, sniff out the truth.

"
30 september 2016,libra,"If you are looking to land a new gig or a bigger paycheck, this weekend’s Neptune-Venus trine will certainly help. But you can get the ball rolling today as a happy Moon-Jupiter conjunction shines its spotlight on your personality and talent. Don’t hold back!

"
1 october 2016,libra,"Even if you’ve already celebrated your birthday, Libra, go out and buy another cake. Then put some candles on it and make a BIG wish, as the cosmos delivers a happy new moon in your sign today. Over the next six months you can initiate just about anything your heart desires, from finding new love to losing weight to patenting an invention. You name it, the opportunity is there. Does this mean that goodies will be dropped into your lap? No, you’ll have to work for them. But you can make terrific headway in the months ahead.

"
2 october 2016,libra,"Yesterday’s new moon in your sign is the perfect opportunity to kick off new initiatives, and what’s better still is that inspirational Neptune is in a terrific angle to help you. The key is to establish habits and routines that become so automatic that you just keep doing the right things day after day, until one day you wake up and realize that you’re living a different kind of life.

"
3 october 2016,libra,"You’ll be able to sell ice cream to Eskimos in the days ahead, thanks to a savvy angle between the Sun and Saturn. But make sure you think things through, as Saturn is determined to take whatever you set in motion and turn it into a long-term affair.

"
4 october 2016,libra,"You may discover that you’re expressing yourself in more sophisticated, mature ways these days.

Today the ringed planet forms a gorgeous angle with the Sun, perfect for hitting upon a smart idea that can take a dream and tune it into a firm reality.

"
5 october 2016,libra,"If there have been any unresolved issues with a spouse, family member, landlord, roommate or even an ex, you would be advised to take care of them as best you can today. The Sun in Libra is trying to put you in the driver’s seat so that you can maintain some degree of control. Pluto, however, will be acting up later in the week, meaning that someone will be acting out, trying to manipulate matters or become downright dictatorial. Start maneuvering now!

"
6 october 2016,libra,"Don’t kid yourself. That’s the message from the cosmos as Jupiter’s optimism may cloud your vision today and tomorrow. Whether it’s about love, your kids, the house, your ex—keep it real. Someone may be trying to push your buttons or push you to follow a certain course of action. Rely on rational thought more than emotion to make the right decisions.

"
7 october 2016,libra,"If you enjoy being a doormat, then you’re gonna love the tense Sun-Pluto square today. Someone may be critical or dismissive of your feelings. A family member especially could act out, sticking their nose in your private business. But since most of you aren’t willing to be run over by anyone, here’s the good news: intelligent, quick thinking Mercury enters Libra today, your house of self-esteem. It’s time to stick up for yourself and present your ideas to people who count.

"
8 october 2016,libra,"If there have been issues at home or with family members, today’s aspects bring some helpful, healing energy.

But try to work things out, as inspirational Neptune is interested in seeing that you lead a happy, stress-free life at home.

"
9 october 2016,libra,"Streamlining your routines at home and work can have a big payoff. Right now Venus is cruising through your second house, which not only governs habits and scheduling but also earning power. And  Venus is one of two planets that brings profits your way. Take the time to create new protocols–they could be money in the bank.

"
10 october 2016,libra,"A burst of creative energy could come your way as the Moon in the most innovative part of your chart forms a terrific angle with Jupiter and Mercury. Whether you’re a stay-at-home mom or work in a field that you may feel is not “artistic”, this planetary aspect is super for polishing up your skills–helping your kids with their homework, becoming a better speaker in meetings, or coming up with fresh solutions no one has thought of before.

"
11 october 2016,libra,"Go out tonight and wish upon a star! Wish on two “stars” actually—Mercury and Jupiter, glittering like stars right next to each other in the heavens. These two optimistic, generous planets meet in your sign, a good omen as it will open your mind to possibilities that you may not have considered before. But under current planetary influences it appears that people in your circle may not be over the moon with your new plans and bright ideas. Should you soldier on without them? Maybe. Next week’s full moon in Aries will help you make that decision.

"
12 october 2016,libra,"Say what you mean and mean what you say. Putting your foot down may be necessary over the next week as family members, lovers and work colleagues may try to push their own agenda on you. With the Sun and Mercury in Libra you will be able to state your case with authority and eloquence. Whether others listen or not is another story!

"
14 october 2016,libra,"Thinking about taking a class, either for fun or to increase your earning power? Today’s a good time to study the course offerings at a nearby or online school. With smart-as-a-whip Mercury in Libra forming a super aspect with disciplined Saturn, you have the chops to take a course and rock it.

"
15 october 2016,libra,"Who’s running the show? I’m referring to your life! This may be in the forefront of your mind as recent planetary aspects have made people around you on the demanding side. It’s all well and good to be kind to others and help them out, but if your generosity of spirit is unappreciated or being taken for granted it may be time to let them know that the party is over. And you’ll have that opportunity in the days ahead, as tomorrow’s full moon will shake things up.

"
16 october 2016,libra,"It’s your needs versus a partner’s as a full moon takes place in your house of commitment. Rebellious Uranus is active, possibly stirring up your desire for some independence. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll split up. But chances are you’ll ask for space, demand that more needs of yours are being met or expect the other party to pull their own weight.

"
17 october 2016,libra,"The energy of yesterday’s full moon is still in play, which means that you should get down to the nitty gritty when it comes to your closest relationships. A helpful aspect between the emotional Moon and subterranean Pluto will permit you to hold some meaningful discussions in the days ahead. As both of these are in houses that deal with your sense of security, it’s wise to make progress right now.

"
18 october 2016,libra,"The planets are creating a bit of a conundrum for you. How focused should you be on your own goals, desires and needs? And how much should you be enabling, caring for or putting up with other people? Sweet talking Venus enters your candid third house of communication today for a three-week stay. If in doubt, talk it out.

"
19 october 2016,libra,"Maintaining emotional equilibrium is important to most people. After all, there are entire industries dedicated to it: psychotherapy, counseling, the New Age stuff and all those self-improvement books and courses. Strong forces in the cosmos could be dredging up old emotions and dramas as Mars and Pluto meet in the heavens. This could be difficult as it may make you feel off balance, but it’s actually designed to help you step into your own power. If you need help, seek it. Otherwise, get rid of past demons on your own. With so much positive planetary activity going on in your sign, the forecast for the future is happy with a good deal of contentment.

"
20 october 2016,libra,"My way or the highway? This theme may have come up last Sunday with the Aries full moon. And now it’s ba-a-a-a-ck! You may be craving independence from the demands of others, whether it’s your boss, family, friends or other commitments. Someone may be trying to push you into following their agenda, which ain’t gonna fly. Not with all of the planets in your first house of self-esteem telling you to stick up for yourself!

"
21 october 2016,libra,"With the emotional Moon in your house of authority, you may feel today that you’ve lost control of a situation, or that there are too many outside circumstances influencing your life. The full moon in Aries last Sunday may have brought up issues concerning your closest relationships, for starters. With the Sun just about ready to enter your structured second house, you’ll be able to regain control, but you may have to create new habits and routines in order to feel more secure.

"
22 october 2016,libra,"This is one of the best times in 2016 to score more dinero, Scorpio! The mighty Sun has just entered Scorpio, your house of earned income and savings. Intelligent Mercury, planet of negotiation and brainstorming, joins El Sol on Monday, and there’s a sparkling new moon here on the 30th. So start making plans, whether you decide to look for a new job, climb the ladder where you are now or to develop your own company’s revenues. Creating a workable budget is also suggested in the weeks ahead, along with a more defined savings plan.

"
23 october 2016,libra,"With the two most inspirational planets, Jupiter and Neptune, in your house of fitness and health in a good angle, you should be feeling optimistic about your future vitality and body tone. But you may need to adjust something—your diet, medication, or workout regimen under the current planetary aspects. Whether you need to push harder or maybe slow down a bit is your decision to make. Listen to your body; it won’t steer you wrong.

"
24 october 2016,libra,"Interested in earning more money? Who isn’t? You’re in luck, Libra, as intelligent Mercury, planet of negotiation enters your second house of income and savings today.  Get your feelers out there. Ask for the order, the raise, the responsibility, or the job. Brainstorm ways to earn more. What many folks don’t know is that Venus is one of two planets that govern profitability, so now is an awesome time to make progress on the financial front.

"
25 october 2016,libra,"Are you walking the walk and talking the talk? For that matter, are the people around you doing the same? A difficult aspect between Neptune and Venus warns that it’s imperative to follow through on promises, whether at work, at home or just getting your chores done. Since you can’t control what other people do, focus on your own actions and deeds. Be impeccable.

"
26 october 2016,libra,"With abundant Jupiter finally in your first house of self-esteem after a 12-year hiatus, feeling good in your own mind, and looking good in the eyes of others, should be a lot easier. And a happy angle between Venus and Jupiter today allows you to shine. Reach out to others, self-promote, and and even consider taking a class under this aspect.

"
27 october 2016,libra,"Money talks! And that’s what you should be doing today—talking about making (or saving) mo’ money. A brilliant conjunction between the Sun and intelligent Mercury in your income sector is prodding you to hunt down more of the green stuff—and then bank it. Ask for a raise, look for another job, review your budget, cut expenses, shop for better yields on investments, or start a business. You’ll have the ambition and the smarts to make it happen under this aspect.

"
28 october 2016,libra,"Tired of being the good old dependable you? It’s not your lot in life to be available to everyone 24/7, Libra. A spunky meeting between the Moon and Jupiter in your sign could light a fire under you to do your own thing just this once. With Mars in your house of domesticity and family affairs you may feel obliged to be the responsible person who needs to get things done, but for heaven’s sake—take a break already!

"
29 october 2016,libra,"What you say and how you say it are of critical importance with a standoff between the two most combustible planets in the solar system, Mars and Uranus. However, this doesn’t mean that you should sit there in silence and not express your opinion. Indeed, with stern Saturn on the scene it would be wise to lay down some rules and boundaries at home and in relationships, be they personal or business. Gentle Venus will help you get your point across with diplomacy.

"
30 october 2016,libra,"Every year each sign enjoys a new moon in their income sector, and your’s is today. Since this is the best time to plant new “seeds”, in a manner of speaking, it’s wise to do whatever you can in the weeks ahead to boost your income and increase your savings. What makes this year’s new moon different from past ones, however, is that lucky Venus is only two fortunate degrees away from La Luna. Venus governs profits, and inspirational Neptune also happens to be in a winning angle. Money-making ideas should flow–pay attention!

"
31 october 2016,libra,"Take your time when it comes to considering a proposal, idea, contract or partnership; don’t feel rushed into making a decision. That’s because serious Saturn is involved, indicating that decisions you make today will have a big effect for a long time to come. Yesterday’s new moon may be making you long for security or a routine, but make sure that you’re heading in the right direction first.

"
1 november 2016,libra,"Your prospects for earning (and therefore saving) more money are rising, Libra, and you may understand that better today. A helpful Sun-Neptune angle clears up past questions and confusion about which direction to head in with your career, a problem at the office or how to pitch to a prospective client. In order to think and act more creatively in the future you may need to hire new staff, add a better service provider or change your methods. Do so and witness more green in the months ahead.

"
2 november 2016,libra,"Hey there, butterfly. Don’t you think it’s time to be more social? With the Moon swinging past Venus in your communication sector, you should be reaching out to people and making plans. Yes, duty calls, thanks to hosting the Sun in your house of making money and getting things done. But you need some face time with people who aren’t co-workers or other moms. Try to make some new friends as Saturn’s presence indicates that they could be in your life for years to come.

"
3 november 2016,libra,"Your home environment has been a big focus of the cosmos lately and you would be wise to pay attention. Take charge of domestic matters and dramas before they get out of hand, a good possibility around Thanksgiving. No one wants problems at holiday time, and with commanding Pluto in your house of family you can and should take control. But this doesn’t mean that you have to clobber people over the head. Smooth talking Venus enters this sector on the 9th, enabling you to smooth ruffled feathers with ease.

"
4 november 2016,libra,"With smart little Mercury in your house of routines and security, you should be yearning for consistency and shared responsibility when it comes to the people you deal with on a regular basis. But are they coming from the same place? The only way to find out is to talk things over with them. Don’t play mind reader and make assumptions.

"
5 november 2016,libra,"Time to balance the budget? Take a good long look at your finances today to make sure that you’re on the right track when it comes to saving and spending. This is especially true if you share your finances with a partner or are self-employed. The cosmos is suggesting that you or a partner may be feeling impulsive about spending, which needs to be addressed before it gets out of hand.

"
6 november 2016,libra,"A topic may come up quite suddenly between you and someone close, something that you weren’t expecting to discuss today. This is good news, however, as Venus is involved and wants to smooth the path ahead. Whatever you do, don’t hold back your ideas, feelings or emotions. In the weeks ahead you’ll be able to share your thoughts with many others and make progress along the way.

"
7 november 2016,libra,"Wrap up matters that have to deal with your home base before Wednesday, when Mars moves on to a much lighter place. If family members have been difficult to deal with, remind them who’s the boss today. Routines, rules and boundaries need to be respected. You should be able to get the message across with confidence, and make sure you hold them to it.

"
8 november 2016,libra,"You certainly will be interested in having fun in the weeks ahead, but the cosmos warns that you need to start saving more money. This is especially true when it comes to spending on luxury items that you don’t need right now or the latest fad for the kids. Next week’s full moon in Taurus will make it clear that mindless spending has to come to an end. Over the next six months make a commitment to only buy essentials.

"
9 november 2016,libra,"It’s time to focus on the sweeter side of life, Libra! Romantic evenings out, spending time on hobbies, playing with your kids, trying new restaurants and going to cultural venues all count. So does jazzing up your looks—and your home decor—with chic new accoutrements. Mars has just entered your frisky fifth house of love, glamour and creativity. Artistic Libras can make big progress with their skill level and self-promotion, especially after Mercury enters your communication sector on Saturday. Strut your stuff!

"
10 november 2016,libra,"It may sound counterintuitive that you need to do more planning when it comes to enjoying life, as most people view relaxing as something that should just “flow”. But t seems that you may have gotten into an “entertainment rut”, doing the same old thing over and over again. It’s a big world out there, Libra, with a plethora of sports, hobbies and cultural activities to partake in. A Moon-Neptune meet-up tells you to research your weekend plans in advance and to try a few new things.

"
11 november 2016,libra,"Start trawling the design and lifestyle blogs, Libra! Now that Venus is in your domestic sector it’s time to turn your place into a comfortable haven. Indeed, Mars just entered your creativity zone a few days ago, so start experimenting with new recipes, do it yourself projects and decorating around the house. Keep an eye on expenses, though, as next week’s full moon is all about building your savings and investments.

"
12 november 2016,libra,"This is no time to suffer in silence! Now that candid Mercury has moved into the relating part of your chart it’s imperative to let others know what’s going on in your mind. Not only that, be bold. That person you’ve been crushing on? Ask them out. Ask for the order, the business deal, the commitment. You don’t ask, you don’t get.

"
13 november 2016,libra,"Say what you mean, and mean what you say. A strong Jupiter-Saturn connection will help you get your point across. Not only that, any boundaries or rules that you establish with others will hold. They may have to find out the hard way that you mean business.

"
14 november 2016,libra,"Your financial future reaches a major turning point today, thanks to a megawatt full moon in Taurus. While it’s possible that a windfall could come your way–or a court award, overdue child support, stock dividend–it’s more likely that you will be the driving force behind increasing your net worth. Now is an excellent time to consider becoming a business owner or entering into a joint venture of some kind. Your creativity should be through the roof due to Mars’s influence, but you may have to overcome nervous feelings of stretching past your comfort zone.
 

"
15 november 2016,libra,"With so much planetary activity pushing your skills to the fore and encouraging you to express your innovative ideas, you really can’t go wrong, Libra! The only issue is that Neptune is retrograde in your house of blue sky thinking, perhaps making you unsure about whether some of your plans are actually do-able. They are, something you’ll discover when Neptune goes direct this Saturday.

"
16 november 2016,libra,"La Luna is encouraging you to live outside of your usual comfort zone, but the Sun is demanding fiscal responsibility along with emotional maturity. But that’s OK—you can pull this off! Simply decide to take a small risk, something that doesn’t put you in the hole financially. You may be surprised to discover that a pal or lover wants to be your “partner in crime”, in a manner of speaking. You only live once.

"
18 november 2016,libra,"Feel like being a doormat? Want to do all the grunt work while others around you slack off? If the answer to these questions is “yes” then get ready to be taken advantage of. But if the answer is “no” then you need to be wary today of people who are more than willing to dump their responsibilities on you. You may need to draw a line in the sand, but so be it. Once the Sun changes signs next week you’ll have no problem telling people where to stick it.

"
19 november 2016,libra,"You may feel that your BS meter has been operating non-stop, especially when it comes to dealing with people at the office. Uncertain customers, wishy washy bosses, snarky colleagues and loads of red tape may have made the past five months difficult to wade through. Happily, that ends today as Neptune goes direct. When the Sun changes signs next week you’ll be in a much better position to ask for what you want and actually get it.

"
20 november 2016,libra,"You’ve been working hard, Libra, considering that the Sun has spent the past four weeks in your earnings sector. But it’s scheduled to leave tomorrow, heading for a much more social place. Why not kick back today with a lover or some pals and go off the grid for a few hours? Spontaneous Uranus encourages you to spend some quality time with the people you like the best.

"
21 november 2016,libra,"You have some big decisions to make and now is an excellent time to reach out to others for advice. With the Sun now in your communication sector, you can connect with mentors, coaches, friends, or loved ones for their input. But don’t forget that one of the wisest voices is your own. With optimistic Jupiter in Libra, and serious Saturn in your smart thinking zone, you can figure a lot out on your own.

"
22 november 2016,libra,"Exciting new projects of all kinds can start to present themselves to you, so get ready to dig in and tackle them. You’ll have the energy and the smarts to do so, and some of them could bring long term benefits. With optimistic Jupiter in Libra for the first time in over a decade, you’ll also have the inspiration to go for it. Today is stellar for making progress. The key is to just focus on what you want to do, and not pay attention to the opinions of others.

"
24 november 2016,libra,"Family is the tie that binds, and you may feel that strongly today. Jupiter is in your house of goals and self-esteem, encouraging you to do your own thing, to follow a path designed by you—not your parents, not even your spouse or kids. This doesn’t mean that you’re going to run away from home, but that you may need some space in which to pursue your own passion projects. Problem is, those closest to you may not want you to spread your wings and fly. You’ll be able to discuss this with them at next week’s new moon.

"
25 november 2016,libra,"With next week’s new moon in the most congenial part of your chart you’re about to enter a highly social phase. The problem is that everyone is going to want a piece of you. So how to keep them all happy? You may need to let certain people know that you’re not available 24/7. This may not be easy, considering that Jupiter is making you so optimistic that you think you can juggle it all, but the reality is that you can’t!

"
26 november 2016,libra,"Say what you mean and mean what you say. A serious meeting between talkative Mercury and sober Saturn indicates that your words, be they verbal or written, are powerful right now. Not only that, the things you set in motion can carry forward for years. As a result, this is an excellent time to interview for a job, discuss marriage plans, negotiate a business deal, or start writing a novel. Likewise, if you’ve been holding back your opinions or ideas, now’s the time to let others know how you feel.

"
27 november 2016,libra,"With Tuesday’s new moon coming in your house of candid conversations, it’s time to speak your mind. This is especially true when it comes to matters involving a lover, your kids and money–or a combination of them. Don’t let the demands of other people break your bank or your heart. With serious Saturn in a good angle, you mean business.

"
28 november 2016,libra,"Excellent week to work on written projects, or anything that is a form of self-expression: your art portfolio, film reel, blog, manuscript, thesis, marketing plan or Powerpoint demonstration. With abundant Jupiter in your house of self-image, the work you produce will only enhance your message–and your prestige.

"
29 november 2016,libra,"It’s time to clear the air with the people in your world, and a terrific new moon today in your communications sector allows you to speak candidly. Other planets like Jupiter and Mars are in a great spot, encouraging you to work things out with kids, lovers, and parents in particular. Saturn supports the moon, a good omen as it will allow you to speak your piece with a certain seriousness that others will respect. Oh, and you single people? Go shout it from the mountain that you’re looking for love. With Mars in your house of romance, the stage is set for meeting someone new.

"
30 november 2016,libra,"By all means, aim to be direct today in all of your conversations or anything you put in writing. There’s no room for suffering in silence or playing the passive-aggressive game. Nor should you be beating others over the head like a dictator! That’s because murky Neptune may urge you to cloak your words, act wishy washy or suck it up. Sorry—the Sun will have none of that, thank you. Tell it like it is.

"
1 december 2016,libra,"Take a bow, Libra! The planets are putting you in center stage today. This is a perfect time to dazzle others with your brilliance, whether it’s potential lovers, a prospective boss, your clients or the world via social media and internet presence. With dynamic Mars in the part of your chart that governs creativity and your talents, it’s time to pay attention to your brainstorms and act upon them.

"
2 december 2016,libra,"“Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home” and that saying applies to you, Libra. Your family and home environment will become quite important in the weeks ahead as Mercury has just entered this part of your chart. Make every effort to turn your place into a peaceful sanctuary, whether that means cleaning and decorating, or defusing family arguments and tensions. Mercury will retrograde here on the 19th, and you definitely do not want to bring drama and old problems with you into Christmas or the new year.

"
3 december 2016,libra,"Think it, say it, do it! The planets are lining up to give you the smarts and the motivation to come up with creative plans and then run with them. Communication is the key, as you’ll need to get advice, approval and inspiration from people you trust. This is also an excellent time for self-promotion, and that includes letting admirers know that you’re on the market.

"
4 december 2016,libra,"Hey there Libra, do you feel like sharing some of that charisma you’re oozing these days? With zesty Mars in your house of talent and razzle-dazzle, you’re the person to watch. And today it gets even better with a Moon-Mars-Jupiter connection. This is the perfect time to impress, flirt, connect with or persuade others.

"
5 december 2016,libra,"Albert Einstein famously said, “Once you stop learning, you start dying.” Don’t worry, Libra–you’re not checking out anytime soon. But the planets are  telling you to up your knowledge quotient. Look into night classes, weekend seminars, or podcasts to polish up your skills or just for the sheer joy of absorbing more information. With Venus just about ready to enter your house of creativity, the things you learn could take your life to a much more enjoyable level.

"
6 december 2016,libra,"You need to get things done, and with dynamic Mars in your house of creativity and expression you should have no trouble in showcasing your skills. So much so that you may attract the attention of others, who may want to partner with you in some kind of a joint venture. Should you accept their offer? The planets suggest that you do, as a magnificent aspect on the 12th indicates that a shared vision can go very far.

"
7 december 2016,libra,"Romantic Venus glides into your fifth house of love today, which is a match made in heaven. Over the next few weeks you could meet someone new or fall even more deeply in love with an existing amour. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the fifth house also governs fun and relaxation, so despite the holiday stress you should be carving out some down time. Cultural pursuits are especially favored, such as viewing a museum exhibition, attending a concert, trying a new cuisine or taking up oil painting. Life is too short to always be worrying and working.

"
9 december 2016,libra,"I want, I want! If that’s been your battle cry over the past few months, blame it on abundant Jupiter in Libra. This isn’t about greed; rather, it’s all about living a life that you  create. And with a super aspect today between the Sun and Jupiter, you should be vocal about what it is that you desire. Reach out to the people who can help make it happen. With the Sun in one of the most social parts of your chart you should be networking like mad.

"
10 december 2016,libra,"If you have something important to say, then by all means say it. A serious meeting between the Sun and Saturn indicates that it’s time to express yourself. “Expression” could mean letting others know that you aren’t going to take their nonsense anymore. It could also mean running for political office because you have something to say about the way your town is being run. It could mean penning a novel or setting aside an hour a day to work on your illustration skills. With Saturn involved, whatever you work on can really go the distance.

"
11 december 2016,libra,"Why waste time explaining yourself? Trying to prove to your friends and family that you feel or think a certain way is fruitless, Libra. Sometimes you just gotta show them what you’re all about through your actions. Next week’s full moon is pushing you to color outside the lines, and the people closest to you may be resisting the bold new you.

"
12 december 2016,libra,"Tomorrow’s full moon could put you and your talents on a much bigger (and brighter) stage. Are you ready for the spotlight? Teaming up with collaborators could be the best way to go right now. Don’t be surprised if someone asks to form an alliance. Just make sure that this is the right person before you jump in. With aggressive Mars going into your house of work assignments next week, you don’t want to be doing all of the heavy lifting.

"
13 december 2016,libra,"Live free or die! That’s the state motto of New Hampshire, but it could be your battle cry over the next few days. Blame the spunky attitude on today’s full moon in Gemini which is casting your gaze on wide open places and blue skies. One thing’s for sure—you’re not going to want to be tied down, and that could include your closest relationships with people. If you have felt stifled in a romantic or business alliance, resistance may be building as you consider other options. With lusty Mars in your romance zone, you may want a love affair with lots of fun and little responsibility!

"
14 december 2016,libra,"What’s on your mind shouldn’t necessarily be on your lips, Libra! Sometimes discretion really is the greater part of valor. Serious, sober Saturn in your house of the mind is helping you to think in a rational manner and plan things wisely. But that doesn’t mean that everyone else around you gets that. Keep your opinions to yourself until Saturday, a much better time to hold meaningful conversations with others.

"
15 december 2016,libra,"Someone in your immediate environment may act out of sorts today, and it may catch you off guard. Try not to get emotional about it as you may immediately feel the need to use strong words in response. The ancient Taoist masters always used to say, “To control others requires force. Mastering yourself requires strength.” Keep that in mind as you focus more on keeping your own mindset calm and stable, rather than the words or actions of another.

"
17 december 2016,libra,"Partnering with other people is a good idea right now. Why try tackling a project by yourself when it can be done more efficiently (and perhaps more creatively) with the help of others? It could be planning a party or a trip. Maybe you should join forces with people at the office who share the same mindset and work ethic. When energetic Mars enters Pisces on Monday, your work load is going to increase. Start sharing—and delegating.

"
18 december 2016,libra,"Stop comparing yourself to other people, Libra! You’re fine the way you are. Life is not a contest to see who dies with the most toys or the best Instagram account. If you find yourself wishing for things today that are currently beyond your reach, remember that the most abundant planet in the solar system–Jupiter–will be blessing you into October of 2017.

"
19 december 2016,libra,"Who needs to wait til New Year’s Eve to start a diet and fitness program? If you want to get going now, the planets are in your favor. The same holds true for ridding yourself of nagging health problems. That’s because determined Mars moves into your sixth house of wellness today, its first visit here in a few years. With Mercury retrograding in your house of comfort, make sure that you don’t push yourself too hard, too fast.

"
20 december 2016,libra,"With Mercury retrograde don’t be surprised if certain people or situations make you feel uncomfortable. You’re in quite the “can do” mode right now, so if you sense that someone is slacking or is throwing up roadblocks in a passive-aggressive way, you’re probably right. Don’t sweat it. Charge forward without them if need be. Pretty soon you’ll feel on top of things to the point where you won’t even notice them.

"
21 december 2016,libra,"Right now the cosmos is creating a tug of war between your home life and work responsibilities. Which one will win? From the looks of it, your family and home will rule between now and New Year’s. The mighty Sun enters your domestic zone today, asking you to create more quality time for loved ones—and a bit more organization at home too! If you’re the one who’s doing all the grunt work by yourself, it’s time to delegate tasks. The 27th and 28th are perfect for laying down the law.

"
22 december 2016,libra,"You could become quite moody or confused about the direction a romantic relationship is taking, a feeling that may increase in the week ahead. A partner could be acting erratically, sending mixed signals. Whether you can handle their drama or you’re pretty much done with it will be determined around the time of the new moon on the 29th.

"
23 december 2016,libra,"You may realize that one of the best ways to lower your stress level is to become more organized, and with the emotional Moon in a good angle to Mars this may become a 2017 resolution. Examine your habits and routines today for weaknesses. By Monday the 26th you’ll be ready to start pulling things together. The entire week between Christmas and New Year’s is full of positive aspects for streamlining your life.

"
24 december 2016,libra,"It’s a smart move to network over the next few days as you never know who might be able to help you–in work, love or in introducing you to new friends and neighbors. With lucky Jupiter in your sign you’re sure to make a good impression, so don’t be shy. Someone may suggest a business alliance in the near future, and this could pick up speed after the 29th.

"
25 december 2016,libra,"An exchange of ideas is in the air, so get out there and mingle with as many people as possible. This could be a creative venture, a new friendship or a love relationship. With magnetic Venus in fine form today you’re looking like the cat’s pajamas. With lucky Jupiter in your sign you’re becoming more self-assured–and it shows.

"
26 december 2016,libra,"As optimistic as you may be about the future, you may be concerned about the direction a romance has been taking. You’re needing more freedom these days as you’re getting in touch with your true nature, thanks to abundant Jupiter in your sign. While this doesn’t mean that you’re going to split up, it can mean that you need to work out how you can pursue your own interests and ambitions within the confines of a relationship.

"
27 december 2016,libra,"Sometimes simplicity is best, and the cosmos asks you to consider “feng shui-ing” your life. With motivator Mars and inspirational Neptune both in your house of simplifying and organizing, it’s time to declutter your house, office and mind. When the clutter goes away, so will a lot of stress.

"
28 december 2016,libra,"If you’ve been wondering about the best way to handle a drama or issue with someone close, the next few days will provide you with some clarity. The good thing is that a practical solution will emerge, one that you’ll know in your heart is the right one. Whether the people around you agree or not is another issue, but they’ve been getting away with difficult behavior for far too long.

"
29 december 2016,libra,"Relationships may have been up and down over the past few months, and you may have been unsure as to which steps to take. Well, the confusion and waiting are over as rebellious Uranus resumes direct motion. You’ll definitely be craving more security and comfort thanks to the new moon in Capricorn, so start taking the necessary steps to remedy any problems. The best part is that you’ll be in a practical, no-nonsense mood–no rose colored glasses this time.

"
30 december 2016,libra,"Opening up your heart and being more vulnerable could be the ticket to greater peace of mind today with a happy meeting between the Sun and Neptune. You’ve been doing a lot for other people lately–now it’s time to let others know that you need some tender loving care also.

"
31 december 2016,libra,"Got some bright ideas? It wouldn’t be surprising, not with intelligent Saturn firing up your house of thinking and self-expression. The good thing is that Saturn is all about practicality, so you can keep things real. Optimistic Jupiter is also in your corner telling you to take a chance. What a great way to roll into 2017!

"
1 january 2017,scorpio,"Still hanging on to that piece of mistletoe? If not, go out and grab some because a highly romantic aspect takes place today in your house of love. Singles, Mars will light a fire in your heart to find someone in 2017. The red planet meets up with Neptune today, so all Scorpios will  be affected positively. A pregnancy could occur over the next four weeks too as Venus glides into this part of your chart on Tuesday.

"
2 january 2017,scorpio,"You’re only as good as your skill set, Scorpio, and the cosmos is pushing you to polish up yours. Whether it’s being a more convincing sales rep, a more creative graphic artist or a more eloquent speaker, developing more talent is the way to go right now. With so much planetary activity in Pisces over the next few weeks, this is your best time in 2017 to learn more so that you can earn more.

"
3 january 2017,scorpio,"Yum! Romantic Venus joins lusty Mars and amorous Neptune in your house of love today, setting off plenty of sparks. Attached Scorpios should be planning some luxe (even decadent) date nights with their beau or belle. Singles, the next four weeks rock for meeting a lover who’s perhaps more interesting than some of the characters you’ve been involved with in the past! Just don’t get swept off your feet too quickly, a possibility under these aspects.

"
4 january 2017,scorpio,"You’re ready for some big  changes in 2017 and the upcoming full moon on the 12th is the perfect time to launch new initiatives, whether they’re personal or business related. But you might want to spend the next week focusing on making more money as Mercury retrogrades into your income sector today. If you started a job search before the holidays, reconnect with people and companies you contacted before then. Throw yourself into developing new products, services and prospecting plans. It’s also a smart move to review your budget at home and at the office—and plug the leaks!

"
5 january 2017,scorpio,"If you’ve been a little slow getting out of the starting gate so far in 2017, don’t sweat it. Mercury is retrograde in the sector that deals with habits and routines, so now is a good time to come up with some smarter ones that will serve you well. Besides, the passionate Moon meets up with energetic Uranus today, lighting a fire under your tush to get moving. As physicist Isaac Newton so correctly stated, “An object at rest will remain at rest until a force sets it in motion.” May the force be with you, Scorpio. You’ll develop even more momentum after Mercury goes direct on Sunday.

"
7 january 2017,scorpio,"Your passion toward your work can speak volumes today, Scorpio! Reach out to clients, colleagues and employees as you’ll be persuasive and confident. And as we all know, confidence is charismatic. Not feeling the love toward your job? Then it’s high time that you did. When Mercury goes direct on Sunday you’ll be able to pursue a career option that will be more in tune with who you really are.

"
8 january 2017,scorpio,"Financial affairs can spring forward now that Mercury has gone direct in your house of income, savings and budgeting. This is a great time to reconnect with prospective clients you were trying to close or a potential new boss who might have been talking to you about a job. It’s a smart move also to examine your budget, both at home or in business, and plug and leaks. Things could really gain momentum at the time of Thursday’s full moon, so have all your ducks in a row.

"
9 january 2017,scorpio,"Your heart and your head may be at odds today, making it difficult to see a situation for what it really is all about. The upcoming full moon on Thursday will help you step away from matters, almost as if you’re being lifted to a mountaintop so that you can see the bigger picture below you. Avoid the tendency to cling to old, outdated notions.

"
10 january 2017,scorpio,"There’s usually no shortage of drama in an office setting as someone always has to be the Queen Bee or Mr. Know It All. Well, today and tomorrow they’ll be in full diva mode, to which you might say, “So what else is new?”  What’s new is a tense Sun-Uranus aspect that spells trouble if you decide to engage in conversation with these people, or via text and e-mail. Even people you think you can trust may have an agenda, so be on your guard.

"
11 january 2017,scorpio,"You’re in an unusual situation, Scorpio, in that both your logical mind and intuition are both operating at warp speed. As a result you can make smart decisions and communicate beautifully. But that’s you,  though. The problem today is that others may not be as straightforward, rational or motivated as you are. The full moon in Cancer tomorrow will bring out the visionary in you, but you may have to work on those visions by yourself for awhile.

"
12 january 2017,scorpio,"Initiatives that you began months ago could start to wrap up quite nicely, Scorpio. You’re in a highly productive place these days, with intelligent Mercury now in your house of thinking, writing and communicating. There’s also a full moon today in the sector that governs publicity, publishing, and going international. Even if you don’t end up on a public stage your ideas are lofty and can really go places. Been considering going back to school or attending a seminar? Now’s the time to book it. However, the full moon is involved in a grand cross, which indicates that there could be some passive-aggressive types or malcontents in your midst. Don’t let them get in the way of your vision and plans.

"
13 january 2017,scorpio,"Pull out all the stops this weekend and make some plans to have a good time! The Moon is in frisky, flirty Leo for starters. Then, Venus and Neptune, the two most romantic planets in the heavens, just met up in your house of amour. It’s a time for glamour, looking fine and enjoying the attention of admirers–not to mention falling in love with someone new or spicing up an existing romance.

"
14 january 2017,scorpio,"Keeping your feet on the ground could be a challenge under current cosmic conditions! But what’s so bad about being in love or feeling passionate about life? Enthusiasm is contagious, and with chatty Mercury now in your communication sector you can shout your bright ideas and emotions from the mountaintops. Private convos with a lover or your kids can also go well, and domestic matters shine after the Sun enters Aquarius next Thursday.

"
15 january 2017,scorpio,"Sometimes the best advice you can receive comes from within, not from outside.  The planets recommend that you disregard the opinions of friends, colleagues and even a lover as there may simply be too many voices clamoring to be heard over the next few days. Fortunately for you, abundant Jupiter is in your house of intuition, and yours will be in fine form, especially on Wednesday of this week.

"
16 january 2017,scorpio,"This is an excellent day for brainstorming, especially with others. Whether it’s a volunteer group, your friends or a departmental team at the office, toss around ideas that will help you make some positive plans for the future. A difficult Moon-Mars aspect indicates that not everyone will agree on the direction, and there could also be “creative differences”. But these pass quickly, with Wednesday being a super time to work them out.

"
17 january 2017,scorpio,"Time to set new boundaries with a lover or your kids? If things have gotten out of control it’s up to you to regain it. With aggressive Mars in this sector, though, you run the risk of coming on too strong. Likewise, be careful of trying to push through an agenda of yours with someone close. Patience, Scorpio–next week is perfect for communicating.

"
18 january 2017,scorpio,"Hey there, Van Gogh! Scorpios are looking like the creative geniuses and artistes of the zodiac these days, brimming with bright ideas. Jupiter is stirring up your creative mojo in the house of the subconscious mind as Mars helps you express your talents and skills. A helpful aspect between the two of them today suggests that you refine your methods a bit. All forward thinking people recognize the need to sharpen their mental tools.

"
19 january 2017,scorpio,"Excitement, romance and luxury are all desirable, but at what cost? Today a tense standoff between Mars in your house of fun, amour and creativity and stern Saturn in your income sector suggests that you find a balance between spending and carousing. Not only that, more security seems to be necessary in romantic partnerships as well. If you’re unsure as to where a relationship is going, ask questions and demand answers.

"
20 january 2017,scorpio,"Home is where the heart is, and now that the Sun is in the most domestic and comfort-driven part of your chart, you’ll want not only a peaceful home environment but a happy romance to accompany it. Fortunately for you the two cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, are together in your house of amour. Better yet is that verbal Mercury is in a good spot to help you communicate. Singles, your best bet for meeting someone new is by socializing and putting in face time, not on line.

"
21 january 2017,scorpio,"The Moon is in your sign this weekend, Scorpio, a positive placement as it puts you first! La Luna sends a beam to Chiron in your creativity sector, suggesting that it’s time for a makeover. Chiron is knows as the wounded healer, and the first step you should take to to cleanse yourself of old hurts that may have negatively impacted your self esteem.

"
22 january 2017,scorpio,"Friday’s upcoming new moon in one of the most sensitive and comfort-driven parts of your chart is already having an effect on you, Scorpio. Today a happy moon-Sun aspect recommends that you examine your emotions to understand better what makes you feel unsettled or insecure. With generous Jupiter in the part of your chart that governs the subconscious mind and our deepest thoughts and feelings, you can make headway.

"
23 january 2017,scorpio,"Progress can be made in a career matter, especially when it comes to scoring a higher income. A positive Moon-Saturn aspect in your earnings sector bodes well for job hunts or landing a promotion. This Friday’s new moon takes place in your house of security and comfort, so increasing your income will definitely be on the forefront of you mind. Just make sure that you’re not lured in by flattery and empty promises, a possibility with deceptive Neptune in a funky mood.

"
24 january 2017,scorpio,"You’re a man or woman with a plan, thanks to intelligent Mercury stoking your desire to ponder, plan and verbalize what you’d like to manifest. Today the messenger planet forms a sparkling aspect with inspirational Neptune, helping you come up with even more good ideas. It’s an excellent week to discuss your ideas with others, sign up for a class, sharpen your skills or find a mentor who can help you take things to a higher level.

"
25 january 2017,scorpio,"It’s time to switch up your methods of communicating, Scorpio. As the emotional Moon signals transformative Pluto in your self-expression sector, you’re being advised to find new ways to get your point across to people you love or work with. Perhaps you need to be more stern or direct. Maybe you need to be more flexible or forgiving. Your intuition is spot on, so use it to your advantage and to find peace.

"
26 january 2017,scorpio,"Need to reexamine your expectations about love? That seems to be the case with a Venus-Jupiter connection. However, as these are two of the most optimistic and abundant planets in the solar system, they’ve got your back. Maybe you’re setting your sights too low, settling for crumbs at the love banquet. Perhaps you’re too busy comparing yourself to other people. Whatever it is, make sure that you’re not settling, but at the same time that you don’t have pie in the sky fantasies about amour.

"
27 january 2017,scorpio,"A fabulous new chapter is opening up in your home and family life thanks to today’s new moon in Aquarius. One of the items on the planets’ agenda is your neighborhood: are you happy there? Do you want to move? Stay? Perhaps you should get more involved in local activities, such as the political scene or helping establish a farmer’s market on the weekends with organic produce. Your finances are looking good too, especially long term if you’re thinking about buying or decorating. Just go slow with the spending and stretch purchases out over the next six months.

"
28 january 2017,scorpio,"So many things to do, so little time! Current planetary aspects are putting you in a spot where you could be very busy with chores and projects both at home and the office. Today energetic Mars enters your super-organized sixth house, encouraging you to get your act together with better systems and habits.  As a result you may not know where to begin. Clean out the basement? Empty your e-mail accounts? Hire better people? Oh, and by the way—this is also the house of diet and fitness. You’ve got your work cut out for you.

"
29 january 2017,scorpio,"Get the word out! An energetic and productive meeting between chatty Mercury and powerful Pluto sets the stage for shameless self promotion. This is a great time to work on your brand, portfolio, thesis, marketing plan, blog or website. The key is to be as detail-oriented as possible now that Mars is in your house of “the fine print”.

"
30 january 2017,scorpio,"Yum. It’s a sparkling day for romance as the passionate Moon meets up with amorous Neptune. It’s also a terrific time to spend with your kids, so clear your schedule today of all chores and just relax with the people you love. Singles, your best place for meeting someone this week is not online but in person, so get out there and socialize.

"
31 january 2017,scorpio,"Right now your head may be spinning with ideas and details thanks to hosting two of the most energetic planets in the cosmos, Mars and Uranus, in your get-things-done house. While this is a super set-up for blasting through your chores and coming up with creative ideas, it can also cause information overload. Today’s Mercury-Uranus square could fry your circuits. Slow down, count to ten, and just take things one step at a time.

"
1 february 2017,scorpio,"Aarghh! An emotional smackdown between the Moon and Jupiter could make you feel as though there aren’t enough hours in the day to get everything done. From your chart it appears that you need some R & R, but when will you ever find the time? After the 6th, that’s when. Mighty Jupiter will retrograde in your twelfth house of cocooning, nurturing and extreme self-care. Wrap up as many tasks as you can before then, because you’re going to be taking a siesta.

"
2 february 2017,scorpio,"Is it time to pull away from the pack? Whether it’s your friends, your colleagues or society in general, it looks like you need a little down time–alone. Sometimes we get so caught up in what other people are thinking, doing, and scheming that we lose our objectivity. Take a break to recharge your batteries and to get a better perspective on what’s going on in your world.

"
3 february 2017,scorpio,"Been promising yourself forever that you’re going to break a habit or get organized? It should be easy to do over the next month now that planet of ease, Venus, is in your house of efficiency. You can also get into a much more vibrant state of health by sticking to a diet and exercise regimen. Besides, you’re going to need to be both healthy and productive. The lunar eclipse on the 10th falls in your house of ambition, so rest up now.

"
4 february 2017,scorpio,"Just how much should you share? With Jupiter getting ready to go retrograde in your house of confidentiality, you may be in a self-protective mode. But the gas giant will be direct all weekend and the Moon is in a helpful spot, so if you have something to say then say it. Let the chips fall where they may. You have a lot on your plate and don’t have time to endlessly ruminate about how other people are going to take it.

"
5 february 2017,scorpio,"They say that flattery will get you everywhere, but today you have to make sure that you’re not at the receiving end of someone’s insincerity. A close connection could resort to guilt or poor-little-me routines in order to get what they want. When Jupiter retrogrades tomorrow you’ll become even more conscious of the games people play and the manner in which you react. Stay on your toes.

"
6 february 2017,scorpio,"If there’s any sign that is entitled to pick up and move to a beach shack in Tahiti (or a mountaintop in Nepal) so that you can meditate, it’s you, Scorpio. Don’t forget massages, naps, plopping down with a good book, silencing your phone and ignoring everyone’s drama. But this is reality, so your chances of actually doing so are slim. What’s a Scorpio to do? Go within. Jupiter is retrograding in your twelfth house of silence and healing, a perfect aspect for healing your tired mind, body and soul. This aspect will last until early June, so you’ll have plenty of time to unwind.

"
7 february 2017,scorpio,"A strong pull to home and family could arise over the next three weeks as Mercury enters your domestic fourth house. Even if you’re single the desire to have roots and a comfortable place to come home to will be strong. A female figure in your life, such as your mom or grandmother, could influence you–even if they have crossed over! This is the perfect time to think back to times spent with women who meant  a lot to you, and the lessons you learned from them.

"
8 february 2017,scorpio,"Power struggles may erupt and it could be hard to tell who has your back. This is not a good day to voice your opinion too strongly, as someone may resort to snarky tactics in response. Protect your ideas too, as they seem to have merit and could be worth some cash down the road. Tomorrow is a  much better day for cooperation, both at home and the office.

"
9 february 2017,scorpio,"A sudden “Martha Stewart moment” might strike, Scorpio, so don the rubber gloves and start scrubbing. Seriously, erratic Uranus in your ultra-organized sixth house is on a roll, so don’t be surprised if you have an insatiable desire to organize your sock drawer and the spice rack. By the way, this vibe continues into the weekend, so power up with caffeine and roll up your sleeves. As Martha says, “It’s a good thing.”

"
10 february 2017,scorpio,"OK, I have a special news flash for all of you Scorpios out there who are tired of hearing the following: “Jupiter is in Libra, so things will move slowly and you have a lot on inner work to do besides.” While that may be true, many Scorpios are chomping at the bit these days, wondering when the hell things are going to start picking up momentum. Tonight, baby! A luscious Leo lunar eclipse in your house of ambition starts to green light projects that are near and dear to your heart. Whether you’re looking for love, want to lose weight or patent an invention, mighty Leo starts greasing the wheels. Other planetary aspects in place today recommend that you start with your career. There could be a sudden job opening or client who wants to do business with you, so look alive.

"
11 february 2017,scorpio,"A happy meeting today of the Sun and abundant Jupiter is perfect for developing closer bonds with the people who mean the most to you. Our home and roots matter more than we realize sometimes. Reminiscing and feeling nostalgic are part of the energy that the cosmos has on offer, so spend some quiet time honoring your ancestors and the people in your life right now.

"
12 february 2017,scorpio,"Hesitancy may arise when it comes to handling issues with loved ones, especially a lover or kids. Two of the most confusing orbs in the solar system, the Moon and Neptune, are at odds in the sectors that govern your nearest and dearest. Perhaps you’re worried that you and a lover don’t share the same values, or you can’t figure out the best way to discipline a child. The fog starts to lift on Tuesday and is gone by Saturday when the Sun enters Pisces.

"
13 february 2017,scorpio,"Some kind of plan that you have for your family or residence may need tweaking today, Scorpio. Perhaps you realize that you need to save more in order to buy the kind of home you desire, or you have to get your parents set up with better medical care. Home-related issues will be on the front burner from now through the 23rd, and the aspects are all good ones for making progress.

"
14 february 2017,scorpio,"Yeah, baby! Can we shag now, or should we shag later? The Moon and Jupiter in your fantasy-fueled twelfth house could stimulate some interesting boudoir activity. But other planets will keep you down to Earth, demanding that a lover be good relationship material as well. With mature Saturn in your financial zone, you’re not willing to take chances on a broke but charming amour.

"
15 february 2017,scorpio,"Overwhelmed by details or your duties? It could catch up with you today. It appears from your chart that you’ve been way too optimistic about what you can achieve in a 24-hour period. Start scheduling in some down time just to unwind. Your mental health needs as much care as your body does.

"
16 february 2017,scorpio,"You can’t stop a moving train by standing on the tracks, something that people around you should figure out! You’re on a roll, Scorpio, developing momentum as you push through projects like a hot knife cutting through a stick of butter. Keep doing what you’re doing. It will pay off down the road with a greater sense of comfort and security.

"
17 february 2017,scorpio,"Lines could get crossed with a family member, landlord, roommate, lover or contractor who works on your home. You especially need to make sure that everything is understood before you proceed with any kind of big decision or venture. That said, next week’s energy for anything related to your house or family looks terrific, starting on Monday.

"
18 february 2017,scorpio,"Ah, sweet romance! The cosmos is ready to deliver some juicy goodies your way now that the Sun is in your fifth house of fun, frolic and amour. Over the next month you can experience more joy and quality time with your lover and your kids, too, as children are part of the fifth house. The lunar eclipse on the 26th falls in this part of your chart, and with unpredictable Uranus in a tight angle, something sudden could happen around that time. From your chart it appears that it’s a happy occurrence, so stay on your toes.

"
19 february 2017,scorpio,"Now that the Sun is in your house of romance, you should be ready for some flirting and racy date nights. But all Scorpios, single or attached, are going to be demanding security and some guarantees from a lover. With other planets in house that are quite focused on comfort and domesticity, playing around just for kicks isn’t in the stars.

"
20 february 2017,scorpio,"Do something wonderful for others and you help yourself at the same time. Spontaneous Uranus is in your house of giving selflessly, and today it forms a happy aspect with Mercury. If you have an idea or a desire to help people or animals in need, or the environment, act on it.

"
21 february 2017,scorpio,"Aahh, sweet relief. A wonderfully healing aspect helps you sift through old mental baggage and let it go. It’s especially good for releasing old family dramas that may still be affecting you. It’s time to 86 this trash, as the upcoming eclipse on Sunday falls in your house of fun and romance.

"
22 february 2017,scorpio,"Got one nerve left–and everyone’s working it? That’s the way you may feel today as work projects or household chores and personal errands begin to overwhelm you. With dynamic Mars in your get-things-done house, you’re being pushed to knock items off your to-do list. Problem is, you may be so overworked that you’re about to snap. Slow down.

"
23 february 2017,scorpio,"Being happy with your home and personal life carries forward into other areas of your existence, so it’s smart to ensure that you have security and comfort there. A helpful Saturn-Mercury aspect will enable you to talk matters over with loved ones. Saturn’s goal is to bring you long-term stability, so if something is shaky, it may need to go.

"
24 february 2017,scorpio,"A nice balance between your head and your heart exists today, so use it to create more harmony in your life. A wildly creative time is just about ready to begin due to Sunday’s solar eclipse in your house of living authentically. Consider what you can do to enjoy a more innovative lifestyle.

"
25 february 2017,scorpio,"Big doin’s are coming your way in romance! Today verbal Mercury enters your flirty fifth house, then tomorrow a solar eclipse takes place there too. It’s time to put your feelings out there if you’re involved with someone. If you’re single the next six months could bring in a hot new honey. Get out there and start socializing.

"
26 february 2017,scorpio,"Turning point! Your love life reaches a major moment due to a solar eclipse in Pisces, the last one in a series that has been going on since 2015. A new chapter is about to begin. Fed up with your lover? It may be time to go. But if you’re happy then an even more amorous stage will evolve. Singles could meet someone between now and September, but avoid moving too quickly.

"
27 february 2017,scorpio,"Keep your radar turned on, Scorpio. Someone may not have your best interests at heart; indeed, they may be working their own agenda and trying to figure out how you can play a part in their game. From your chart this appears to most likely be someone at the office, and they could be quite pushy about it. But don’t allow yourself to be manipulated by anyone, at the workplace or your personal life. Take your time in making key decisions.

"
28 february 2017,scorpio,"Your motivation to get things done, both at home and at work, is rising as a super spontaneous Mars-Uranus aspect is lighting a fire underneath you. That doesn’t mean, however, that everyone shares your level of enthusiasm, nor do they have your work ethic. You may be tempted to blast them into the stratosphere but it will backfire. They’ll just dig in their heels and resolve to do even less. Let it pass.

"
1 march 2017,scorpio,"Go glam, Scorpio! A sweet meet-up of get-gorgeous Neptune and the sizzling Sun tells you to make over your looks. These two heavenly bodies conjunct in your fifth house, which not only governs romance but also creativity. It’s time to break away from an outmoded self-image and try on a new persona. While you’re at it, expect a lot of attention from admirers.

"
2 march 2017,scorpio,"Attention to detail can be a beautiful thing. After all, that’s how works of art were created by the Masters. And you certainly wouldn’t want to be operated on by a surgeon who doesn’t pay attention to the smaller things—like your nerves and blood vessels! But problems can arise when you’re so hell bent on the minutiae that you become a control freak. The planets warn that you’re pushing yourself too hard, perhaps to the point of placing your physical and mental health at risk. Loosen up your grip on the reins.

"
3 march 2017,scorpio,"You may need to take on a more active role in a business or romantic partnership, or perhaps simply become more vocal. With Venus about to retrograde for four weeks there could be disagreements about who’s carrying more of the load in the alliance. Try to work this out before Saturday when Venus starts to backslide.

"
4 march 2017,scorpio,"“If you want to get something done the right way, you have to do it yourself.”  That saying may be running through your mind over the next four weeks as Venus retrogrades in your work sector. People around you may not be pulling their weight, slowing down your progress as a result. But it’s also possible that you’re the one who’s starting to slack, so unless you want to anger the boss or clients, stay on top of your work. The good news is that your creativity will rise, so this is a good time to perhaps deliberately slow down with projects and figure out a more skilled way to complete them.

"
5 march 2017,scorpio,"This is one of your best days all year to create new habits, routines and protocols, both at work and at home. With disciplined Saturn in a good angle to motivator Mars, you’ll have both the drive and the stick-to-it-iveness to truly get things done. Over the next four weeks continue to come up with hacks that will streamline your life.

"
6 march 2017,scorpio,"With assertive Mars getting ready to move into your commitment sector on Thursday, now’s a good time to have a talk with your lover about the future. The authoritative Sun and eloquent Mercury will help put the right words in your mouth. No need to yell or issue ultimatums…just say your piece. And singles, start spouse shopping if that’s your aim. The next few days are fortuitous for meeting someone new.

"
7 march 2017,scorpio,"“But we’ve always done it this way!” Those kinds of thoughts may be running through your mind, or you’re surrounded by folks who are stuck in an old worn out routine. Busting out of past patterns may not be easy today, but give the matter some thought. The rest of the week is super for thinking—and acting—more creatively.

"
8 march 2017,scorpio,"Why are you hiding your talent, Scorpio? You’ve got it—so flaunt it! Today’s energy is perfect for demonstrating that you have the chops to get something done with flair and originality. But why not take your skills to a higher level while you’re at it? Sign up for a class or lessons. Improve your golf game, watercoloring skills, public speaking ability, decorating flair, parenting skills, Spanish, or managerial talent.

"
9 march 2017,scorpio,"Teamwork takes center stage in the month ahead. Today Mars enters your house of partnerships which includes business and romantic alliances. And then with next week’s full moon falling in your house of groups and networking, it’s who you know—rather than what you know—that will inform your life in the future. Don’t try to go it alone, Scorpio. Two heads are better than one—and three are even better than that!

"
10 march 2017,scorpio,"Opportunities can open up for you in the near future, both in love and business. Today the Moon urges you to examine just how much you’re enjoying life versus how hard you’re working. The key is to find more balance. With Sunday’s full moon approaching in your house of camaraderie, you’ll be doing more socializing in all areas of your life, so get ready to network.

"
11 march 2017,scorpio,"You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar, the saying goes, and you would be wise to pay heed. Your intuition is operating at full throttle, but just because it gives you a heads up about someone’s agenda doesn’t mean that you should call them out on it. Keep your opinions to yourself and put a smile on your face.

"
12 march 2017,scorpio,"Team and group efforts can take off like a shot thanks to the full moon in Virgo, but some of the roles and responsibilities of individuals may need to be switched up in order to achieve the best results. And if you’re considering launching or revising a website, Etsy store, online venture or social media campaign, this lunation can provide you with the leverage and publicity that you need.

"
13 march 2017,scorpio,"Managing your time, work flow and even the actions of other people will become important over the next few weeks. Now that Mercury is in your ultra efficient sixth house, you not only have to make sure that you’re on top of your own game at home and the office, but that other people are too. Just don’t get too pushy as others will deliberately put up resistance.

"
14 march 2017,scorpio,"You’re in an excellent spot for enjoying emotional healing today, thanks to a meeting of the passionate Moon and optimistic Jupiter. However, if you want to make headway you’ll need to change your mental habits and the way you think. Self-help seminars, affirmations and therapy sessions all have their place, but they need to be followed up with by solid, healthy routines.

"
15 march 2017,scorpio,"With Venus retrograde in the sector that deals with close relationships–such as a lover or business alliance–you may be questioning your next move. It’s a smart time to do so, because once the Sun moves into this part of the sky on the 20th you’ll have some decisions to make. Just how passionate do you feel about love, life and your occupation?

"
16 march 2017,scorpio,"Gotta love it when the cosmos inspires us to get organized! Inertia can be a powerful force (just ask Isaac Newton) and it often seems that we need to be catapulted into taking action. But a more languid Moon-Neptune aspect today can get you on the path to efficiency and streamlining without a lot of angst.

"
17 march 2017,scorpio,"You could be feeling mighty passionate these days—about a person, project or a cause—but you need to keep your emotions in check. Stern Saturn warns that passion needs to be tempered with discipline and logical thinking. And while you’re at it, develop better habits and routines that will channel that passion in a constructive way.

"
18 march 2017,scorpio,"Look out, world! The planets are aligning in just the right way for Scorpios to turn into whirling dervishes of efficiency. This ultra-productive stage kicks off today with a meeting of profitable Venus and intelligent Mercury in your house of getting things done. You won’t be in the mood for tolerating slackers and delays, that’s for sure. Start strategizing this weekend about what you’d like to accomplish over the next month.

"
19 march 2017,scorpio,"You can’t do it all, Scorpio. If you need help at home or the office you need to delegate and/or hire folks who can pick up the slack. Once the Sun enters Aries tomorrow you are in for one exhausting but productive time period. Chores and assignments will pile up. However, you’ll be motivated to blast through them. Just make sure that you’re not the only one carrying the load.
 

"
20 march 2017,scorpio,"Move over, Martha Stewart. There’s a new organization whiz in town and they’re a Scorpio. Now that the Sun is in your ultra-efficient sixth house of getting things done, you’ll be highly motivated to knock things off your to-do list both at home and at the office. And what happened to that New Year’s diet and exercise regimen? Did that fall by the wayside? The sixth house governs your physique and health, so get back on track.

"
21 march 2017,scorpio,"Between now and the end of the week, try not to take what you hear and see at face value. There are people in your midst who are saying one thing but thinking and planning differently. While tomorrow is a better day to communicate and get to the root of matters, you need to stay on your guard through the end of the month.

"
22 march 2017,scorpio,"Change your approach with people if you want to make headway. Maybe you need to come on stronger. Perhaps you should pull back. Over the next few days people could be difficult to read or be just downright difficult. It may seem like everything is a big chess game but by next week some of the flak will start to dissipate.

"
23 march 2017,scorpio,"Squabbles, arguments, pissing matches—that’s what’s on tap today. Sounds like fun, huh? Well, a stinky Pluto-Mercury square is setting the stage for people in your world to not only be vocal, but impractical while they’re mouthing off. And it continues into tomorrow. My advice? Take a vow of silence for the next 48 hours and don’t get involved.

"
24 march 2017,scorpio,"No matter how much you want to believe in others—that they’re straightforward, honest or share your beliefs—you need to be a bit wary. A tense Jupiter-Mercury face-off in the heavens indicates that someone in your midst may have an agenda, one that does not favor or support you. Let both your intuition and logical mind guide you over the next few days.

"
25 march 2017,scorpio,"Everyone wants a sexy, healthy body, but not everyone is prepared to pay the price—and I’m not talking about paying for liposuction. Fortunately for you, diet and exercise regimens should be a lot easier to start and maintain thanks to take-it-easy Venus in that sector today. There will be a new moon here on Tuesday too, and with disciplinarian Saturn in your house of routines and habits, you can really stick to your plans this time.

"
26 march 2017,scorpio,"Many creative people claim that they can’t get their artistic juices flowing if their place is a mess. Regardless as to your occupation, getting organized both at the office and home could lead to a burst of inspiration. Spontaneous Uranus is in fine form today from your highly efficient sixth house, telling you to get off your butt. A messy desk is not always the sign of a creative mind!

"
27 march 2017,scorpio,"With libidinous Mars blazing a path through your commitment sector, you want a lover who’s not a dud in the sack. Well Scorpio, you’re in luck! Mars forms a glorious aspect with amorous Neptune, helping to put some sizzle back into your sex life. This coming Thursday is also a yummy day for romance, so book some alone time with your lover.

"
28 march 2017,scorpio,"Little things add up, Scorpio, something that today’s new moon will remind you about. It occurs in your organized, efficient sixth house, which not only deals with our habits and routines, but our physical health. This makes sense, as glowing health is the result of solid habits followed day after day. This is your best time in 2017 to get your act together—at the office, at home and your level of fitness and vitality.

"
29 march 2017,scorpio,"Negotiations with clients, service providers and supervisors are well aspected today, thanks to a prosperous Mercury-Saturn connection. This energy is also auspicious for applying for a new job or going on an interview. There is some serious long term potential involved with whatever transpires today, so put your best face and effort out there.

"
30 march 2017,scorpio,"Keep your opinions to yourself today, as a tough Jupiter-Pluto aspect indicates that you might spill to the wrong person. Someone in your midst could be a frenemy or passive-aggressive, working their own agenda while they smile to your face. Don’t be surprised if someone tries to push your buttons or twist your arm into doing things you don’t want to do. Quietly stand your ground.

"
31 march 2017,scorpio,"The recent new moon on Tuesday fell in the house that helps you make progress at the office. Helping matters along is the entry of hard-working, intelligent Mercury into your partnership zone today. Why do all of the grunt work by yourself? It’s time to hook up with another person who shares your work ethic and ideas. It could be a formal business partnership or simply finding a co-worker whom you can trust to share the load. Get moving before April 9th, because Mercury goes retrograde then.

"
1 april 2017,scorpio,"Business collaborations could be the ticket to expanding your influence and earning more, but don’t expect overnight success. Mercury will be retrograding in a week’s time in your house of partnerships, along with Saturn moving backward in your income sector next Thursday. If you have the patience and foresight to put in the effort and wait patiently, success is a foregone conclusion.

"
2 april 2017,scorpio,"Drama alert! Love planet Venus retrogrades into your house of amour through the 15th. But from your chart it appears that you want nothing but the truth and straight talk. As a result, make sure that the drama isn’t coming from you, as your  behavior is all you can really control. This Thursday is a much better time to get to the bottom of things and hold constructive talks.

"
3 april 2017,scorpio,"Now that Venus is retrograding in your romance sector, love will be on your mind. And today the emotional Moon is linking up with amorous Neptune, increasing your desire to experience only the deepest kind of love. But while you’re blissfully daydreaming, don’t forget the “finer points”, also known as the nitty gritty: who’s going to do the laundry, clean the house, raise the kids, deal with the parents and so on. It ain’t sexy but neither is a relationship in which people are fighting over this kind of stuff.

"
4 april 2017,scorpio,"A work project or personal to-do may go off the rails, courtesy of a tense Moon-Uranus aspect. Maybe it’s your medical insurance company denying a claim that they should be covering. Perhaps a co-worker drops the ball. A client may pitch a fit over something that’s not worth it. Just keep calm and carry on. The good news is that with the Moon in your far-sighted house of visionary thinking, you’ll be able to work around these people.

"
5 april 2017,scorpio,"Show off your stuff today! Impress bosses and clients with your can-do attitude and talent. With magnetic Venus in your house of skill development this is also a good time to sign up for a class or seminar. The good news is that this can pay off financially too.

"
6 april 2017,scorpio,"Tighten up the purse strings, Scorpio! Saturn has just gone retrograde in your house of earning and saving money, which is an aspect that will last for several months. Cash flow could get a little tricky, bosses might be slow to sign off on a raise, and potential employers might take their sweet time. Clients could also drag their feet when it comes to signing deals or making decisions. Patience will be your greatest virtue, along with setting aside savings for a rainy day.

"
7 april 2017,scorpio,"It appears from your chart that your tired mind and body need a rest, but that household errands and work demands are piling up with no end in sight. A difficult Sun-Jupiter aspect today might bring all of this stress to a rolling boil. The full moon next Tuesday in your house of healing and self-care will push you into finding ways to relieve these pent up feelings. Maybe you need to meditate. Perhaps more physical activity is in order. You will find a way.

"
8 april 2017,scorpio,"Get ready for some resistance, Scorpio. People in your world may be as stubborn as mules, refusing to cooperate, listen or complete their share of the work load. This could be at home, the office or in a love affair—so you’ll need to be on your guard! The problem is that you may decide to come on strong with power broker Pluto in your house of communication. Don’t go there, but don’t be a pushover either.

"
9 april 2017,scorpio,"Tuesday’s full moon is a game changer as it will encourage you to cut ties and habits that are no longer working for you. But before the moon looms large in the sky, Mercury retrogrades today in your seventh house of serious partnerships. Are all of your connections solid? Are you working with the right kind of people in business, such as an attorney, booking agent or writing partner? Is a romance budding, or has it reached its sell-by date? Take an honest assessment.

"
10 april 2017,scorpio,"Your imagination is getting fired up with so much planetary activity taking place in the house of the subconscious mind. But should you share your ideas with others? Maybe not. Someone may try to talk you out of a stellar idea as they work their own agenda. Don’t let anyone pass judgment on your passions and brainstorms.

"
11 april 2017,scorpio,"With a full moon in the house of the mind, you may have fears and doubts bubbling to the surface. But you’re in a far better spot than you might realize. Self-esteem isn’t a prize that you win; it’s a part of you that’s already there, a part that you need to get in touch with. Let the fears go. Take control of your thought process and don’t let the monkey mind control you.

"
12 april 2017,scorpio,"What a day for a daydream! The luscious Moon trines inspirational, romantic Neptune. Splendid ideas can percolate in that head of yours, and the best part is that you’re not in fantasy land. Not even close. With the Sun in your practical, efficient sixth house you can take these dreams and flesh them out.

"
13 april 2017,scorpio,"Be patient with those who aren’t moving at the same pace as you, whether it’s their thought process or tasks they’re completing. You’re in one heck of an efficient place, ready to take charge and get things done. You’re also in a good spot to motivate the troops, so put a smile on your face and help them see the light.

"
14 april 2017,scorpio,"An opportunity may seem to come out of the blue at the office: a promotion, a job offer from a competitor or a new prospect who wants to do business with you. The planet Uranus is a real live wire, and it acts up today–in a good way. Likewise, you may simply become incredibly inspired to get a handle on your job or things at home. Go for it, because moments like this don’t happen enough!

"
15 april 2017,scorpio,"If your love life has been stranded on a reef like a ship waiting for the tide to come in, good news–the wait is over. Romance planet Venus has been retrograde in your house of amour for over a month, possibly creating drama, conflicts, jealousy and other problems. Today, however, it resumes direct motion, so matters of the heart can get back on track. Just make sure that things don’t move too  quickly.

"
16 april 2017,scorpio,"Sweet! Venus is now direct in your house of romance and today it winks at lusty Mars in the commitment sector. Hmmm…is someone getting ready to settle down? Or maybe you’re booking some quality alone time with your amour. This is a terrific day for love–enjoy it.

"
17 april 2017,scorpio,"Finally, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Projects or clients that you have been developing are now starting to gel, thanks to a positive Sun-Saturn connection. But before you move forward you need to pay close attention to the details, as El Sol is in your house of efficiency. Your life is about to get busier–clear off your desk and get caught up with the small stuff.

"
18 april 2017,scorpio,"Putting people in their place may be a necessity as the Moon and Pluto meet up in the verbal part of your chart. Just try to keep things rational and don’t get too emo, a possibility with the Moon’s influence. This is a situation that is going to repeat itself in the weeks ahead after Pluto retrogrades on Thursday. So if there are some people who need to be told off and you don’t get around to them today, don’t worry. You will.

"
19 april 2017,scorpio,"Can we talk? Now that the Sun is in your commitment sector it’s time to hold some serious convos with both romantic and business partners. Try to clear the air today if you can, as mighty Pluto is about to retrograde in your house of communication. People may be pushy or not willing to reveal their hand over the next few months, so get ready to develop some patience–and the ability to read between the lines.

"
20 april 2017,scorpio,"Between Mercury and  Pluto both retrograding today, you definitely need to watch what you say and put in writing. Mercury starts to back stroke in your efficiency sector which deals with the day-to-day activities you have to take care of at home and the office. As a result, you need to handle your chores with care and read the fine print on everything from medical insurance premiums to client presentations to your e-mails. People won’t necessarily be upfront with Pluto swimming backwards, so you’ll need to dig for information.

"
21 april 2017,scorpio,"Money can flow into our lives but flow right back out again if we’re not careful. Aggressive Mars is now in your house of fiscal responsibility, which can work two ways. With this aspect you either get serious about saving and cutting down your debt, or you start to spend like there’s no tomorrow. Well, there is a tomorrow and it will be here soon. Get real and save for the future.

"
22 april 2017,scorpio,"Your heart may be saying, “Spend, spend, spend” while your logical brain is clutching on to your wallet with a death grip. Beautiful baubles, shiny new cars, electronic toys and designer clothes may be enticing but the cosmos warns against going on a spending spree. Even if you’re not tempted by big ticket items you could be spending too much on dining out, movie nights and concerts. Cut back a bit and start to save more dinero.

"
23 april 2017,scorpio,"A sweet, flirtatious day lies ahead as love planet Venus winks at the Moon. Plan a fun day with your honey or head out the door to turn heads; you never know who you might meet! The sector that these two are both in also governs art and culture so it’s the perfect day for a gallery crawl followed by cocktails and dinner at an ethnic restaurant. No TV, beer or pizza allowed.

"
24 april 2017,scorpio,"Bringing order to your work flow has a number of benefits, the least of which is lowering your stress level. A powerful Mercury-Saturn trine today also promises more cash coming your way if you start to buckle down and become more productive. After all, if you want to earn more it’s a must that you’re caught up and done with the old projects that were on your desk. Make room for more money.

"
25 april 2017,scorpio,"Shake up the ways you go about running your business or doing your job, Scorpio. We tend to get into a familiar groove when it comes to this, especially if our jobs and incomes are stable. But a superb Uranus-Saturn aspect today tells you to break the old rules and routines and try some more creative methods of getting things done. The good news is that if you’re willing to do so, your income will rise as well.

"
26 april 2017,scorpio,"Business alliances are the way to go over the next six months courtesy of today’s new moon in your partnership sector. Even if you’re used to flying solo, the cosmos advises that you retain the services of a savvy expert who can help take your career to a higher level. It also appears that some profitable new assignments are coming your way, so you may need to enlist the help of others.

"
27 april 2017,scorpio,"A new chapter can open up in romance if you’re willing to put in some effort! Yesterday’s new moon fell in your commitment sector, and its job is to help you enjoy a more balanced and intimate relationship. A happy Moon-Pluto trine enables you to open up the lines of communication. Singles, you should get out there and socialize as much as possible. Face to face beats online these days.

"
28 april 2017,scorpio,"Practicality rules the day as Venus enters your no-nonsense sixth house. This holds true in matters that involve love, family and work. Let others know (sweetly, of course) that you expect them to do their share, which will make for a better situation for all involved. But at the end of the day it all comes down to your personal habits and routines. How solid are they? Are you living a life of ease, or is it one calamity after another?

"
29 april 2017,scorpio,"Setting boundaries with loved ones isn’t always easy but it needs to be done. Strict Saturn is telling you to play by the rules, and if you’re doing that so should the people around you. Don’t give in to guilt trips or head games coming from them. You’re going to be in a no-nonsense mood over the next few weeks and you need to get things done.

"
30 april 2017,scorpio,"Seems like you’ve been raising your standards lately, which is always a good thing! The Moon in Cancer is encouraging you to think bigger and bolder than usual, and the good thing is that the people around you might actually share your vision. Whether it’s a spouse or a business partner, speak up about what’s on your mind. The planets are in quite a collaborative mood.

"
1 may 2017,scorpio,"Like it or not you’re going to need the cooperation of other people over the next few weeks in order to get things done. The problem is that they may not be in the mood to help, or they can’t understand your vision for some reason. The fog will start to clear on Wednesday. And with next week’s full moon in your sign, you’re stepping into a position of greater authority.

"
2 may 2017,scorpio,"Finally, some relief is on the way in your home and office environments. Logical Mercury has been retrograde in your efficiency sector, snarling up even the simplest of tasks. It goes direct tomorrow, but there is a some good stuff going on today: a sizzling Moon-Mars aspect that tells you to start planning your next career coup. Once the full moon arrives next week in your sign, you’ll be unstoppable.

"
3 may 2017,scorpio,"Phew! Mercury is now direct in your house of productivity and getting things done. If you’ve been mired in red tape, surrounded by slackers or held back by inefficient systems you can now move forward. If you spent the past few weeks examining your habits and protocols and then made changes, good for you. If you didn’t then you should start now. Don’t be afraid to delegate tasks to your kids, spouse or co-workers. You’re not a mule.

"
4 may 2017,scorpio,"Winning people over to doing things your way becomes a heck of a lot easier today, thanks to take-it-easy Venus winking at the Moon. This vibe is only going to increase over the next week, dontcha know. That’s because the full moon on the 10th occurs in your sign. Your authority level is rising along with your charisma, but you won’t have to beat anyone across the head to get your point across.

"
6 may 2017,scorpio,"The green-eyed monster might show up on the scene, and it could be coming from the general direction of your friends or a lover. On the other hand it may be you with the envious attitude, so keep it real. Jealously snooping someone’s Instagram or Facebook pages and imagining that they’ve got it better than you isn’t going to help your situation. And if you’re at the receiving end of someone else’s vitriol, don’t get involved. Next week’s full moon is in your sign and you deserve the goodies that life has in store for you.

"
7 may 2017,scorpio,"You may feel like going within today, whether that means resting quietly at home, going for a walk in nature or heading off to a movie by yourself. Sometimes “alone time” is the best way to charge your batteries and to clear your mind. You have an active week ahead in which you’ll be speaking out, mingling with others and pushing hard at work. Don’t feel guilty about resting up.

"
8 may 2017,scorpio,"Pay closer attention to your practical side rather than your emotions, Scorpio. The Moon may be stirring up insecurities and past dramas which are now occupying way too much space and time in your brain. The question is, are they based on reality? Probably not under current planetary conditions, so let them go. Wednesday’s full moon falls in your sign, kicking open new doors. Walk through them unencumbered by the past.

"
9 may 2017,scorpio,"Yeah, baby! Romance gets a lovely reboot thanks to a super Sun-Pluto aspect today. Speak up about what you want from a relationship and what you expect in the future. Make plans to take a quick vacation, maybe a long weekend to a nearby locale. Singles, this is an excellent time to meet a keeper. Face to face is better than online right now, so get out there and mingle. Don’t overlook seminars, book signings, trade shows and hobby conventions as bars have their limits.

"
10 may 2017,scorpio,"Woo-hoo! Tonight’s full moon is in your sign, so it’s showtime, baby. What is that YOU really want to see happen over the next year? Some seeds that you planted in 2016’s birthday season may finally be sprouting, so get ready to enjoy the fruits of your labors. But this is also a smart time to initiate new projects. And even though this lunation is all about you, don’t be surprised if others want to join Team Scorpio. Your can-do attitude has been duly noted.

"
11 may 2017,scorpio,"Your sign is famous for its jealous streak, Scorpio, and even if you’re the most chill scorpion on the planet, you might be feeling bit testy today. That’s because aggressive Mars squares deceptive Neptune, an aspect that might push all of your buttons the wrong way. Obsession, fear, anxiety, resentment and yes, envy—all of these icky little demons might be running rampant. This is most likely to occur in romance. But the good news is that tomorrow is a complete 180, a time when you can work things out calmly.

"
12 may 2017,scorpio,"Feel like starting a meditation practice? Maybe reiki? Or perhaps you want to develop your psychic skills. A vibey trine between Mars and Jupiter sets the stage for going deep within and summoning up the powers of your subconscious mind. Head to a metaphysical bookstore and see what courses or gatherings they might have. Or do your own thing at home with a vision board and online podcasts. It’s time to get in touch with a deeper, more nurturing side of yourself.

"
13 may 2017,scorpio,"You’re becoming a lot more serious about the state of your financial health—or at least you should be, according to the planets! The question is this: are the people around you as determined as you are to save and invest? If you share finances with another person, like a spouse, it’s time to have a talk with them about fiscal responsibility. This includes your kids too. Even if you’re single you should be planning for the future, not waiting for some glorious day in the future when you’ll meet someone and have two incomes to live off of.

"
14 may 2017,scorpio,"It looks like it’s time to get back in touch with a lover and what they’re thinking, Scorpio. Today’s energy gives you the chance to do that, and it would be a wise move on your part to open up the lines of communication. That’s because Mercury enters your commitment sector on Tuesday which will bring up topics of all kinds. Clear the air now while you can! And singles, someone with long term potential may arrive on the scene, so create a short list of the attributes you want them to have.

"
15 may 2017,scorpio,"You may need to gain control over some kind of discussion, group activity or negotiation, whether it’s in your personal life or elsewhere. Just make sure to temper your words with the right tone as aggressive Mars is active today. Otherwise you run the risk of of coming off too emotional or domineering, not the impression you want to give off.

"
16 may 2017,scorpio,"Rebalance your bonds with partners. Develop deeper levels of commitment. Be more willing to give and take. Now that knowledgable Mercury is in your house of committed relationships, you need to clear the air with a lover or business alliance. Singles, the next three weeks are auspicious for finding someone who could be a keeper.

"
17 may 2017,scorpio,"Facing up to issues that you’ve been avoiding becomes a simpler task as the Moon forms a gentle aspect with healing Jupiter. But this is just the preview of a longer period of reflection and closure that begins on Saturday, when the Sun glides into Gemini. Between now and late June you’ll have the opportunity to come to grips with some of your deepest emotions, especially those that deal with love—past and present.

"
18 may 2017,scorpio,"You can make terrific progress with work assignments these days, Scorpio, but the key is to remain focused and block out the office politics and drama. This won’t be easy, because people will be trying to pull you in to the latest gossip fest. If you work out of the house or you’re a one-person operation, you may find yourself dawdling and focusing on insignificant things rather than the big picture. Snap out of it!

"
19 may 2017,scorpio,"“If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.” That can be excellent advice, especially if you’re making good money and your systems at work seem to be operating smoothly. However, a meeting between staid Saturn and spunky Uranus tells you to reexamine your assumptions. No matter how successful you are, there could still be some hacks that will make your work flow more efficiently. And if you’re not earning what you’d like to be making, it’s time to make a change. Figure out how to get on top of tasks, ask for a raise, add a new product or service to your line, switch up your marketing tactics, learn a new trade. Between now and November you can experience a quantum shift.

"
20 may 2017,scorpio,"You’re entering into what could be one of the most prosperous times of the year, thanks to the illuminating Sun gliding into your net worth sector. Over the next four weeks you can negotiate better mortgage rates, pay down debt, enter into profitable business deals or create passive income streams. The problem is that aggressive Mars is in this sector too, which could make you way too anxious to succeed. Anything of value takes time to come to fruition. Also, you may be tempted to spend or take on too much debt, not a wise idea under current planetary aspects. Be circumspect to the point of being thrifty.

"
21 may 2017,scorpio,"It may not be romantic, but let’s face it–relationships need to have a balance when it comes to who’s going to do the cooking, cleaning and child raising. After all, feeling like the hired help in a marriage or live-in situation ain’t romantic either. So if you need to have a little chat with a Significant Other about the level of effort they’re putting into getting the grunt work done, today’s a good time to do so. Singles should streamline their chores to free up more time for play.

"
22 may 2017,scorpio,"Sore muscles, sciatica, allergies, headaches–yuk! Not only do they give us pain but they drain our energy. Fortunately, healing Venus is in a good spot today to help you address the more “minor” health problems that we all have to deal with. (Major problems, the kind that require surgery or more aggressive treatments, are in another house.) Take advantage of this aspect to consult with medical professionals, and while you’re at it, make a vow to eat better and exercise.

"
23 may 2017,scorpio,"Paring down to the essentials is the message that the cosmos has for you these days, Scorpio. This goes for all areas of your life, from the foods you eat to the work projects you take on to the things you buy. It’s time to feng shui everything, which certainly can’t happen overnight. With disciplined Saturn helping you develop positive new routines and habits through December, you can make enormous progress. A nice added benefit? More serenity, less stress.

"
24 may 2017,scorpio,"A funky planetary mix of reality and fantasy are in your chart these days, Scorpio. On the one hand Pluto is telling you to get organized with your chores and avoid unrealistic thinking, especially when it comes to love. Then some other aspects are turning up your libido, which usually clouds our vision! Make time for romance but don’t forget that a solid relationship also depends upon an equitable distribution of chores and responsibilities.

"
25 may 2017,scorpio,"Take baby steps! That’s the message from the cosmos as the new moon occurs today in Gemini. While new moons open doors, and this one is designed to help you score some big money and enjoy love at the same time, you need to take it slow. Aggressive Mars is in “I want it NOW” mode, but wise Saturn demands caution. Know what you’re getting into in love and finance before you join forces with someone else.

"
26 may 2017,scorpio,"You may be on the verge of (finally) getting some of the recognition you deserve, either for a job well done, being a good parent or for a good deed. This may result in some new opportunities coming your way and they could arrive unexpectedly. They say that karma can be a b**** but I say it can also be a blessing.

"
27 may 2017,scorpio,"Money talks and bulls*** walks, as they say. A lot of people around you may be talking  about big bucks but if you want to get your hands on your fair share, you’ll need to be practical—and you’ll also need to be in control. Tough guy Pluto is in your house of brainstorming and strategy, and this little dude recommends that you’re the decision maker. Think about this if someone wants to enter into a partnership, or promises to pay you commission or a piece of the action. Would you be better off doing your own thing?

"
28 may 2017,scorpio,"Tuning in to what other people need is easy this week thanks to a number of planets in your houses of perception and close connections. While you may want to help others, limit your assistance to emotional support and logical advice. Lending money to someone may sour the relationship–and you may not see the money again.

"
29 may 2017,scorpio,"There’s nothing wrong with wanting the finer things in life, but they cost money….and you may not have enough liquidity right now to pay for the things on your wish list. Aggressive Mars is burning a path through your debt sector, and you may be sorely tempted to go on a spending spree. Don’t. Serious Saturn, the logical planet that deals with long term consequences, opposes the red planet today. It’s time for fiscal responsibility.

"
30 may 2017,scorpio,"Mars is pushing your money buttons, urging you to make more. There is an inventive spirit in the air, so a solution may come to you that you hadn’t considered before (and it’s legal, too. No Breaking Bad  here). Whether you figure out a way to impress the boss or decide to get a passive income stream going, it’s green lights ahead.

"
31 may 2017,scorpio,"It’s essential to be open and honest with people today, but the good news is that they will be able to take it! Smooth talking Mercury allows you to chat openly with a lover, business associate, friend or family member. If you make sure to listen to their side of things you can’t go wrong. They need to know that it’s a two way street.

"
1 june 2017,scorpio,"Need to know where a relationship is going? Today’s the time to get this topic out there in the open. Saturn, the planet that puts stability into long term arrangements, is in a super angle to love planet Venus. Already coupled up rams can make concrete, practical plans with their amour. With next week’s full moon approaching in your house of security and guarantees, you need to know exactly where you stand.

"
1 june 2016,scorpio,"Hold on to your wallet, Scorpio! A tense angle between the Sun and Neptune indicates that you and your money could part ways. No, I’m not talking about your pockets being picked. You might be tempted to spend money on something that can wait or be passed up, such as that designer bag that you simply must  have. Luxury items, expensive vacations and toys (cars, electronics), more goodies for the kids–do you really need to buy them? Think feng shui. And retirement that doesn’t include living in a cardboard box under a bridge.

"
2 june 2017,scorpio,"Your financial future gets a terrific boost from one heck of a positive aspect, a trine between the powerful Sun and abundant Jupiter. This is a good time to get approved for a mortgage or line of credit. Maybe a silent partner is willing to finance your business idea. Private talks about a business alliance may take place. Your intuition could guide you to a new way for earning a passive income. But you have to quiet your busy mind first!

"
2 june 2016,scorpio,"Romantic day ahead with the passionate Moon in your commitment sector winking at amorous Neptune in the house of love. This is a good day for singles to meet a new flame and for attached Scorpions to turn up the heat in their relationship. There’s a highly karmic feeling to all of this. Do I dare utter the (much hyped and overused) word “soulmate”?

"
3 june 2017,scorpio,"It’s time to snap back into a steady routine and get a handle on all of your to-dos and work projects, both at home and at work. Fortunately for you, this should be an easy process rather than a gritted teeth exercise. That’s because Venus, planet of ease, is in a sparkling mood today, hooking up with impulsive Uranus. If you need to get your romance into a more structured setup, start planning weekly date nights or working out together at the gym.

"
3 june 2016,scorpio,"As Sunday’s new moon approaches, you’ll be thinking about romance and just how much intimacy, bonding and juicy sex you need in a relationship. Sure, it’s all well and good to share the same values, but a partnership has to have some sizzle. The problem is that today’s Grand Cross will twist your head around worse than an ice cream cone at Tastee-Freez. Do you have a partner who makes you feel secure—but he’s a little too safe? And that red hot sexy mama is sure easy on the eyes, but what’s going to happen when she meets your parents? Don’t make a decision today. Wait until Monday when the Sun sheds some light on your frazzled little brain.

"
4 june 2017,scorpio,"Now that Mars is in the most adventurous part of your chart you’ll be thinking about living life in a more colorful way. Whether you switch up your career, wardrobe, travel plans or personal connections, you’ll be on the hunt for more stimulation. This happens to be a highly philosophical sector, so you might start studying the thoughts and writings of anyone from the ancient Buddhists to modern day self help gurus. The key is to open your mind.

"
5 june 2017,scorpio,"Temper, temper! Keep yours in check today with a tense Neptune-Sun square. You’ll need to keep your wits about you anyhow as this aspect could bring out the more deceptive side of people. Problem is, your mind could start imagining dramas that aren’t based on reality, so even if people are being straight up you may not recognize it. Fortunately level-headed Mercury changes signs tomorrow, enabling you to think with greater clarity.

"
6 june 2017,scorpio,"Dramas that may have been simmering in your love life start to dissipate, thanks to chill Venus entering your commitment sector today. Regardless as to the state of your union–blissfully happy or teetering on the edge of Splitsville–you now have the opportunity to enter into a fa more satisfying and romantic time. Singles, a new love could arrive on the scene, someone with long term potential.

"
7 june 2017,scorpio,"They say that money talks. Other times it whispers, as far as I’m concerned. And now that super smart Mercury is in your house of wealth, you can act like a bloodhound on the trail of mucho dinero. You may have to do some heavy research, but the opportunity to discover prosperous passive income streams is there. Be patient, talk to people in the know and do your homework.

"
8 june 2017,scorpio,"You and a lover could use some quiet time alone to reacquaint yourselves with each other. The same holds true for kids: your own, maybe your grandkids or a favorite niece or nephew. And the key is to spend quality time talking with each other and sharing thoughts, important to do considering that healing Jupiter is in your house of solitude.

"
9 june 2017,scorpio,"It’s always rewarding when long hours, focus and hard work all come together in a successful conclusion, and that’s what might happen over the next few days. Tonight’s full moon in Sagittarius could bring a win, something that has to do with your career or income. Any major decisions you make over the next few weeks will be sound ones, as logical Saturn is in a good angle to the Moon. A new job, assignment or client could come your way in a rather sudden or unexpected manner. Pop the champagne!

"
10 june 2017,scorpio,"Hallelujah. Optimistic Jupiter finally goes direct after being retrograde for four months, during which time you may not have felt so….optimistic! That’s because this usually abundant planet was backstroking through one of the most emotional parts of your chart, the twelfth house. This is the sector which encourages us to close out chapters of our lives that aren’t serving us on our journey, such as bad habits, toxic ties and negative thought patterns. If you did the necessary inner work, you’re now in a good place to move forward.

"
11 june 2017,scorpio,"Decision making becomes easier (and faster) thanks to Uranus, planet of genius, being active today. Your emotions and logical mind will be working in tandem, so you can count on making the right choices.

"
12 june 2017,scorpio,"Keeping your feelings to yourself? Then let them flow as a productive Mercury aspect helps you find the right words. It’s high time that you stood up for yourself. But this isn’t a day for drama; there’s an optimistic vibe in the air that’s healing and abundant.

"
13 june 2017,scorpio,"Emotions could get the better of you today due to a confusing Mercury-Neptune square. You might have your eye on a “bright shiny object”–meaning a hot new lover, a job option that you think will be an improvement, some expensive swag–but you could be getting caught up in the allure of having it. Rely more on logic than desire.

"
14 june 2017,scorpio,"You’ll be in a security conscious mood as the emotional Moon forms a positive aspect with mature Saturn. Instability in love, career, your health or finances won’t be acceptable to you, so do what you can today to shore up your circumstances. Over the next week the realization may hit you that a lot of changes need to be made, and they could be austere.

"
15 june 2017,scorpio,"Don’t be so hard on yourself, Scorpio! Yes, you have a lot on your plate, but there are only 24 hours in a day. Over the next few days you may feel hopelessly behind in many areas of your life. Are you being realistic about your schedule and workload? Sunday is a good time to reflect on this topic and come up with better solutions.

"
16 june 2017,scorpio,"Reality check! Neptune, confusing even on a good day, goes retrograde in your house of romance and children. Don’t let a kid or a lover run circles around you with stories that sound suspicious. Even if they’re being straightforward, it’s possible that they may decide to slack, so unless you feel like being a maid you need to keep them in line. Singles—watch out for sexy but slimy potential lovers who sound too good to be true, not to mention exes who are on the rebound.

"
17 june 2017,scorpio,"One of the most creative phases of 2017 is about to open up for you, Scorpio, so toss out old ideas as to how things should be done and consider some new ones. Now that Neptune is retrograde in your artistic and innovative fifth house, you can plumb the depths of your talent. And when the Sun changes signs next week your ability to think in broader brushstrokes will only increase.

"
18 june 2017,scorpio,"Your head and your heart are working in perfect sync today, so use this energy to work out any questions on your mind. The same vibe reoccurs on Tuesday, so don’t feel as though you have to solve big issues before sundown. Once the Sun enters Cancer on Wednesday you’ll be feeling more optimistic about where you’re heading.

"
19 june 2017,scorpio,"Financial negotiations could get mired in disagreements as Mercury opposes Saturn. These are two of the most logical planets in the solar system, so when they face off against each other it’s not because deception or fantasy thinking are going on. Rather, there may simply be two opposing viewpoints that need to be considered before a decision can be made.

"
20 june 2017,scorpio,"It’s always a good thing when the cosmos lights a fire under our butts to get something done, and today your sign is the lucky winner of the kick-in-the-butt bonanza. The areas that you should be focusing on are your health, fitness level and net worth. Some out of the box thinking may be required, such as finding a new treatment for a health problem, which could require working with a different physician. As long as you’re willing to try new avenues you can make some nice progress.

"
21 june 2017,scorpio,"The lazy, hazy days of summer are officially here north of the equator, but if you’re smart you’ll devote a good deal of time toward achieving what’s most important to you. That’s because El Sol and his buddy Mercury have just entered your house of success. The fact that these two are a team is awesome, because the Sun will fire you up while Mercury enables you to think, prioritize and communicate with decision makers. Don’t worry, you’ll still have time to hit the beach.

"
22 june 2017,scorpio,"Don’t get carried away with yourself, Scorpio! True, the optimistic Sun and vivacious Mercury just entered your “big picture thinking” sector, but tame some of your ambition. In matters of the heart and creativity especially, things may take longer to manifest than you realize. Be patient.

"
23 june 2017,scorpio,"With tomorrow’s new moon arriving in your house of taking calculated risks, you should be thinking about how you can push yourself past your current limitations. Fortunately intelligent Mercury is on the job, helping you find a way to live a more passionate life.

"
25 june 2017,scorpio,"A mish mosh of planetary aspects may find you raring to go one moment, daring to take a chance–and then the next minute pulling back as your subconscious mind stirs up fears and worries. The good thing is that optimism and confidence will win this battle, but it may take til midweek before you feel that way.

"
26 june 2017,scorpio,"They say that kids spell the word “love” as T-I-M-E, and I’d say that the same holds true for your relationship with a lover. A super Mars-Neptune aspect gives you the chance to book some quality time with the people you hold most dear. This energy goes on all week, so make play time a priority.

"
27 june 2017,scorpio,"The initiatives that you take over the next few weeks have success written all over them, as your ability to think big is heightened by so much planetary activity in Cancer. Today a bold stroke of brilliance and creativity may strike, so pay attention to that “theater ” in your mind, the place where new ideas play out.

"
28 june 2017,scorpio,"Bold moves are the order of the day as megawatt Mars encourages you to take a risk. Fortunately, logical Mercury is standing close by, preventing you from doing something really stupid! And if you’re standing on the sidelines, overwhelmed by the prospect of leaping in, remember this old (but corny) saying: “by the inch, it’s a cinch. By the yard, it’s hard.”

"
28 june 2016,scorpio,"Projects with coworkers or team members could hit a snag, and better communication is the key to getting back on track. Jupiter’s presence indicates that overall, the project has excellent long-term potential. Make sure you stick with rational thought rather than emotion to get a point across.

"
29 june 2017,scorpio,"With so much planetary activity in your adventurous house of big thinking, you’re more than ready to dive into something new. But someone nearby might be hell bent on pulling you down to Earth with a bump. It could be a lover, family member or co-worker, but it also could be Big Brother. Do you need a special license or permit? Does a banker need to see a business plan? Be prepared to do some explaining to the people who are putting up walls.

"
29 june 2016,scorpio,"Keep your eyes and ears open for an opportunity that could improve your finances, as something may crop up unexpectedly. It could be office gossip that suggests that someone is leaving (therefore opening doors for you), an idea for a business or a new way of handling workplace flow that will result in greater profits down the road.

"
30 june 2017,scorpio,"You need a time out, Scorpio. Any kind of project that the world will see needs to be refined before it’s ready for prime time. This could be your resume, a dance performance, your wedding plans, a product launch, a college application or a manuscript. With the Moon in the house of inner wisdom, ask yourself what needs to be tweaked.

"
30 june 2016,scorpio,"Hold on to that wallet, babe! Luxury-loving Venus is telling you that you deserve all sorts of expensive treats, but Pluto on the opposite side of the solar system is saying, “No way!” The recent full moon on the 20th fell in your income sector, designed to help you earn more. Make sure you save some before you start spending it.

"
1 july 2017,scorpio,"A little mystery is always helpful in a girl’s (or guy’s) arsenal, so be a little more secretive and alluring when it comes to matters of the heart. Schlumping around the house in stretched out sweats with a beer bottle in your hand may feel comfortable, but it ain’t sexy. Time to become an agent provocateur.

"
1 july 2016,scorpio,"Nothing but green lights ahead! Scorpio, you are the envy of the zodiac, as two of the most helpful planets in our solar system are linked arm in arm today. Venus and Jupiter are telling you to toss aside restrictions, outdated notions, fear, and lack of confidence…and to go for it.

"
2 july 2017,scorpio,"Trying to start over with a clean slate, a new beginning? That wouldn’t be surprising with Mars in your optimistic house of grand ideas. But other people may be attempting to either confuse you or “help” with what they think are the facts. While it’s wise to listen to experts, in the final analysis you have to make your own decisions.

"
2 july 2016,scorpio,"What does security mean to you? A half million dollars in the bank and a fleet of exotic cars, or just a few thousand bucks and a steady job? Today’s expansive planetary aspects ask you to reconsider your ideas as to what you think it will take to make you feel safe and content. You may find that you actually need less!

"
3 july 2017,scorpio,"Over the next week you may consider taking a chance of some kind, something that will take your life to a far more interesting place. Today is a good time to not only think about it, but to discuss it with someone close. If you feel the need for confidentiality, however, know that you can still receive “advice” of the cosmic kind. Tour intuition is strong, so use it.

"
3 july 2016,scorpio,"The planets are pushing you out of the “same-old, same-old” lifestyle into something that’s more fun, creative and expansive. The next two weeks could be life-changing, as you’re being asked to overhaul all aspects of your existence to live more vibrantly. A jubilant Sun-Neptune trine today tells you to get some artistic mojo going. You don’t have to take art classes;  just make a commitment to spend more time with hobbies, buy some fresh flowers, and add more color to your place.

"
4 july 2017,scorpio,"Confidence is sexy, and you’re going to end up in the perfect place this week to experience that. Today amorous Venus enters your house of libido and intimacy, and then on Wednesday Mercury glides into your house of authority and success. Gotta love this combination!

"
4 july 2016,scorpio,"It’s time to take a chance on something that you’ve been considering for awhile, something that will help you grow as a person. Today’s new moon in the most progressive part of your chart will enable you to go after your dreams, and in a more creative manner than you’re used to!

"
5 july 2017,scorpio,"With amorous Neptune retrograde in your romance sector, you may be having second thoughts about a romantic partner. This isn’t about leaving them, mind you–it’s more about figuring out the best way to get through to them. Perhaps you want more quality time, a baby or a ring. If you’re single you could be questioning the type of person you’ll connect with next. It’s all good, and it’s quite necessary.

"
5 july 2016,scorpio,"A romantic relationship can turn over a new leaf with a positive Mercury-Neptune trine. It’s a good day to talk things over, especially if you’re getting ready to take things to the next level. Yesterday’s new moon should have you in an expansive state of mind, ready to grow.

"
6 july 2017,scorpio,"There may be things that you have always wanted to do, but never had the guts to pursue. Well, now that the Sun and Mars are both in your adventure sector your confidence should be rising. A Jupiter-Sun square could bring up old fears, but wash them away like the morning tide. Your logical mind hasn’t disappeared; it will guide you in the right direction.

"
6 july 2016,scorpio,"Your optimism should be going through the roof, courtesy of a fabulous Mars-Venus trine and the fiery Sun high-fiving Mercury. This is one of your best days all year to set passion projects in motion, whether it’s starting a family or kicking off a business idea that’s been rolling around in your head. But the planets tomorrow are in a difficult place, warning you not to discuss your ideas with others quite yet. You also need to pay close attention to the details. Just how are you going to achieve these goals?

"
7 july 2017,scorpio,"Your ability to prioritize and accomplish important plans gets a boost from Venus, now in the most insightful part of your chart. The next few weeks are perfect for conducting research, lining up potential investors, figuring out financing and coming up with a smart strategy. This is true in your personal life as well as your private one, so cast a wide net.

"
7 july 2016,scorpio,"Wings clipped? You may feel that way, as strong planetary forces oppose your optimistic spirit. Colleagues may not be in agreement about a work project, and bosses and clients may be picky. If you are planning any sort of major launch or enterprise—an advertising campaign, a wedding, putting together a proposal—you may get mired in red tape or details today. But this is beneficial, as it forces you to slow down and make sure that everything is perfect.

"
8 july 2017,scorpio,"With tonight’s full moon in your house of self expression, now is a wonderful time to get your opinion or message out there. Talks with a lover should go just as well as a conversation with the boss or potential client. Your creativity should be off and running thanks to enriching Neptune in a helpful angle, making this a great time to pen a novel, rebrand your company, polish up your art portfolio or shamelessly promote your bad self.

"
8 july 2016,scorpio,"Any venture that you undertake that uses technology should shimmer today, Scorpio! Whether you’ve decided to check out online dating sites, start a blog or design an app, your prospects for success are excellent. This vibe continues over the weekend and into Monday, so work with the energy on offer.

"
9 july 2017,scorpio,"The recent full moon was in your house of self expression, and you may be raring to go: socializing with others, launching a media campaign, writing a book, teaching, negotiating deals, and creating artwork. But the planets warn that you need to take your time: make sure that your systems work, that employees or partners are doing their part, and that your message is on point.

"
9 july 2016,scorpio,"No man is an island, as the saying goes, and the current planetary lineup suggests that teamwork is the way to go right now. A fortuitous meeting between promising Jupiter and the spontaneous Moon indicates that you could join forces with another, be it a romance, friendship, business venture or neighborhood association. With long-range Saturn in your security sector, this is an alliance that could stand the test of time.

"
10 july 2017,scorpio,"It’s a “walking on eggshells” kind of a day, so be careful about what you say to others. Tough guy Pluto is active in your house of communication–a little too  active, I must say! You run the risk of appearing pushy or obnoxious, even if you’re trying to help someone. Step back and let this cosmic energy pass.

"
10 july 2016,scorpio,"Wild horses can’t hold you back these days, Scorpio! With Mars in your sign you’re a force to be reckoned with. Your mind is in a good place, thanks to the fiery Sun and intelligent Mercury telling you to take more chances. A personal growth workshop or a seminar may be just what you need to learn new skills and develop fresh perspectives.

"
11 july 2017,scorpio,"If you are seeking solutions or answers, look no further than yourself. Abundant Jupiter is active in your intuition sector, suggesting that you take some time today to meditate or quietly focus on what you need to do next.

"
11 july 2016,scorpio,"Balancing act! That’s what you’re going to have to pull off as you charge forward with your plans. With Venus, Mercury and the Sun all in your high-flying ninth house, you may be ready to take on the world. But you can’t neglect the grunt work and the details that are involved. A tense Mercury-Uranus square could throw up a roadblock.

"
12 july 2017,scorpio,"You got that mojo rising, Scorpio. Creativity gets a big boost thanks to the Moon entering your house of talent and skill development. Things may have been stuck for awhile, but now they can spring forward. Run your ideas past like-minded people, a smart idea considering that the recent full moon was in your house of synergy.

"
12 july 2016,scorpio,"As the Sun advances toward the sign of Leo, you should be thinking about where you’re headed in your career. Your aspects for success are excellent, thanks to profitable Venus entering Leo today. This will give you a jump start when it comes to taking action that will lead to changes. Considering that Venus is the planet of ease and diplomacy, the old saying about catching more flies with honey than vinegar applies here. It gets better: quick-thinking Mercury goes into this part of the sky tomorrow, helping you self-promote, negotiate and impress.

"
13 july 2017,scorpio,"Inspiration strikes today with a luscious Moon-Neptune aspect. These are two of the most passionate orbs in the solar system, so when they meet our minds can become full of possibilities. Don’t keep your thoughts to yourself either–share them, as the recent full moon’s energy is perfect for networking and growing closer to the people you care about the most.

"
13 july 2016,scorpio,"If there was ever a time to promote your talents, Scorpio, this is it! Chatty Mercury is now in your house of ambition, joining lucky-bucks Venus. But you may want to consider a new way of reaching out to people, as transformative Pluto wants you to think out of the box. The full moon next week on the 19th is stellar for wrapping up a marketing plan, ad campaign, resume prep, or client presentation.

"
14 july 2017,scorpio,"Sometimes the best way to get ahead in life is to keep your head down, stay out of the spotlight, don’t make a lot of noise and soldier your way forward. Leave bragging and one-upmanship to lesser mortals. Besides, surprising the hell out of them later on will be so  rewarding.

"
14 july 2016,scorpio,"Pushy, pushy! Aggressive Mars has spent a good deal of time in Scorpio this year, lighting a fire in you to get things done. Problem is, not everyone is operating on your super-charged time frame. You may find that out today as unpredictable Uranus provokes someone, most likely a co-worker or client, to act out. Take it slow and listen to their point of view. Taking a “my way or the highway” attitude won’t work.

"
15 july 2017,scorpio,"Inspiration strikes in a big way, so take your bright ideas and run with them. With the Moon in the most creative part of your chart, you can come up with all sorts of unique and artistic solutions. Once Mars and the Sun enter Leo next week there will be no stopping you.

"
15 july 2016,scorpio,"Now that Venus and Mercury are in the most ambitious part of your chart, you’re no doubt thinking about your next move. A wonderful meetup between the Moon and Saturn today will help you get closer to your income goals. While bringing home more money is nice, so is loving what you do for a living. La Luna asks you to consider that as you focus on the green stuff.

"
16 july 2017,scorpio,"A sudden burst of motivation will hit you to get moving with something, from a diet to a project that’s been sitting on your desk, and that’s a good thing. What’s not helpful is trying to blaze your way through it at warp speed, a possibility with aggressive Mars in a tough angle. Take your time.

"
16 july 2016,scorpio,"Yowza! The planets are packing a powerful punch today, and it’s all in your favor. First, a Mercury-Venus meetup in your tenth house of ambition and career makes you the go-to guy or gal for the job. Then a beneficial trine between the fiery Sun and energetic Mars tells you to think beyond old boundaries and perceptions of yourself, and what you’re capable of. The sky’s the limit.

"
17 july 2017,scorpio,"You may be over the moon about a goal, dream or project, but that’s the problem–your feet need to be firmly planted on the ground. If you don’t get real about this, someone else will be more than happy to point it out. Don’t give them the satisfaction.

"
17 july 2016,scorpio,"Your aspects for career advancement are terrific this week as the Moon glides into your third house of negotiating, commerce and connections. A profitable angle between Uranus and La Luna today could bring an idea for expanding your client list or streamlining your office procedures. Not everyone in the company will be on board with your ideas, but you’re not going to care. Mercury and Venus in your authoritative tenth house will put you in charge.

"
18 july 2017,scorpio,"This is one of the most soulful days of the month for you Scorpio, as Venus and Jupiter connect in the vibiest parts of your chart. Don’t be surprised if you start considering a meditation practice, studying Zen Buddhism or analyzing your dreams. It’s a cathartic energy, so release what’s no longer serving you.

"
18 july 2016,scorpio,"Talk is cheap, as the saying goes, but not for you, Scorpio! With transformative Pluto in your communication sector forming a fabulous angle with the Moon, your ability to convey your thoughts leaps ahead. Tomorrow’s full moon falls in this part of the sky, opening up a brand new cycle in which you can talk the talk while you walk the walk.

"
19 july 2017,scorpio,"Your career is about to heat up big time with the Sun and Mars both entering Leo within the next 72 hours. But you can get a jump start today thanks to a helpful aspect that links smart negotiator Mercury with long term Saturn. Let the wheeling and dealing begin.

"
19 july 2016,scorpio,"A powerful full moon in your house of expression closes out a period in which you may have felt that your voice was not being heard. Now is the time to speak up, self promote, write that book or screenplay, blog, teach or counsel. With so much positive planetary energy in your career sector, the next week is superb for interviewing or making client presentations. Your coworkers may be miffed at your newfound eloquence and ability to present bold new ideas, but let ‘em stew.

"
20 july 2017,scorpio,"Hope you’re well rested! Aggressive Mars enters your house of ambition and success, its first visit here in two years. While you can make amazing progress with your goals, you also run the risk of burning out. Pace yourself–Rome wasn’t built in a day.

"
20 july 2016,scorpio,"When the Sun moves into Leo on Friday, your ambitions will be front and center for four glorious weeks. But the cosmos dishes up a little appetizer today with a yummy Venus-Saturn trine. Start letting the world know how talented you are. Ask for the job, the raise, the promotion, the deal. Saturn is in your house of income, providing a powerful earnings boost to whatever you decide to undertake.

"
21 july 2017,scorpio,"Too many chefs spoil the sauce, as they say, and so does nitpicking over every little aspect of creating it. You are either dealing with paralysis by too much analysis, or a group of people who desperately need one direction to follow, not ten. The key is to become focused without losing sight of one  big picture.

"
21 july 2016,scorpio,"Something is going to happen today that will remind you that friends and family are a key part of your happiness. Is it time to plan more quality hours spent with the people you love most? With so much planetary energy pushing you to expand your career, a balancing act is necessary. Go after the green but don’t forget your tribe.

"
22 july 2017,scorpio,"Your career and other big ambitions take off like a rocket now that the Sun has joined Mars in the success-conscious part of your chart. Between now and August 21st is an excellent planning and implementation stage. The real progress is made after the solar eclipse in Leo on 8-21.

"
22 july 2016,scorpio,"Here’s the good news: the Sun has entered Leo, your tenth house of career advancement. You have four weeks to make progress with your ambitions. Now for the not-so-good news: unpredictable Uranus goes retro in your house of co-workers and work assignments on the 29th. This means that you’ll be dealing with flaky colleagues, employees and clients who will wimp out, drag their feet or be indecisive for several months. Keep your eye on the prize and work around them.

"
23 july 2017,scorpio,"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines. The new moon in Leo is your green light to get moving with key goals. The problem is that erratic Uranus is acting up in your sector of organization and systems. This means that before you get started, you must ensure that you have the proper habits, people and routines in place.

"
23 july 2016,scorpio,"A juicy Moon-Neptune conjunction falls in your house of romance today, setting the stage for a sweet day ahead. Singles should get out there and mingle, while attached Scorpios should plan a nice evening out. It’s also an inspirational time for artists and creatives, as visionary Neptune will stir your desire to bring out more of your talents.

"
24 july 2017,scorpio,"Practicality rules today, so don’t get caught up in wishful thinking or denial. If someone or something isn’t right for you, make a choice and then move on. The good news is that you can develop momentum quickly as you head off into the sunset.

"
24 july 2016,scorpio,"There seems to be a lot going on behind the scenes at the office, Scorpio. Here’s the good news; your star is on the rise. So much so that you may be thinking of asking for more responsibility or moving on, courtesy of today’s optimistic Moon-Sun trine. The problem is that your co-workers may not be carrying their share of the load. With Uranus going retro this Friday, they may slack even more. Keep that in mind.

"
25 july 2017,scorpio,"People around you may be full of advice, and you would be wise to heed it. Find a mentor or good friend whom you can bounce ideas off of. With Mercury now in your tech sector, online advice could also be helpful: webinars, podcasts or blog posts that cover the topics you’re interested in.

"
25 july 2016,scorpio,"It’s not just what you say but how you say it that counts. Pluto, the great transformer, is stationed in your communication sector, aiming to make you more persuasive, eloquent and respected. Whether you’re a mom trying to get your kid to clean his room or a CEO trying to mobilize the sales team, make sure that your desire for change–NOW!–doesn’t come off too aggressively. Choose your words carefully for maximum impact.

"
26 july 2017,scorpio,"Yowza! Big day in the cosmos as the Sun and Mars meet up in the heavens, and in your case they’re talking about your big goals and dreams. Nothing  is going to stop you from going after what you want. Just make sure that you don’t mow people down along the way!

"
26 july 2016,scorpio,"Pick a partner! Metamorphic Pluto is helping you learn new and better ways to communicate, whether it’s how you talk to your kids or your writing style for that blog or proposal. Today a positive Moon-Pluto aspect suggests that you might want to consider partnering up with someone who can assist your progress.

"
27 july 2017,scorpio,"Who’s on your squad? Consider that carefully over the next 72 hours now that the Moon is in your discerning twelfth house. There’s no room for fake friends, players or people who want to hold you back. As if they could! Please.

"
27 july 2016,scorpio,"Impressive! A positive Mercury-Uranus trine helps you impress the boss, key client, judge or banker with your savvy. With the Sun now in the most ambitious part of your chart, you can make a lot of headway over the next four weeks. Just make sure to have all of your facts and figures organized and at the ready.

"
28 july 2017,scorpio,"Keep your lips sealed over the next 48 hours, especially if you’ve been working on something behind closed doors. The same holds true if you are privy to a secret or confidential information. Loose lips will sink ships–make sure you don’t go down like the Titanic.  

"
28 july 2016,scorpio,"With enterprising Mars in Scorpio, you’re ready to rock and roll. But some tense aspects over the next few days may make you feel like you’re wading knee-deep through mud. Today a person close to you, such as a romantic partner or business associate, may voice opposition to your plans. But when Mercury enters your house of dream achievement on Friday, it’s all systems go.

"
29 july 2017,scorpio,"Anyone who has been giving you attitude lately either needs to be knocked down a few pegs, or you have to decide to ignore them. Both strategies have their advantages. You have so much planetary energy encouraging you to achieve that you can’t waste time on trolls.

"
29 july 2016,scorpio,"Some people have finessed the art of burning a candle at both ends, but that’s not the best MO for you over the next five months. Nope, Uranus is now retro in your wellness sector which means that it’s time for some serious self-care: nutritious meals, plenty of sleep, vitamins, and sensible exercise (86 the idea of a triathlon if you’re not in shape). You’re going to need the stamina! Co-workers could slack, clients might be indecisive and red tape at the office could turn into a crimson tide. Just say “ohhmmmm.”

"
30 july 2017,scorpio,"Taking care of wonky emotional situations becomes easier today with a pleasant Venus-Uranus aspect. You need to have more stability in your life and less drama, and now’s a good time to find it. Maybe you need better habits, maybe others need to respect boundaries. Figure it out and enjoy the peaceful results.

"
30 july 2016,scorpio,"The company you keep will become more important than ever, Scorpio, now that chatty Mercury has entered your house of networking and camaraderie. The next four weeks are awesome for attending parties, socializing and making new friends (not to mention new love interests!). Collaborations and group projects also sing, so you might get involved in volunteer work or an industry association. Got an idea for an app, blog or tech product? Go for it, as this is also the house of the digital world.

"
31 july 2017,scorpio,"With so many planets in your house of ambition, you should be raring to go. And today magnetic Venus glides into your house of optimism and thinking in broad brushstrokes. Over the next three weeks you could completely overhaul your ideas about what’s important to you, and chances are you’ll be thinking even grander than before.

"
31 july 2016,scorpio,"The devil is in the details. Don’t skip over them, as producing error-free work is crucial right now. It doesn’t matter if you’re putting up drywall in the basement or working on the mother of all Power Point demonstrations, don’t rush your efforts. And while you’re at it, throw in some creative flair. Inspirational Neptune is dousing you with artistic mojo.

"
1 august 2017,scorpio,"Feeling philosophical as you try to figure out which direction to head in? It’s not surprising with Venus now in your house of deep thinking. And with next week’s eclipse occurring in the house of developing stronger roots and connections with loved ones, you need to think about how your actions will affect the other people in your world.

"
1 august 2016,scorpio,"As far as money and career go, Scorpio, you’re the envy of the zodiac. Venus and the Sun put your ideas front and center, so don’t be afraid to out them out there. Whether you’re making a presentation to your staff or clients, trying to impress a new boss or a group of bankers, getting ready to launch a marketing campaign or go the entrepreneurial route, you’ve got the right stuff.

"
3 august 2017,scorpio,"Sports psychologists will tell you that the main thing that separates a pro from an amateur is not so much talent, but their habits. And from your chart it looks like yours can use some updating. Brilliant Uranus goes retrograde today in your efficiency sector, warning you to update your routines before things start to fall apart!

"
3 august 2016,scorpio,"With yesterday’s new moon in your ambition sector, you’re more than ready to move ahead with career goals. But how?

"
4 august 2017,scorpio,"Optimism is usually a healthy attribute but sometimes it can make you vulnerable to opportunists.

Fortunately both the Sun and Mars are in your house of authority, so you’ll have no trouble standing your ground.

"
4 august 2016,scorpio,"Some tense angles in the cosmos may find you questioning whether you’re ever going to be able to afford your more ambitious goals, whether it’s a dream house, a trip around the world or leaving the day job for entrepreneurship. But the good news is that Mars and Saturn are working behind the scenes to increase your income. When Saturn goes direct on the 13th, momentum will start to build.

"
5 august 2017,scorpio,"Ready to have a happier home life and greater commitment? Not surprising with the upcoming eclipse in your house of contentment and stability. A Sun-Neptune aspect today suggests however that you  are going to be the one to get this feeling in place, which may mean becoming a wee bit authoritative.

"
5 august 2016,scorpio,"With Venus entering your house of acquaintances today, it wouldn’t be surprising if you spent some time reflecting on the quality of your friendships. The emotional Moon is in a questioning mood, asking if certain alliances will stand the test of time. Even if someone has been in your life for decades, if you sense that they don’t have your best interests at heart, it may be time to move on.

"
6 august 2017,scorpio,"Trying to hold a sane conversation with someone today could feel like pushing a two-ton boulder uphill, so why bother? No matter how diplomatic you may be, it takes two to make things work. By the time of tomorrow’s lunar eclipse you may not even care anymore about this conversation, so let it go.

"
6 august 2016,scorpio,"With Mars and Saturn both blazing a path through your security-conscious second house, no doubt you want some kind of a guarantee–in romance and your finances, for starters. But Venus and Mercury are opening your eyes to some enticing possibilities that might require taking a risk. What’s a Scorpio to do? Wait until after the 13th to make a move. Saturn moves direct, helping you see things clearly.

"
7 august 2017,scorpio,"Something big is coming to a grand finale, Scorpio, something that will put a smile on your face. A lunar eclipse in your fourth house of family, home and emotional security should bring some happy events your way within the next six months: a baby, new home or finding true love. Interestingly your career is well aspected too, so a breakthrough could occur that makes you feel grounded and maybe even wealthier!

"
7 august 2016,scorpio,"With three planets in your gregarious eleventh house of camaraderie, chances are your open to meeting lots of new people and welcoming them into your circle. But a tense Mercury-Neptune opposition advises you to choose your companions wisely. Not everyone should make the cut. Make sure that you’re not hearing what you want to hear, especially from a romantic partner.

"
8 august 2017,scorpio,"Emotional issues can be put out there on the table for discussion today. But don’t wait for someone else to make the first move; seize the reins and be the one who opens up the lines of communication. You might end up being surprised at how level-headed and objective you are. Let’s hope that others are the same way!

"
8 august 2016,scorpio,"Be careful what you ask for–you might get it! That’s the message from the cosmos today. With the Moon in the house where we dig deep and seek answers, it’s a good time to consider what you really want out of life. You need to be true to yourself, and not worry about the opinions (and lifestyles) of your friends and family. Chiron, the wounded healer, is in a good angle, suggesting that once you realize what you’re seeking, as sense of relief will come over you.

"
9 august 2017,scorpio,"With both the Sun and mighty Mars in your house of authority, you are definitely a force to be reckoned with. But the manner in which you get your point across needs to be switched up a bit. Maybe you need to come on stronger, or be more gentle. In business, maybe you should be scheduling more face time versus texting. Consider the best way to go, then make the right changes.

"
9 august 2016,scorpio,"Over the past few days you may have been wondering about whether some connections are worth it, Scorpio. It could be friends, a lover or a group you’re associated with, and your time–not to mention your serenity–should be protected.

Your intuition is running high these days, and it’s suggesting that you try new ways of getting things done. Consider some fresh new approaches and give them time to gel.

"
10 august 2016,scorpio,"When in doubt, talk it out. A terrific Mercury-Pluto trine encourages you to run your ideas and concerns past a trusted confidante or mentor today. Pluto is changing the way in which you process information and make decisions, which is a good thing, but it may have you second-guessing yourself. Reach out to someone whose good judgment you can rely on.

"
11 august 2017,scorpio,"Behind the scenes business deals and confidential interviews are the order of the day. If you’re looking for a new job, this is a superb time to start making inquiries. Just don’t tell the entire free world of your plans.

"
11 august 2016,scorpio,"As the Moon gets ready to glide out of Scorpio, it reminds you to get moving on an ambitious plan that you’ve had under consideration. La Luna will be swinging past energetic Mars and logical Saturn in your income sector later in the day, so whatever you’re working on has good long-term profit potential, not to mention the ability to bring you some well-deserved kudos.

"
12 august 2017,scorpio,"Egads–Mercury retrogrades today in your teamwork sector! Projects can get knocked off track as people disagree about who’s responsible for what, the creative aspect of the endeavor, the budget or the best way to get things done. This sector also governs technology, soooo…….back up your data, don’t post anything inappropriate online, and don’t expect website and social media launches to take off like a shot.

"
12 august 2016,scorpio,"It may be Friday and your mind is on happy hour and the weekend ahead, but….Saturn goes direct tomorrow in your income sector! While that’s worth drinking to, it’s also wise to think about new income streams you can develop, asking for a raise or getting involved in a startup on the side. Your plans may have been stuck or even derailed over the past few months, maybe from undercapitalization, but that’s about to change.

"
13 august 2017,scorpio,"Stepping into your own power becomes a heck of a lot easier with today’s magnificent Sun-Saturn trine, a cosmic event that will be felt for days. Feeling more in control will help you in all areas of your life, from love to money to your friendships. Just beware of becoming too vocal, a probability on Tuesday.

"
13 august 2016,scorpio,"If you have felt stuck in a romantic relationship or a job over the past few months, good news–Saturn goes direct today. The ringed planet has been in your second house, the place of security, both financial and emotional. You may have felt hemmed in by a person or organization, as this is the house of rules and routines. Finally, progress can be made. Whether you stay or go is up to you, but don’t expect change overnight, as Saturn moves slowly on a good day!

"
14 august 2017,scorpio,"With so much planetary activity taking place in your career and success sector, you may be neglecting something very important, and it’s called “fun”. As in—vacations, cultural events and mingling with people who have a fresh perspective on the world. Set aside some play time now before next week’s eclipse sets your sights on work in a big way.

"
14 august 2016,scorpio,"While being coy and playing flirty romantic games can seem like sexy fun, a Venus-Neptune opposition advises you to play it straight today and into early next week. Be direct and leave no room for interpretation. And if someone else is playing this game, they may be not be as serious about love as you think they are.

"
15 august 2017,scorpio,"“Everyone is entitled to my opinion!” Someone–hopefully not you–is in that kind of mindset, and they won’t be afraid to be obnoxious. Remember, you can’t take words back once they’re out.

"
15 august 2016,scorpio,"Going it alone right now isn’t the smartest plan! Indeed, the planets are urging you to team up with others in order to live a happier, more productive life. With the Moon and Pluto together in your house of communication, reach out to friends, neighbors, other parents, industry contacts or anyone else you can think of who can help smooth the path ahead. You can make some new friends and enjoy the trip a lot more.

"
16 august 2017,scorpio,"Sometimes in matters of the heart ya just gotta take charge, and today is one of those days. Don’t let a lover (or even a child) make promises to you that they have no intention of keeping (“I’ll clean my room” or “I’ll leave my wife”). Let them know that there’s a new sheriff in town–nicely.

"
16 august 2016,scorpio,"Feeling ambitious? You should be, considering that the fiery Sun is in your house of achievement and success. But what’s the best path to take in the days and weeks ahead? Answers to that question may appear today in a very spontaneous manner, as innovative Uranus is in a fine angle to the Sun. Why take the slow road when you can be in the fast lane?

"
17 august 2017,scorpio,"Screech!!!! The brakes get slammed on a venture or plan of yours that was developing momentum. Fortunately this is just a bump in the road and will pass quickly. But you do need to consider whether you’re being overly optimistic about the time frame or outcome that you have in mind.

"
17 august 2016,scorpio,"Progress! There’s an atmosphere of mutual agreement in your chart today, which can lead to effective and gratifying discussions with others. Pluto is helping you learn to communicate in a new and more dynamic way, which will help smooth relationships of all kinds. With tomorrow’s full moon in your house of security and contentment, you’re headed for a more serene place.

"
18 august 2017,scorpio,"Taking risks looks mighty tempting with a Moon-Venus meet-up in the most adventurous part of your chart. Fortunately with Monday’s eclipse occurring in the most structured, conservative yet ambitious sector, you can mix taking a chance with some serious logic.

"
18 august 2016,scorpio,"Security increases in your financial affairs as a full moon in your sector of security and comfort takes place. With the Sun forming a harmonious trine to maverick Uranus, you could be at the receiving end of an offer to work someplace new, or to take on more responsibility where you currently work. Self-employed Scorpios could suddenly land a new client or deal that puts a smile on their face. But are your lover or kids peeved that you may be putting in longer hours? Make sure they don’t get left out in the cold.

"
19 august 2016,scorpio,"With three celestial orbs at odds with each other today in the heavens, you may feel torn as to which task to attend to first. Mars and Saturn in your second house of routines are working to develop smarter, more efficient ways of getting things done. You have big plans for the future, but in order to achieve them you have to get down to the dirty details. Clarity will increase between now and next Wednesday.

"
20 august 2016,scorpio,"With so many planets in your house of friends and camaraderie, you’ll be more than ready to meet up with pals for drinks, dinner or a party. But the Moon opposes the fun and games from your house of romance. Spending too much time with the boys (or girls) and not enough with your honey? Or maybe you’re simply finding it hard to balance your time with all the people you love, such as family and kids and a lover. You’ll be able to figure this out after Monday when the Sun enters Virgo.

"
21 august 2016,scorpio,"Ready to hear that old cash register ring? I’ll bet you are, and with the Moon in entrepreneurial Aries, you might be super motivated to drum up a new source of income. One of the best days this year to state your case for a raise, look for a new job or research starting a business is this Wednesday. Start the planning now.

"
22 august 2016,scorpio,"It’s not only what you know but who you know over the next four weeks, Scorpio! The Sun enters Virgo, your house of friends, teamwork and camaraderie. Even if you tend to go things alone, you’ll be tempted to team up with folks for work as well as pleasure. With a marvelous Jupiter-Mercury conjunction today you might get hit with an inspirational idea, something that’s much bolder than previous plans. Get ready to run with it, as planetary aspects later in the week will support its success.

"
23 august 2016,scorpio,"It’s time to get real about your finances, Scorpio, as Mars and Saturn are holding a summit conference on that topic tomorrow. But this is a good thing. Mars will give you the ambition to earn more while Saturn blesses you with the discipline to make new habits stick. Today’s Moon-Neptune angle tells you to focus first on expenditures that deal with children, entertainment, sports, hobbies and your spouse or lover. No one’s telling you to not enjoy life, however! Just make a realistic budget and stick to it.

"
24 august 2016,scorpio,"A dazzling day in the cosmos! Power brokers Saturn and Mars meet up for an important convo in your income sector. It’s a superb time to impress others with your resume or a presentation. One caveat: don’t let anyone see that you’re anxious or hungry, a possibility with Mars involved. Also, think long-term, a must with Saturn on the case. Whatever you get started today can take you far.

"
25 august 2016,scorpio,"Your earning power is on the rise, Scorpio, thanks to an auspicious Mars-Saturn hookup yesterday in the heavens. But don’t spend it before you make it! The Moon is stirring you up to pad your portfolio with more cash, but a tough angle between La Luna and the other two power brokers means that being fiscally conservative is the key. Others in your circle may be tempting you to spend, but maintain the long view and keep the plastic in your wallet.

"
26 august 2016,scorpio,"Cue Diana Ross and the Supremes: “You can’t hurry love, no you just have to wait! Love don’t come easy, it’s a game of give and take.” Got that? Because if you try to pressure someone today chances are it will backfire. The problem is that murky Neptune is making a lover hard to pin down. It’s also possible that you  are on the receiving end of a demanding amour and you’re not willing to communicate. Let this pass and wait for better vibes on Monday.

"
27 august 2016,scorpio,"A collaboration may be in the works, something that you may want to consider taking part in. Whether it’s an industry gig, a neighborhood association or just planning a vacation with your friends, it has success written all over it. That’s because lucky Jupiter and magnetic Venus are meeting up in your house of camaraderie today, an event designed to introduce you to more people–and that includes a lover.

"
28 august 2016,scorpio,"This could be an emotional day in love, but this is a good thing. A happy trine between the Moon and Chiron, the wounded healer, enables you to see beyond limiting thoughts from the past that may be holding you back in romance. This is true whether you’re single and looking or already involved with someone. Sometimes it just takes a fresh perspective to make a difference.

"
29 august 2016,scorpio,"Choose your friends and associates wisely, Scorpio. Mercury is about to go retrograde in this part of your chart tomorrow. If you suspect that there’s a frenemy in your midst, you need to weed them out. Fortunately for you, magnetic Venus enters the house of the subconscious mind today, ramping up your intuition. Pull away a bit and observe before making decisions.

"
30 august 2016,scorpio,"You’re already known for being a vibey, intense individual, but now that Venus is in your house of intuition you will become even more in tune with the unseen realms. Good thing, because Mercury retrogrades in your house of camaraderie and teamwork. If there are any faux friends or associates in your midst you’ll sniff them out faster than a police dog. This is also the house of tech projects, so there could be delays with a website launch, social media or developing an app. Take your time and do it right.

"
31 august 2016,scorpio,"Tread warily with technology today, whether it’s a post on social media or getting ready to launch a new website. Mercury has just gone retro in the house that governs the digital world. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse in this area promises that tech projects can be winners, but you need to work out the kinks first.

"
1 september 2016,scorpio,"It takes two to tango, but a group of dedicated people to take a venture and make it go viral. And with today’s solar eclipse in your house of teamwork, the people you surround yourself with over the next few months will make a huge difference in your life. Whether it’s a charity, volunteer organization, political party, singles meetup or industry gathering, groups are the way to go. A side benefit is that the eclipse occurs in your house of technology, so a digital project can really make headway in the months to come.

"
2 september 2016,scorpio,"With quick-thinking Mercury and optimistic Jupiter teaming up in the area where we focus on our dreams and goals, you’ll have no shortage of brilliant ideas for your future. But a T-square in the heavens creates tension as the demands and agendas of friends and lovers tug on you. Remember, it’s your life. Don’t try to keep up with your comrades or live a duller life to keep someone else happy.

"
3 september 2016,scorpio,"This is a fabulous weekend for getting out there and meeting new people, as the Moon connects with lucky Jupiter in your house of networking as well as love planet Venus. The new faces you meet could be instrumental to big events in your future, such as finding a spouse, landing new business opportunities and making close friends. With Mercury retrograde, contacts from your past could be in touch.

"
4 september 2016,scorpio,"With structured Saturn trying to bring you long-term stability in all areas of your life, you’re going to want to associate with people who have your best interests at heart. Your intuition will be strong today as you ponder just whom you can count on and trust. This isn’t to say that you have enemies lurking in your midst. But sometimes it’s better to rely on a smaller, more tight-knit group than a great big posse.

"
5 september 2016,scorpio,"Questions about stability or security in a partnership may arise due to some difficult angles in the cosmos. Saturn is hell bent on trying to line you up with romantic and business alliances that will stand the test of time. But Neptune is swirling its mist, perhaps making you feel emotional and unsure of what the future brings. When Jupiter enters vibey, metaphysical Libra on Friday your intuition will be your best guide.

"
6 september 2016,scorpio,"Networking with others is the way to go right now, thanks to a beneficial Moon-Sun-Pluto connection. It doesn’t matter if you’re trying to find new love or a new job, or just make friends with likeminded people. Just don’t push too hard, a possibility with Mars on the scene. You may be anxious for more security but you run the risk of turning people off if you come on too strong.

"
7 september 2016,scorpio,"A sparkling trine between the Sun and Pluto will create a new dynamic in teams and groups that you’re associated with. You’re coming into a more powerful, respected position and your words have weight. It’s possible that decision makers have noticed your skills and are considering you for bigger and better things—with more money attached to them.

"
8 september 2016,scorpio,"Two of the best words in the English language are “cash flow”, especially if the adjective “substantial” precedes them! You’re going to be highly energized to earn more money as the Moon connects with both ambitious Mars and disciplined Saturn in your income sector. Neptune, however, is kicking up a fuss in your house of entertainment and luxury, urging you to spend, spend, spend. Follow the more practical path.

"
9 september 2016,scorpio,"Retreat, recover, release. These are the watchwords for you over the next 13 months as healing Jupiter has entered your twelfth house of introspection, closure and nurturing. Treating yourself with extreme self-care is what it’s all about. Rid yourself of bad habits and cut toxic ties. This is also a time for wrapping up projects that have already begun; however, if you want to kick off a new initiative, your imagination and creativity will be off the charts.

"
10 september 2016,scorpio,"Neptune is the planet of fantasy, and it’s playing with your head today, Scorpio! Above all, you must be realistic in matters of the heart, especially when it comes to your security within a relationship. Which means: don’t assume that the married man you’re seeing is really going to leave his wife. Stop looking at wedding gowns when you’ve only been out on 3 dates. Having a baby isn’t going to heal a broken romance. If your logical mind is telling you that something is off, then it is.

"
11 september 2016,scorpio,"Keep your antennae up today as someone may be more interested in their own needs than yours. Pluto, the planet that deals with power-hungry people, is at odds with Venus, creating a situation in which you need to protect your own interests. But the good news is that Venus is in your intuition sector, enabling you to figure out what’s going on behind the scenes.

"
12 september 2016,scorpio,"The company you keep is the focus over the next few days, and with Mercury retrograde in your friendship sector you could hear from an old pal. But choose your acquaintances carefully, and that includes people you team up with at work and after hours: socializing, charity or volunteer work, in the neighborhood or your daily workout. Some connections may not be worth the trouble, especially if certain people expect you to play roles that simply aren’t in your interest.

"
13 september 2016,scorpio,"Playing by the rules may not be as exciting as going off the grid, but the cosmos is warning you to keep to protocols and routines this week. The upcoming lunar eclipse on Friday is stirring you up, encouraging you to think on a grander scale. There’s nothing wrong with raising the bar and trying to achieve more, but you must back up your dreams with a solid plan.

"
14 september 2016,scorpio,"Most of us are working for a living, but let’s face it, some jobs or occupations are more secure than others. And in your case, an auspicious Moon-Mars-Uranus angle could provide you with inspiration that will lead to a greater sense of safety. Maybe it’s a home-based business that you can run on the side, or a dazzling money-saving idea that you can pitch to the boss. If you’re self-employed or work on commission, you could streamline your operations. After all, time is money.

"
15 september 2016,scorpio,"With tomorrow’s eclipse falling in your house of romance, you may be giving a lot of thought to love, whether you’re already committed to someone or just looking. With Mars burning a path through your house of security, you could be way too anxious to hear some kind of promise: a ring, a baby, or “this time I’m going to change, it will be different, I swear!” You want less drama and more of a routine, but pushing hard may backfire. Let the eclipse shine its light on your next move.

"
16 september 2016,scorpio,"Matters of the heart are spotlighted by today’s lunar eclipse in your house of romance, fun, and children. Something big could be coming to an end, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing: your days of being alone and single, your years of being childless, your self-esteem being trampled by an unappreciative lover. If you’re happy in love, things can suddenly jump up to a higher level (wedding bells? renewing your vows?). But if you’re not, this lunation could be the last straw that pushes you into a much better place.

"
17 september 2016,scorpio,"“Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.” This quote from Eleanor Roosevelt pretty much sums up your mindset today. Think about ideas, great ones, as assertive Mars trines the planet of genius, Uranus. Don’t be surprised if the people around you are uncomfortable when they hear what you have to say. You’re probably going to be way ahead of the pack, and it will take them time to realize that your ideas have merit.

"
18 september 2016,scorpio,"Sometimes you just have to throw out the “Rule Book of Life” and make your own regulations! A Venus-Uranus opposition today might spur you suddenly to rethink how you go through your day. If you’re always dutifully taking care of this errand or that chore, it’s time to make some more time for you–and carve that in stone!

"
19 september 2016,scorpio,"As an astrologer I’m always happy when I see planets in the secretive twelfth house signal planets in the income sector, because that means that hush-hush money talks can take place. That’s what you have on tap today as Venus and Mars hold a confidential meeting about your earnings. If you’re not already talking to someone, start now–about a raise, new job or how to start your own business.

"
20 september 2016,scorpio,"If you’re involved in any kind of group effort—a charity, the PTO, an industry think tank, a team at the office—you may need to go back and rework a project that’s on the table. Likewise, the roles of the people involved and their duties may also need to be switched up. But this is all for the good as intelligent, chatty Mercury forms a trine with transformative Pluto. The positive energy continues into the weekend, so make the most of it.

"
22 september 2016,scorpio,"Sshhh! The Sun enters Libra, the most secretive, hidden part of your chart, the house of the subconscious mind. But don’t think that this will be a quiet time. You can achieve a lot, and the best way to go about that is to pull away from the madding crowd and work alone as much as possible.  This is your best opportunity all year to break bad habits and negative thoughts patterns, as well as cutting toxic ties.

"
23 september 2016,scorpio,"Fantasy vs. reality—balancing them is today’s challenge! A Moon-Jupiter square could place you firmly in Lala Land, daydreaming (or worrying)  about things that may have no basis in truth. Keep it real. There’s nothing wrong with having dreams, but if they spin out of control, so could you.

"
24 september 2016,scorpio,"It’s a great day to hang with your friends or party with the tribe, courtesy of a happy Mercury-Pluto trine. Avoid the tendency though to spew out opinions that your pals may not be ready for. It’s also possible that you could be on the receiving end of unsolicited advice. Keep things light.

"
25 september 2016,scorpio,"It’s time for a reboot of Scorpio 2.0. Magnetic Venus is now in your sign, which is perfect for a makeover. A fresh new attitude would go along well with some stylin’ new clothes and hair. The Sun and Jupiter are urging you to toss outdated versions of yourself in the garbage, along with the crummy feelings surrounding things that didn’t work out. Next!

"
26 september 2016,scorpio,"Sometimes closure can be painful and other times it can be as smooth as silk. The latter holds true today as the Sun and optimistic, healing Jupiter meet in your twelfth house of letting go. This annual meeting is considered to be one of the best moments of the year, so use it to your advantage. Dump bad habits, see a therapist if need be about past hurts or substance abuse, and consider leaving toxic arrangements that are sucking the life out of you. Clearing out the dead wood allows inspiration to flow in, and the next 12 months could see your talents go through the roof.

"
27 september 2016,scorpio,"Curb your enthusiasm! Now that dynamic Mars is in your chatty third house of self-expression, you can push forth with studies, writing projects, socializing, and self-promotion. But watch the tendency to come on too strong, a possibility with Mars and dynamic Pluto in this part of your chart. Go after these projects with zeal; just remember that not everyone will share your eagerness or intensity.

"
28 september 2016,scorpio,"A happy Moon-Mercury angle in your house of friends and networking is encouraging you to connect with as many people as possible these days, whether it’s for work or pleasure. Today is great for reaching out and making plans. But there could be some dissension coming from a lover who feels neglected, or kids who want you to log some quality time with them. Likewise, make sure that you’re not spending all your time with business cronies–you need some time for you.

"
29 september 2016,scorpio,"A group or team effort may need to be adjusted, and quickly at that. A meeting between the Moon and spontaneous Uranus indicates that roles, protocols or future plans should be examined and changed if need be. You might also want to take a look at your personal goals, as it seems that you should alter your approach to achieving them.

"
30 september 2016,scorpio,"With so much planetary energy in your hush-hush twelfth house, you may be wondering if you’re going to ever be in the spotlight. Well, you should be this weekend, as a terrific Venus-Neptune trine occurs. Venus is in Scorpio, making you look like the hottest thing on two legs, and Neptune is in your house of romance. Plan a sexy date night out on the town! Singles, make sure you circulate—and you’re not sporting dirty hair or some shapeless schmatta.

"
1 october 2016,scorpio,"Hmmm…got a secret crush on someone? Or perhaps someone is lusting after you without your knowledge. A new moon in your hush-hush twelfth house today is accompanied by a meeting of the two most romantic planets in our solar system, Venus and Neptune. Matters of the heart could be simmering sexily behind closed doors. Likewise, over the next few months you could be involved in a number of activities that you’re keeping quiet, such as sourcing a new job or moving to a new location.

"
2 october 2016,scorpio,"You may feel pressured to make a decision about something but it appears that you don’t have all the facts yet. Take off any rose colored glasses you may be wearing, get real, and then determine the most efficient or practical way to proceed. Listen to your own wisdom than the advice of friends or a romantic partner, as you know what’s best.

"
3 october 2016,scorpio,"With charismatic Venus in your sign you can sweet talk people in ways that may not have been possible earlier this year. The issue is that A Venus-Pluto link could encourage you to take things a little too far, using manipulation or trying to turn things to your advantage. It’s best to be straightforward, as subterfuge could backfire as early as this Thursday.

"
4 october 2016,scorpio,"Getting to the bottom of an issue should be much easier these days, thanks to smooth-sailing Venus in your sign and the Sun in your house of intuition. Today you may be questioning your security, be it in romance, your career, or just your overall sense of certainty. Both your sixth sense and logical mind can help you immensely.

"
5 october 2016,scorpio,"With Venus in your sign you should be feeling open and at ease with how you present yourself. But over the next few days you may reconsider what you say and how you say it, as planets in your intuitive twelfth house warn you to keep your opinions (and psychic hits) to yourself. Today is still favorable for being candid with a happy Venus-Pluto aspect, but once Thursday rolls around it’s better to be discrete.

"
6 october 2016,scorpio,"When in doubt, check it out! Your brain could be sending you mixed signals today, with your intuition telling you one thing and your rational mind saying something completely different. Don’t make any big decisions under this aspect, which will continue tomorrow and resurface again before the 15th. If you must bring something to a conclusion before then, do what Ben Franklin did: the old pro and con list.

"
7 october 2016,scorpio,"You’ve been in a pretty vibey place over the past few weeks thanks to hosting the Sun and Jupiter in this part of your chart. Today energetic little Mercury joins them, helping your sixth sense operate at warp speed. The only problem here is that you may start reading too much into everything, searching our subtle nuances when there are none to be found. Also, with brash Mars in your house of communication, you run the risk of blabbing every thought that comes into your head. Filter, please!

"
8 october 2016,scorpio,"My, my, aren’t we chatty! With the Moon, Mars and Pluto all piled into your communication sector no one could blame you for being a social butterfly this weekend. With magnetic Venus in your sign, you’ll have no trouble finding pals and admirers who’d like to spend time with you. Amorous Neptune is in a gorgeous angle from your romance zone, so your biggest problem is going to be deciding who you’re going to spend your time with!

"
9 october 2016,scorpio,"You’re in an excellent position to self-promote, one of the best times in years as a matter of fact. With Venus in Scorpio and Mars and Pluto in your house of writing, lecturing, drawing, and socializing, you should be getting your message out there to the world. Just don’t expect everyone to be as excited as you are, especially when it comes to co-workers or employees. Someone may try to throw a monkey wrench into your plans, so stay on your toes.

"
10 october 2016,scorpio,"No more settling for table scraps! A cleansing Venus-Chiron aspect tells you that you no longer have to settle for less in life. It’s not your karma to put up with toxic people or be involved in an unhappy relationship. Getting up and going to a soul-sucking job every day isn’t part of some cosmic master plan. With Venus in Scorpio, you should be considering other possibilities–and they should be better ones.

"
11 october 2016,scorpio,"Many people, if asked if they would rather have peace of mind over money, will choose the former. After all, what use is money if you’re ravaged by fears, doubts and anger? Scorpio, you’re in luck today as a happy meeting between Mercury and Jupiter in the house of your subconscious mind opens the doors to peace. The doors to the higher mind will open too, bringing you wisdom from the cosmos, along with an amazing burst of inspiration. Take this gift and run with it.

"
12 october 2016,scorpio,"Tiptoe around others in the week ahead, and keep your opinions to yourself! A filter will  be needed as your intuition is in top form, helping you analyze situations with incredible quality. But that doesn’t mean that the people around you want to hear the unvarnished truth. Let them figure things out for themselves instead.

"
13 october 2016,scorpio,"You could be privy to a secret….or perhaps you have you own! Either way, the planets warn you to keep them to yourself as a “loose lips sinks ships” vibe is prevalent in the cosmos. This is especially true in the workplace, as a number of planets are active in your earnings and colleagues sectors. If you’re looking for a new job keep that juicy piece of information to yourself.

"
14 october 2016,scorpio,"If you’ve been thinking about getting rid of some habits that are not exactly helping you on your journey, now’s a good time to toss ’em. Candid Mercury is in the house of the subconscious mind, telling you to get real–and to get moving by replacing them with smarter routines and alternatives. Better yet is that Saturn, planet of discipline and long term success, is in an auspicious angle as well.

"
15 october 2016,scorpio,"Finish what you’ve started, Scorpio! Some tense angles today in the cosmos demand that you put an end to anything that’s been dragging on for far too long: your divorce, term paper, bad habit, cluttered closets or negative thought patterns. Do what it takes to clear out the detritus from your life, which may mean having some serious conversations with others—or yourself. A supermoon tomorrow in your efficiency sector can help you blast through these things like a hot knife through butter.

"
16 october 2016,scorpio,"Ready to make progress? If that’s the case today’s full moon in Aries has your name written all over it. You may decide to hire someone to help you with your tasks, such as a nanny or house cleaner. Or you may decide to hire a new employee at work, contract out tasks to an outside source, or streamline your routine. Efficiency is the name of the game here. You could become so motivated that you also decide to get fit through a diet and exercise regimen.

"
17 october 2016,scorpio,"Yesterday’s full moon in Aries should be firing you up to become more efficient and healthy, but old habits die hard. With the Sun in your habit zone, you may be putting up resistance to making changes. Or maybe you’re telling yourself that certain things (like a diet) didn’t work out before…so why bother? This time they will. With structured Saturn in a terrific spot, sticking to new routines should be much easier than expected.

"
18 october 2016,scorpio,"The planets are aligning to put more money in your pocket, always a bonus! The recent full moon in Aries was all about blasting through your work, becoming more productive and landing new clients and assignments. And today profitable Venus enters your income sector for a few weeks, so you’re in the perfect spot to make headway. Start shopping your resume, talk to the boss about a raise, and create a workable budget.

"
19 october 2016,scorpio,"Keep those famous scorpionic barbs under control today! A high wattage meet up between Mars and Pluto could impel you to speak your mind, which isn’t necessarily a problem as long as you’re diplomatic. Problem is, Mars isn’t exactly the planet of diplomacy, and Pluto is all about demonstrating personal power. As a result you could come across as overbearing under this influence. But if played right, you can also appear to be dynamic, self-assured, intelligent and well-spoken. The choice is yours.

"
20 october 2016,scorpio,"Something could happen today that will make you realize that you have some “inner work” to do. Maybe it’s a comment from someone. Maybe it’s an old unhappy memory that keeps playing like a tape on a repeating loop in your head. Whatever it is, consider it as a gift from the cosmos, even if it brings up uncomfortable feelings. Of all the signs you’re in the best place to get your s*** together mentally.

"
21 october 2016,scorpio,"Frustration with your daily routine could mount today with a Moon-Mars-Pluto opposition. You may long to get away from mundane details and the “little stuff” in order to focus on the big stuff. But duty calls, and it’s wise to take care of projects that are in front of you rather than jump into new endeavors. Overwhelm will catch up with you pretty quickly otherwise.

"
22 october 2016,scorpio,"Yee-ha! Your big bad birthday season is officially here, Scorpio! And it falls on a Saturday, so why not get the party started this weekend? A side bonus is the entry of Mercury into the same part of the sky on Monday, perfect for polishing up your speaking skills and overall self-image. People will want to hear what you have to say, so make sure that you look and act the part of a winner. It gets even better around the 30th, when a glorious new moon occurs in Scorpio. Love planet Venus is huddled nearby, suggesting that some amorous times are ahead.

"
23 october 2016,scorpio,"You might be scratching your head over a remark made by a lover or child today, as confusing Neptune is active. But the watery planet forms a good angle to optimistic Jupiter, indicating that you can get to the bottom of the matter—without screaming and a lot of drama! Mighty Jupiter happens to be in your house of intuition, so your gut hunches could be right on target. Use it to figure out what’s going on.

"
24 october 2016,scorpio,"Birthday season gets even brighter as Mercury joins the Sun today in your sign! The next few weeks are excellent for self-expression—the way you dress, the image you project, what you have to say, impressing others with your ideas and enjoying your creative side. A stellar day for dazzling others is Thursday when the Sun and Mercury form a conjunction in the heavens. Shine on!

"
25 october 2016,scorpio,"Just what do you want, really? In love, your family life and even your lifestyle? Today’s planetary aspects will produce a tug of war in which the need to grow and expand will come up against the desire to remain in a comfortable little box. There’s nothing wrong with wanting security as long as it doesn’t suffocate you. Neptune, planet of inspiration, is quite active today, pushing you to think and live creatively, but Venus is holding you back. This vibe soon passes—so take a little risk if a big one scares you!

"
26 october 2016,scorpio,"Money matters get a boost today with a hush-hush Jupiter-Venus aspect. These are the two planets that govern profits, so the fact that they’re winking at each other across the heavens is a good sign. Know that lucky Jupiter is in your house of confidentiality, so if you’re hunting down a new job keep it quiet. The same goes for heading the entrepreneurial route. Tomorrow is an excellent day for brainstorming.

"
27 october 2016,scorpio,"The cosmos delivers a nice birthday gift in your lap today: a conjunction of the Sun and Mercury in your sign. This means that these two form a perfect line in the heavens, blending their energies. With the Sun providing you with insight and authority, and Mercury stimulating your intellect, you’re in the perfect position to step into your own power and claim it. Better yet, others will see you as someone that want to date, marry, hire, befriend and collaborate with. As Mercury is the planet of expression, make sure to get your message across: verbally, in writing, any artwork you’ve produced and also your self-image.

"
28 october 2016,scorpio,"A healing vibe in the cosmos helps you move past feelings of unworthiness in love. Likewise, you don’t have to play the role of enabler, or put up with situations that aren’t the best. Chiron, the wounded healer, allows you to vent your emotions, whether it’s to your lover or a trusted friend. This is also an auspicious time for opening up the lines of communication with a child, letting them know that they have to take on some responsibility.

"
29 october 2016,scorpio,"Something may come out of left field today that will throw you off guard, perhaps putting a monkey wrench in your plans. It could also be a remark or attitude from someone that you don’t quite appreciate. But the good news is that a serene Venus-Saturn angle will help keep you grounded. And with tomorrow’s new moon in Scorpio, you’ll become even more focused on your own thoughts and contentment.

"
30 october 2016,scorpio,"Happy birthday Scorpio! Today brings a happy event–the annual new moon in your sign. Use this lunation any which way you please to inaugurate positive changes in your life over the next twelve months. The energy of a new moon is strongest two weeks afterward, but continues on for about six months. Craving more love and romance? Then you’ll be pleased to know that the two most amorous planets, Venus and Neptune, are in fabulous angles to the moon. Get out there and circulate, because a hot prospect could be right around the corner.

"
31 october 2016,scorpio,"With the moon swinging past the Sun and Mercury in you sign today, you may be highly motivated to go after something (or someone!) that makes your heart sing. Your creativity is off the charts these days, as well as your desire for love and affection, so reach out and grab that brass ring.

"
1 november 2016,scorpio,"The recent new moon in your sign frees you up to follow your heart, pursuing passions and dreams that may have only recently seemed like a fantasy. You’re in an enviable spot when it comes to inspiration, considering that enriching and expansive Neptune is in your house of imagination. Today the Sun forms a harmonious angle with the watery planet, allowing you to really get clear about the details of your goals and aspirations. Grab a pad of paper and brainstorm away.

"
2 november 2016,scorpio,"Keep a lid on major things that you’re working on at the present moment. With the Sun in your house of ambition, no doubt you’re tackling some of your most cherished goals and dreams. But that doesn’t mean that everyone needs to be in the loop; as a matter of fact, they shouldn’t be. Power broker Pluto in your confidentiality sector tells you that true strength comes from discretion. Keep some nuggets of information to yourself.

"
3 november 2016,scorpio,"You’re an idea factory as of late, Scorpio, and this is a good thing! But don’t ignore the input and opinions of other people as they could provide a fresh look at a situation. As a matter of fact, finding a mentor, teacher or savvy expert right now could be just the ticket to making progress. This vibe repeats itself on Monday of next week, so start putting out your feelers now.

"
4 november 2016,scorpio,"Your self-confidence should be rising along with your desire to achieve some new goals, thanks to hosting several planets in the house of you—Scorpio. But keep an eye on those around you who may want to hitch their wagon to your star, or those who may try to talk you out of your plan of action. You don’t need anyone’s approval or advice unless you seek it yourself, and from a qualified mentor at that.

"
5 november 2016,scorpio,"Keep your schedule flexible this weekend as erratic Uranus may throw a few curveballs your way. Unexpected errands and last minute changes are on the planets’ agenda. But some of these events could hold a silver lining as they may open your eyes to new ways of scheduling your chores and getting the grunt work done.

"
6 november 2016,scorpio,"Throw caution to the wind and take a chance! Maverick Uranus is telling you to break out of your usual routine and try something new. You may feel that your stuck in a particular schedule–the hours at the job, chauffeuring kids around and getting your errands done on the weekend–but you have some degree of control over your free time. Schedule in some quality time, just for you.

"
7 november 2016,scorpio,"Excellent day to get your point across with authority and eloquence! The Sun is spotlighting your ideas, desires and image, so don’t hold back when it comes to expressing yourself. Put the finishing touches on proposals, contracts, manuscripts, written assignments and artwork before Mars leaves Capricorn on Wednesday.

"
8 november 2016,scorpio,"It seems that you need to take control over the less glamorous things in life, such as getting the food shopping done, balancing your checkbook and getting caught up on your e-mails. Do so now, otherwise you may be facing a mountain of chores over the next five weeks. A clean house is a serene house, and the less clutter you see on a daily basis the calmer your mind will be.

"
9 november 2016,scorpio,"With a full moon next week in your commitment sector, things may be reaching critical mass in a romantic or business partnership. You are craving security as Mars just entered your fourth house of contentment. If you’re not sure where you stand, chances are you’ll be demanding answers, but you won’t have to resort to heavy handed tactics. Silky smooth Venus will put the right words in your mouth once it glides into Capricorn on Friday.

"
10 november 2016,scorpio,"Home is where the heart is, and it should also be the place where you can pamper yourself and indulge in your favorite activities. A Moon-Neptune connection recommends creating a home “art studio” or basement workshop where you and your loved ones can spend time on hobbies that soothe your soul. While you’re at it, go the spa route in your bathroom with some delicious smelling candles and bath potions.

"
11 november 2016,scorpio,"You may feel compelled to speak your mind openly, courtesy of easy going Venus now in your house of reaching out and connecting. But a difficult Moon-Jupiter aspect today warns to keep your opinions to yourself. Confidentiality is the name of the game over the next few days. The end of next week is far better for getting your opinions heard.

"
12 november 2016,scorpio,"It’s time to put some of your ideas to the test, Scorpio! Intelligent Mercury has just entered your income sector, so if you have some money or time saving ideas, by all means put them into motion. With smooth-as-silk Venus in your chatty house of relating to others, you’ll have no trouble when it comes to making a pitch or closing the deal.

"
13 november 2016,scorpio,"Now that Mercury is in your house of earning more cash, you should be focusing on saving some dinero for home related purchases. Whether it’s simply splurging on some new pillows and bedding or socking away a large lump sum for a down payment on a house, make preservation of capital your #1 goal.

"
14 november 2016,scorpio,"Things could be reaching critical mass in a romance as a full moon/super moon occurs in your house of relationships. The same holds true for close business alliances, whether it’s a standard partnership or someone who’s on retainer to represent your interests. You and a lover may not be in agreement as to what you want out of life and there could be “creative differences” in work situations. With easy going Venus in your communication sector, however, you have the opportunity to discuss matters and smooth them over.

"
15 november 2016,scorpio,"Emotional and financial security are quite important to you and have been over the past year, thanks to hosting serious Saturn in your safety sector. You can make terrific progress today with developing both, but the key is to keep a realistic mindset. Don’t give in to flattery, vague promises or rose colored glasses kind of thinking. You need to be the captain of the ship.

"
16 november 2016,scorpio,"A sudden burst of energy can be all you need to start moving on a project, whether it’s redecorating the bedroom or kicking the smoking habit. With so many planets in a practical, can-do mood, you can make a lot of progress. But the best part is that your sense of serenity and emotional contentment will rise along with the completion of your goals. Get moving!

"
17 november 2016,scorpio,"Confusion may reign at the office as a number of planets are sending mixed signals. Employees may be difficult to corral; co-workers may need more direction, and it seems that you’re the one who may have to take charge. Be careful what you say and how you say it as there could be someone working against you behind the scenes. Next week is a far better time to be vocal and get your point across more strongly.

"
18 november 2016,scorpio,"Watch the temptation to push a lover for a decision today, a possible scenario with an ornery aspect involving Neptune. Passive-aggressive tactics won’t work, so don’t even go there. With Mercury in your house of security you need answers to be sure, but this is not the time. Wait until next week when the Sun enters Sagittarius, at which time you’ll have more clout.

"
19 november 2016,scorpio,"You’re in a bit of a flux, Scorpio. On the one hand you want excitement and fun; on the other you want stability. It’s not impossible to have both and with Neptune resuming direct motion today, you can. This is especially true in matters of the heart, and with a stellar Venus-Neptune aspect you should be reaching out to your amour to discuss some juicy future plans. No lover in sight? Then start socializing locally this weekend as it’s an awesome time to meet someone new.

"
20 november 2016,scorpio,"As the Sun prepares to leave your sign tomorrow, spend some time reflecting on where you’re headed next. A wonderful Moon-Uranus trine today could provide sparks of inspiration. Consider talking to a coach or mentor in the days ahead if you need guidance. Likewise, what skills do you need to develop or polish up in order to achieve the things that are closest to your heart?

"
21 november 2016,scorpio,"Pluto, the planet of metamorphosis, is actively changing the way you think, talk and express yourself in writing and other creative methods. And now that the Sun is in your income zone, this is a honey of a time to start viewing yourself–and your earning power–in a completely different light. Instead of just searching for the next promotion, job or deep-pocketed client to boost your income, why not focus on how you can be innovative instead? Standing out from the crowd can pay off far more handsomely.

"
22 november 2016,scorpio,"Sometimes it’s wise to take a step back from projects that you’re working on in order to take a quiet assessment, and today is one of those days. With lucky Jupiter in the house of inspiration and the mind, your ability to consider what needs to be done next is heightened. Perhaps you simply need to switch up your habits and routines. Maybe you need more money, or the help of an influential person. Whatever it is, take action, but wait until next week. The new moon on the 29th is custom made for initiating changes.

"
23 november 2016,scorpio,"As the holidays approach many people throw caution to the wind as they spend, spend, spend, but not you, Scorpio. A stern meeting today between rational Saturn and intelligent Mercury is all about being fiscally responsible, not only now but in the year ahead. This is an excellent time to review your spending habits, budgets and goals, both at home and at work. If you own a business it’s critical that you know where the money is going—and where the revenues will be coming from.

"
24 november 2016,scorpio,"The holidays are here, but are you ready for socializing? A Pluto-Jupiter square today indicates that you may only be in the mood for small groups or people who really put a smile on your face. And that’s OK. Life is too short to spend it with people who are difficult. So if you have to spend time with folks who aren’t your type, a Jupiter-Pluto aspect suggests that you keep your opinions to yourself and just chill.

"
25 november 2016,scorpio,"If it’s been difficult for you to say what’s on your mind lately, the cosmos will assist you today. Jupiter, the great benefic, is in the house of your deepest thoughts, encouraging you to release pent up emotions so that you can heal and move on. But a tense aspect with Pluto may have made you reluctant to speak out. Venus comes to your aid now, allowing you to vent. Let it flow.

"
26 november 2016,scorpio,"Money talks, and it’s shouting at you today Scorpio! A super Mercury-Uranus trine can get your creative juices flowing, enabling you to brainstorm ways to earn more. A former boss or colleague could call you with a job offer, or you could figure out ways to land more clients or revenues. Get ready for a busy time ahead in which you can make loads of progress.

"
27 november 2016,scorpio,"Whose life is it, anyway? You may need to draw a line in the sand with family members, household chores or extracurricular activities that are taking up too much of your quality time. That’s because your mind is filled to capacity with thoughts that don’t allow in fresh new ideas. Make a commitment to book time just for enjoying life.

"
28 november 2016,scorpio,"Partnership talks can take a more serious turn this week as Tuesday’s new moon falls in your house of security. This lunation can also boost your feelings of self-worth, whether you’re involved with someone or not, so get ready to feel better about your bad self. Confidence is sexy, and everyone wants to be around a winner.

"
29 november 2016,scorpio,"A new moon in your earnings sector is perfect for developing a new income stream, finding a higher paying job or creating a workable budget. With Saturn in an excellent angle, whatever you set in motion now can bring in cash for decades to come. Abundant Jupiter is also helpful, blessing you with inspiration for profitable ideas. But don’t spend it before you make it, and make it clear to the people around you that you’re not a money tree. You also have to overcome the desire to spend on unnecessary items that are “must haves”. Sorry, but luxury spending is going to have to wait awhile.

"
30 november 2016,scorpio,"Inspirational Neptune has set up shop in the house that deals with your skills and talent, which is always helpful. But today the watery planet faces off against the practical Sun. The message? Sometimes it’s not enough to have flashes of brilliance. Even the most talented surgeons, musicians, public speakers and teachers take classes to further develop their abilities. And so should you. Seek out a mentor, read a book, attend a seminar or sign up for a class. No one is perfect.

"
1 december 2016,scorpio,"A sweet sense of calm can wash over you as Jupiter and Mars trine each other in the heavens. If you have been doing a lot of “personal work”—trying to break a habit, becoming more mindful, releasing the negativity from past dramas—today can bring about a much desired breakthrough. And with chatty Mercury entering your house of expression on Friday, it’s time to let others know how you feel and what you think.

"
2 december 2016,scorpio,"You’re an idea factory these days, Scorpio, thanks to hosting Pluto and Venus in your house of thinking and self-expression. Get ready for your brain waves to hum along at an even faster clip now that intelligent Mercury enters this house today. This aspect is also good for socializing, neighborhood affairs, going back to school, blogging or writing. Brainstorm now, then go over your ideas with a magnifying glass after the 19th when Mercury goes retrograde.

"
3 december 2016,scorpio,"Relationships with family members can improve dramatically in the weeks ahead. With Mercury in the house that deals with siblings, and Mars in the sector that governs your parents and kids, now’s the time for healing rifts. When Venus enters Aquarius next Wednesday it should be even easier. But today you need to let loved ones know that you do have expectations about getting chores done. While you’re at it, remind them that money doesn’t grow on trees.

"
4 december 2016,scorpio,"Your serenity and sense of contentment are becoming more important to you these days, and that’s a good thing. With so many planets active in your family, work and love sectors, you could be busier than a one-legged man in a butt kicking contest. Today a healing aspect encourages you to come up with ways to defuse and chill, whether it’s via meditation, scheduling more down time for yourself or sharing your thoughts with people who can help you find peace.

"
5 december 2016,scorpio,"Getting along with co-workers is not always an easy task, but planetary aspects this week indicate that a surprising turn of events may take place. Maybe the office diva leaves the company; perhaps the boss finally straightens out people who need to be dressed down. But it could also be a slight change of attitude on your part that will will help reframe the situation so that you don’t care as much!

"
6 december 2016,scorpio,"You may be in the mood for some down time, sequestering yourself away in your own little cocoon. And there’s nothing wrong with that, except that cosmic activity indicates that others may need your participation or help. Now. This theme reappears several times between now and Christmas, so be prepared to cooperate. However, you will get the chance to chill as Venus enters your warm and fuzzy house of domesticity tomorrow.

"
7 december 2016,scorpio,"Some people crave comfort more than others, and now that luxe Venus is in your house of domesticity and emotional contentment, you’ll be looking for serenity! But in order to find it, practical matters often need to be addressed. Like: the piles of papers on your desk, the messy closets, family members constantly bickering and your own negative emotions. Next week’s full moon could bring up the latter, so get ready to deal with your demons. However, once exorcised, you can experience more peace.

"
8 december 2016,scorpio,"Maintaining your freedom and individuality within a romantic relationship may be on your mind these days, as erratic Uranus is active in your partnership sector. This is a two-sided coin. On the one hand, you may feel stifled and in need of a lot more space. On the other, you might find that your romance is more exciting if you have the independence to pursue some passion projects of your own. Strike the right balance.

"
9 december 2016,scorpio,"Habits make the man, they say, and they also make the woman! With optimistic Jupiter in the part of your chart that helps you break bad habits (and thought patterns) and replace them with new ones, this is the perfect time to make changes. You’ll be glad you did after the 29th when Uranus goes direct, and your daily grind becomes a heck of a lot busier.

"
10 december 2016,scorpio,"The state of your financial health is paramount these days, as the cosmos will be focusing on money matters. You need to get real about your saving and spending habits due to a stern meeting today between the Sun and Saturn. If you need to develop better habits, the good news is that Saturn is all about discipline and the long term. Next week’s full moon also is in a fiscal part of your chart, helping you develop a stronger bottom line. Examine your budget and expenses now for problem areas that can be fixed.

"
11 december 2016,scorpio,"Let bygones be bygones in your closest relationships, Scorpio. Some battles are simply not worth keeping alive. Better yet, think about the way you communicate with others and ask yourself, honestly, if you should switch up your methods. A helpful Moon aspect will help you repair alliances with the people you love the most.

"
12 december 2016,scorpio,"Planetary influences indicate that you’d like to spend more time with loved ones, not to mention all by yourself. But in order to do that you first need to take care of practical matters, such as household chores and work at the office. Today you might hit upon a smart time and effort-saving idea that will streamline your daily grind. Put it into action now, as tomorrow’s full moon in the most intimate, passionate part of your chart wants you to enjoy more of the sweeter side of life.

"
13 december 2016,scorpio,"Come on baby, light my fire! So sang Jim Morrison, and that’s your theme song for tonight’s full moon in Gemini. This is the lustiest part of your chart so get ready for the passion to flow. But it won’t just be about a hot night in the boudoir–this lunation indicates that decisions will be made, such as getting engaged or deciding to move things up a notch. Singles may decide that they’re done  with being alone, and unhappily attached Scorpios may move on. With dynamic Mars heading into your romance sector next week, this should be one memorable holiday season.

"
14 december 2016,scorpio,"Your financial future is heating up, thanks to yesterday’s full moon in your house of fiscal responsibility. But keep your cards close to your vest, as my Grandma used to say, because you run the risk of giving away information that you shouldn’t. Like: a job hunt you’ve just started, a potential joint venture, trying to close that big client or pursuing your ex for past child support. With Mercury about to go retrograde (in your communication sector, no less) it’s imperative to say as little as possible.

"
15 december 2016,scorpio,"Biting your tongue is going to become your specialty over the next few weeks, courtesy of Mercury retrograding next Monday. But you still have to be careful today, as a tense four-way square in the heavens indicates that a co-worker or client could act out. Expressing your opinion will only make matters worse, as the other party may misconstrue your words and intention. This passes quickly though, and Friday is actually a good time to communicate with these folks.

"
17 december 2017,scorpio,"Give it a rest, Scorpio! You may be tempted to spend the weekend working, but the planets indicate that you should really take it easy. Besides, with energetic Mars entering your house of fun and romance on Monday for the first time in two years, you should be creating a bucket list of the exciting adventures you’d like to have in 2017. The chores can wait.

"
17 december 2016,scorpio,"With the Moon in creative Leo you may dive into work projects with a renewed sense of vigor and passion! The upside to this is that you may discover a smarter, more efficient way of getting things done. With structured Saturn in your house of solid habits and routines, you can make enormous headway if you pay attention to the methods you use to get things done. You have plenty of skills—learn how to use them the right way.

"
18 december 2016,scorpio,"Resist the urge to bail people out of their difficulties. While your heart may be in the right place, your friends and loved ones sometimes need to figure out their own path in life. Your attempts to help may even be taken the wrong way, especially after Mercury goes retrograde tomorrow until early January.

"
19 december 2016,scorpio,"Discretion is the greater part of valor, a saying that you will need to repeat to yourself over and over again in the weeks ahead. That’s because Mercury retrogrades today in your house of communication (ouch!). If you think it, do you need to say it? Is is necessary to vent loudly on social media or via text and e-mail? Be careful with self expression, especially in romance. Aggressive Mars has just entered your house of love, stirring the pot.

"
20 december 2016,scorpio,"Of all the signs you will definitely be the social butterfly of the holiday season! When the Sun enters Capricorn tomorrow, the spotlight will be on you and the people in your circle, not to mention the folks you haven’t met yet. If you’re in the market for new love, start working those social connections! Believe it or not, the “slow” week after Christmas is a wonderful time to network and mingle. Don’t sit at home and binge watch Netflix.

"
21 december 2016,scorpio,"If you don’t ask, you don’t get. It’s a pretty simple statement but a powerful one. Suffering in silence, being shy or expecting others to magically know what you want is not the way to go right now. With the Sun entering the most verbal part of your chart, you should be straight forward about your needs and opinions. Just be diplomatic, please, as Mercury is retrograde here. There’s no need to beat people over the head.

"
22 december 2016,scorpio,"It’s time to get real. Kidding yourself about a person or set of circumstances isn’t going to cut it, not with a Jupiter-Uranus opposition building in the heavens. The good news is that optimistic Jupiter is in one of the most cleansing and healing parts of your chart, so if you need a wakeup call it should come easily and without a lot of drama. Change doesn’t have to be a full-fledged revolution; sometimes just gliding into it does the trick.

"
23 december 2016,scorpio,"Hurry…find some mistletoe! A romantic Moon-Mars aspect brings out the lover in you. Even if you’re single and there are no prospects on the horizon, that can change in the near future. Every day next week from the 26th through New Year’s Day there are super aspects for finding love and sharing romantic moments with an existing amour.

"
24 december 2016,scorpio,"How do you stand out in a crowd? That’s today’s question with a stimulating Saturn-Uranus aspect. The manner in which you present yourself will become all important in the weeks ahead. Take a practical approach to this issue; it’s not necessary to go glam or get involved with gurus. Be yourself, and dazzle.

"
25 december 2016,scorpio,"Of all the signs of the zodiac, your happiness at home is highlighted more than others. Abundant Venus forms three lovely aspects today with other planets, creating a passionate, fun environment. It also appears that more money may be coming your way as stable Saturn in your income house is in a good spot. When Uranus goes direct on the 29th, you’ll be able to say “Show me the money!” with ease.

"
26 december 2016,scorpio,"You might be at the receiving end of a wakeup call today telling you to get your act together. It may sound very Zen-like to say that you’re taking each day as it comes, going with the flow, not letting anything interfere with the movement of your chi– but are you really just flying by the seat of your pants? If you need to become more organized, do so. When you think about it, maintaining a sense of order is essential to most spiritual practices. How many sloppy monasteries or churches do you see?

"
27 december 2016,scorpio,"Should you open up to someone close? With the Sun in your chatty third house, you may feel as though your life should be an open book for anyone to read. But is that wise? Especially in romance, you need to choose what you say to someone close. This isn’t deception; it’s smart strategizing.

"
28 december 2016,scorpio,"Take a far more creative approach to whatever you’re working on, Scorpio. Whether you’re blogging, redecorating your home, choosing a new hairstyle, planning a vacation or working on a client presentation, ask yourself how you could do things differently. Meaning: more eye catching, adventurous, fun, or influential. With tomorrow’s new moon in your house of self expression, you want to go loud and proud, but it certainly doesn’t hurt to shake things up a little.

"
29 december 2016,scorpio,"Got an idea that’s been rolling around in that brain of yours, just dying to get implemented? Now’s the time, Scorpio! The new moon today in Capricorn lets you take your thoughts and make them real. This lunation occurs in your house of self-expression, so pen that novel, code that app, start the blog, paint the picture, design the fashions. With erratic Uranus finally going direct in your house of planning you’ll be able to lay out the necessary steps to take your dreams to a successful conclusion.

"
30 december 2016,scorpio,"They say that flattery will get you everywhere and maybe they’re right! In any case you certainly have the gift of gab today, so use it to your advantage. Not that you should be spewing BS, mind you, but some sincere words of praise from you could go a long way toward making someone else’s day.

"
31 december 2016,scorpio,"Say what you mean what you say. It pays to be as direct as possible with the people around you, both at work and at home, especially if you intend to get anything done. Otherwise you’ll be left holding the bag–and who needs that?

"
1 january 2017,sagittarius,"Some people are hankering for more money in 2017. Others want to get in shape or find a new job. But for you, Sagittarius, it’s all about finding peace of mind and contentment this year. You can’t put a price on it. Even trickier, it comes from within. But Mars and Neptune meet up in the heavens today, motivating and inspiring you to dig down into that inner wellspring of serenity.

"
2 january 2017,sagittarius,"If you’re feeling more emotional and nostalgic recently, it’s not just due to the holidays. A bevy of planets in the sectors that govern love, family and home are creating the desire to feel more grounded. This could intensify today as the Moon connects with Mars and Uranus. This Saturday is an excellent time to figure out what it’s going to take–then take action.

"
3 january 2017,sagittarius,"Romantic relationships may take a far more serious turn over the next four weeks now that Venus is in your house of comfort, security and domestic matters. The “just dating” crowd may decide to move in together or announce an engagement; more established couples could be planning their next pregnancy or the purchase of a home. Singles, you’re not left out of this discussion. Chances are high you’ll be looking for a partner with serious potential, so get moving.

"
4 january 2017,sagittarius,"Unsure about what you’d like to see happen in 2017? If that’s the case, clarity can be achieved over the next week as Mercury retrogrades into your first house of setting goals and self-image. Even if you thought  you knew, go back and revisit your plans! This coming Saturday, the two most authoritative orbs in the solar system, Pluto and the Sun, meet up in your income sector. A major breakthrough could occur, so make sure that you’re ready with a smart elevator pitch, a polished resume or CV, and a strategic marketing plan for 2017.

"
5 january 2017,sagittarius,"The planets are pushing you in so many directions these days, you may not know where to start. Making more money, settling housing issues, handling your kids (not to mention your love life)—all of these are in the cosmos’s crosshairs this week. Why not make life simpler and just for today, focus on matters of the heart. With the emotional Moon swinging past changeable Uranus, it’s time to rewrite your relationship. No lover in sight? That could change pretty soon, especially after the 28th of this month. Then when the weekend arrives, switch your gaze to your career as the Sun meets up with powerful Pluto in your income sector.

"
6 january 2017,sagittarius,"Being happy in love is going to become a driving force for you, archer, and you may feel that strongly today. Next week’s full moon on the 12th is all about passion, lust, intimacy and finding a soulmate. So if your current relationship is about as exciting as watching Seinfeld reruns, you’re either going to have to spice it up or make other plans. When Mercury resumes direct motion on Sunday, the path ahead will become clearer.

"
7 january 2017,sagittarius,"Cha-ching! Everyone loves that sound but it’s going to be much louder for your sign than the other eleven, archer. That’s because take-charge Pluto and the Sun meet up today in your income sector, the place where you can land a new job, earn more, create a solid budget and develop better work habits. Interestingly this is also the house of self-esteem, not surprising really when you consider that our esteem often rises and falls with our savings account balance. It’s an excellent time to focus on the path ahead, to negotiate prosperous deals and to cut the fluff.

"
8 january 2017,sagittarius,"Woo-hoo! Mercury goes direct in your sign, helping clear some of the cobwebs from your brain and roadblocks from your path. Start getting your act together quickly as the messenger planet won’t be here much longer. On Thursday it moves into your income sector, a great time to score a higher paying gig and bank more cash.

"
9 january 2017,sagittarius,"Emotions could be bubbling up all over the place, which includes yours and the people closest to you! This will be a big week for matters of the heart with a full moon on Thursday in your passionate house of intimacy and soulful exchanges. Truth be told, the next few days could be bumpy as you try to figure out what’s going on in other peoples’ minds, as well as trying to understand their agendas and values. Keep your temper in check and wait to get the full picture.

"
10 january 2017,sagittarius,"Someone might throw you a curve ball today or tomorrow, and it could undermine your self confidence. This could be at the office or within a personal relationship and the problem is that it could stall the progress of a project or situation that needs to move forward. This energy carries forward into next week, so be mindful of people in your circle who don’t seem to be team players.

"
11 january 2017,sagittarius,"Money talks, Sagittarius, and today it wants to hold a convo with you—about earning more! You’re in a good place to do so, thanks to the brilliant Sun and transformative Pluto blazing a path through your income sector. Just don’t be too overoptimistic, a potential situation with happy-go-lucky Jupiter in Lala Land today. Your big plans will cost money and will take a lot of time and effort to achieve—don’t lose sight of that.

"
12 january 2017,sagittarius,"Break out the brandy or the Xanax—you’re going to need it! A full moon in your passionate eighth house is going to stir up emotions, not only yours but those of people around you. Erratic Uranus is acting up in the sector that governs lovers and kids, while usually happy Jupiter is in a funk in your friendship sector. So even if you’re as cool as a cucumber, the people closest to you may not be. That being said, this lunation could still be a positive one, as singles might meet a soulmate and attached archers could enjoy even more intimacy with their amour. Mercury has just entered your house of security and guarantees, so you can actually strengthen a relationship after the drama dies down!

"
13 january 2017,sagittarius,"This is no time for playing passive-aggressive games or being a mystery. The cosmos urges you to speak your piece, especially with yesterday’s full moon in the most passionate part of your chart. You actually run the risk of being too emotional, but that’s better than keeping everything locked up inside. Don’t be afraid to lay your cards down on the table. People need to know what you’re thinking.

"
14 january 2017,sagittarius,"If you’ve been holding anything inside, the next four weeks will enable you to get it out there to the right people. The recent full moon fell in your cathartic eighth house, the place where we do inner work by cleansing our psyches of past dramas. Then next Thursday the Sun enters your communicating sector, perfect for holding convos with your tribe. But it also rocks for self-promotion, writing, blogging, teaching and the graphic arts, so if there’s a message you want to deliver, get it ready now.

"
15 january 2017,sagittarius,"This is no time to give in to demands or guilt trips from a lover or family member, or anyone else for that matter. Someone may be trying to push your buttons, but erupting in anger is not the way to go. Stay cool and in control. This energy will be in play for most of the week and may peak on Thursday, so be on your guard.
 
 

"
16 january 2017,sagittarius,"Holding your tongue? You may feel as though you’re biting it these days, afraid to speak your piece at work or with your loved ones. While diplomacy is a valued skill, stuffing your emotions down can result in a volcanic eruption down the road (like this Thursday!). Try to voice your opinions before then, carefully if you must.

"
17 january 2017,sagittarius,"You should start feeling more optimistic about future events as lucky Jupiter sparkles in the sector that governs your closely held wishes. Family matters can especially improve, but that won’t happen by itself–you’ll need to put in some effort. Don’t expect overnight results, as loved ones and real estate issues can take another few weeks to gel. But you have to start somewhere.

"
18 january 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in an emotional place with moody Mars moving through your house of comfort and security. And it’s possible that you’re looking at your friends, drawing comparisons to them and their lifestyle. Is the grass really greener on their side? Perhaps not, something that you may come to realize today. Just remember that your aspirations should be based solely on your authentic self. Life is not a competition.

"
19 january 2017,sagittarius,"Oy vey. The two most stubborn planets in the solar system are at odds today, archer, and of all the signs you may need to chill the most. That’s because serious Saturn is in your sign, facing off against way too emotional Mars. You run the risk of blasting people into the stratosphere with your words and pent up emotions otherwise. If you have something to say, wait until the new moon on the 27th when the aspects are somewhat better for speaking your piece.

"
20 january 2017,sagittarius,"You’ve been up against some tense angles lately, archer, as people around you seem to be intent on pushing your buttons. They may have resorted to guilt, sulking or outright anger, but now you’re in the driver’s seat. That’s because the Sun just entered your communication zone, a helpful aspect that will allow you to get your point across. Put these folks in their place and move on, because it’s time to get some new projects off the ground, especially at the time of the new moon on the 27th.

"
21 january 2017,sagittarius,"Daddy issues, childhood traumas, sibling rivalries begone! We’re all affected by past family dramas, some of us more than others. And if you’re ready to let them go the cosmos is wiling to help. A helpful Moon-Chiron trine will enable youth get to the root of past problems so that you can move on with far less baggage.

"
22 january 2017,sagittarius,"Are you considering launching an exciting new project? Then this is the time to get started, as Friday’s new moon is the perfect moment to initiate it. Today you should be focusing on the resources you’ll need to get things done–the people, funds, habits and routines, and anything else that is necessary for success. Whether it’s a group activity like creating a neighborhood garden or a personal one, such as writing a book, get going.

"
23 january 2017,sagittarius,"Sensitive much? You might feel that way today as Neptune raises questions about certain ties or circumstances in your life. Serious Saturn is pushing you into making some big decisions, but with the Moon close by your emotions could be getting the best of you. Tomorrow is a far better time for having discussions and considering options that will make you feel a lot more settled.

"
24 january 2017,sagittarius,"Sports psychologists and coaches who work with Olympians and other top athletes know that habits can make or break them. Often it’s the ability to stick to a routine, and not talent, that they say creates a champion. Well, archer, the planets are telling you to develop better habits and routines both at home and the office. It appears that you have some readjustments to make. Try to get them done before Friday’s new moon, when your mind will turn to romance and having fun!

"
25 january 2017,sagittarius,"It’s always better to be an efficient, capable person than a listless slacker, but the danger is that you can take on too much responsibility. A powerful Moon-Pluto-Mercury meet up today could be the bucket of cold water dumped on your head that lets you know that you’re overextended. The good thing about this aspect is that it can help you develop better habits and routines. However, the cosmos is also telling you to share your tasks with your family, roommates, and co-workers. It won’t kill them to lift a finger.

"
26 january 2017,sagittarius,"You seem to be in an uncertain place, not knowing if plans of yours are going to work out. There’s a sense of doubt in the air. Do you have the chops to pull something off? Are other people going to cooperate with you? Why are people acting the way they do? The bottom line is that a Venus-Saturn square is shaking your confidence, and it appears that you’re being more pessimistic than is necessary. With abundant Jupiter occupying your house of dreams and wishes, you’re actually in a good spot to witness success and forward movement.

"
27 january 2017,sagittarius,"Got a bright idea that you’d like to pursue? Then there’s no better time than the present, as today’s new moon falls in your house of kick starting projects. Over the next six months you can make amazing headway, whether you’re writing a book, going back to school, developing your portfolio, forming a neighborhood organization or starting a business. Your self-confidence seems to be a bit low at the moment, but this soon passes. Finding a mentor, friend or savvy expert who can help you is advised with a smart Saturn-Jupiter aspect. Set up good habits and systems and you’re ready to rock and roll.

"
28 january 2017,sagittarius,"Put on your dancing shoes! Yesterday’s new moon occurred in your house of socializing and today Mars prances into your sector of romance and having fun. If there’s any sign of the zodiac that should be cutting loose over the next few weeks it’s you, Sagittarius. The only thing that you have to watch for is having too much fun, which might lead to melodrama among your friends and lover(s)—notice that I used the plural form. You won’t be slacking off when it comes to errands and work, though, as Mercury and Pluto in your house of routines and financial security are demanding that some  work gets done.

"
29 january 2017,sagittarius,"Despite the fact that Friday’s new moon fell in your house of socializing, and that yesterday Mars entered your sector of romancing and having fun, the cosmos isn’t going to let you off the hook completely. A stern Pluto-Mercury meeting today demands that you polish up your habits and rituals so that your life runs as smoothly as a Swiss watch. There is a strong financial vibe here. Want to earn more? You can do that and enjoy life at the same time. Just develop the systems you need to take care of business.

"
30 january 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in quite the security conscious mood and today’s Moon-Neptune connection asks that you find serenity. Peace of mind is a form of security, as you aren’t easily rattled by shifting and sometimes disquieting circumstances. There is a quiet strength to serene people. It’s a state that can be achieved if you’re willing to work on it.

"
31 january 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in an excellent spot to earn more money as several celestial orbs are firing up your sectors of thinking and self-expression. This is more about you  coming up with a bright idea, rather than a head hunter calling with a job offer. However, you might feel stymied today, as though the “idea faucet” has been turned off—but this is a temporary blip. Keep at it as the cosmos will be sending some interesting information your way.

"
1 february 2017,sagittarius,"Who’s got your back? That’s a question you’ll be asking yourself between the 6th and early June as Jupiter goes retrograde in your house of friends and contacts. Today a tense face-off between the Moon and Jupiter may cause you to pull away from people as you just don’t want to get sucked into their dramas, nor do you want them stirring stuff up in your life. Protect your space.

"
3 february 2017,sagittarius,"Even the most skilled surgeons, airline pilots and musicians make an effort to improve their capabilities through mentors, practice runs and talent-sharpening workshops. You don’t stop learning till you die, as the saying goes, and with Venus now in your house of talent you should make an effort to be the best you can be: the best mom or dad, teacher, student, employee or boss. The best part? Venus will make it easy.

"
4 february 2017,sagittarius,"Over the next few weeks you may find that you’re more interested in working alone than with a group. Either that, or you’re going to become choosier as to whom you team up with. Two transformative planets, Pluto and Mercury, are in your house of rituals, routines and responsibility. If someone in your circle isn’t pulling their weight you might decide to break from the group or set them straight.

"
5 february 2017,sagittarius,"Over the next few months you’ll need to take a step back and assess where you stand in some of your closest relationships, both at home, at work and in your friendships. Today a tough Neptune-Moon square indicates that there could be some confusion with a lover or family member, and that you’re unsure as to how to proceed. Wait until Tuesday when chatty Mercury enters your verbal sector to make your points clear.

"
6 february 2017,sagittarius,"If you want to get something done, sometimes it’s better to do it yourself! That may be your opinion over the next few months now that Jupiter is retrograding through your house of teamwork. Expect delays from foot dragging colleagues and indecisive team mates, which could also include friends with whom you’re planning an event. You may have to separate the wheat from the chaff if you sense that a pal or team mate is working against the better of the group—or just your best interests. That being said, chatty Mercury enters your communication sector tomorrow, a positive aspect as it can help you straighten things out before they go off the rails. Tech projects especially need to be buttoned up tight.

"
7 february 2017,sagittarius,"Your word is your bond now that chatty Mercury has entered your communication sector. This is a great time to mingle, chat people up and pick someone’s brain for advice. But you may be better off working solo as group efforts can be frustrating over the next few months. Be careful that you share your loftier ideas only with people who are behind you 100%.

"
9 february 2017,sagittarius,"Flirt, sext, wink,  and talk some sweet talk. And while you’re at it, why don’t you call in sick for a play date with a lover? Even if you’re single, today and tomorrow are perfect for some self indulgence. Spontaneity rules, so while you’re out and about you might bump into someone who could be a keeper.

"
10 february 2017,sagittarius,"Sometimes the planets all align in such a manner that you just can’t lose, and that’s what is happening for you today, archer! A spectacular Leo lunar eclipse in the most visionary part of your chart sets the stage for some of your grandest plans to take flight. This is just the beginning of a series of eclipses in Leo that will continue into 2019, with each one pushing you closer and closer to reaching success. The key is to think out of the box, and with super spontaneous Uranus, planet of genius, in a good angle you should have no shortage of creative ideas. Working well with others is also going to be a big part of your journey, so don’t try to go lone wolf.

"
11 february 2017,sagittarius,"It’s time to crowd source, archer. A magnificent Sun-Jupiter trine sets the stage for collaborations or team activities to take off like a rocket. Jupiter is retrograde, which means that you have to be choosy when taking on a partner or asking someone to join the group. But the people who surround you now can help take your ideas to a much higher level.

"
12 february 2017,sagittarius,"Strong arming people in your circle to do or see things your way could backfire, Sagittarius. The problem is that they may be talking in circles or not acting in ways that are acceptable, and your initial response may be to take charge and fire back. Let it slide. By Tuesday things improve, and a strong Saturn-Sun aspect helps you speak with clarity and conviction.

"
13 february 2017,sagittarius,"Speak up for yourself! It’s time to step up and let other people know how you feel. Over the next ten days your ability to dazzle, flirt, emote and just plain old socialize skyrockets. Today you may not want to come on too strong due to a Moon-Sun aspect, but tomorrow works for being straightforward.

"
14 february 2017,sagittarius,"This is no Valentine’s Day to sit in front of the TV with a pizza, archer. Mars and Venus are in the most frisky, romantic house of them all, and the Moon is in the house of celebrating. All Sagittarians should be out on the town tonight regardless of romantic status. Singles, your best place to meet someone is right in town rather than online, so put on your red dress and head for the door.

"
15 february 2017,sagittarius,"Life shouldn’t be all about work, something that you’ll be reminded of today. With energetic Mars striding through your house of creativity, it’s time to plunge into passion projects that mean a lot to you. But you might want to take a fresh look at them for an update. And you also might be better off diving into them solo rather than waiting for other people to come round and join you.

"
16 february 2017,sagittarius,"Hope you’re getting enough sleep. Effervescent Mercury in your house of networking is in full social butterfly mode and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. Take this energy and run with it, as the people you meet in the days ahead could stand the test of time.

"
17 february 2017,sagittarius,"What you think and what you say should be two separate things, today, archer! The problem is that your intuition might be off, causing you to make statements that are based on mixed-up notions rather than cold, hard facts. Likewise, if you’re at the receiving end of a secret—or you have one of your own—keep it under wraps, unless you want to deal with the fallout later on.

"
18 february 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in a terrific spot to talk things over with loved ones, friends and colleagues over the next few weeks, developing a stronger sense of security in the process. The Sun is now in your house of emotional grounding where it will remain for the next month. Don’t hold back your feelings: let them out, especially after the 25th when chatty Mercury joins the Sun in this sector.

"
19 february 2017,sagittarius,"Getting through to people and understanding what makes them tick should be far easier in the days ahead. Today and tomorrow are excellent for communicating with kids and lovers, and Tuesday works for smoothing things over with friends and colleagues. Don’t forget that your voice needs to be heard too.

"
20 february 2017,sagittarius,"Can you get away for a three-day weekend with a lover or some friends? The planets are in a spontaneous mood today, suggesting that you treat yourself to a little holiday. Even if you travel solo it will do wonders for recharging your batteries. Not only that, your creativity will rise and a sense of emotional release will ensue. You need to take a break, archer!

"
21 february 2017,sagittarius,"A glittering trine in your people-centric house of warmth and camaraderie could bring some happy news, Sagittarius. It’s also a good day to make plans with friends, get your ideas across to a group, or showcase your brand on the Internet. This is no time for being shy. Show the world what you’ve got!

"
22 february 2017,sagittarius,"It’s time to put on your big boy pants and get out of the sand box, Sagittarius. If you don’t, you could get pulled into infantile hissy fits that are being pitched by others around you. The two most obstinate planets, Mars and Pluto, are at odds today, leading to drama, head games and power plays. You may feel as though your security is being threatened, but it’s not.

"
23 february 2017,sagittarius,"You mean business, archer, and today’s a good day to express your thoughts. Whether you’re disciplining a child or employee, indulging in sweet talk with a lover or making a big-bucks presentation to a client, your words carry weight. And so they should. With logical Saturn at your side, you have wisdom working for you.

"
24 february 2017,sagittarius,"The upcoming eclipse will remind you that having a happy life at home is of utmost importance. The sense of security and comfort you get there carries over into other areas of your life. Today a lunar aspect opens up the lines of communication with a lover and children, so don’t hold back. Show them how much you care.

"
25 february 2017,sagittarius,"Facing up to issues that have troubled you in the past should become easier now that Mercury is in Pisces. This is especially true of dramas that got their start with family ties or old romantic relationships that went sour. A solar eclipse tomorrow in the same part of the sky could be the final push you need to release them once and for all.

"
26 february 2017,sagittarius,"Don’t be in such a rush to cement a bond that you overlook potential problems, Sagittarius. A solar eclipse in the sector that deals with warm and fuzzy feelings of nesting and closeness could make you too anxious. That being said, if you take your time allow things to gel, the next six months could be a highly rewarding time in which you can experience rich affection for someone–and that includes someone new.

"
27 february 2017,sagittarius,"There’s a lot more to romance than a physical attraction, something that you’d be wise to remember today. The two most hot-blooded planets, Mars and Uranus, meet up in your frisky house of amour, which could lead to a steamy boudoir session. Which is fine…unless you just met the person yesterday and you’re looking for a spouse, or an existing relationship is a mess but the sex is good. Drama and fighting could also erupt, so don’t say or do anything you may regret.

"
28 february 2017,sagittarius,"Habits and routines have a useful purpose, something that you should be paying more attention to. A sweet balance needs to be struck between finding enough time for play and pleasure, and also getting the mundane tasks done. The recent solar eclipse in your house of contentment tells you that if you want “mind like water” you need to remove the stress of undone chores.

"
1 march 2017,sagittarius,"The Chinese culture is known for honoring its ancestors. One of the things they do is to create a little shrine at home in memory of their loved ones. Why not do the same? A meet-up of sentimental Neptune and the Sun in the most nostalgic part of your chart encourages you to pay homage to the people who trod this Earth before you. Look back with fondness and look forward with peace in your heart.

"
2 march 2017,sagittarius,"Stepping away from a person may be the smartest thing you can do today, archer. A tough opposition between Jupiter and Uranus, the first of its kind in 14 years, could stir up way too much drama in their life, which could spill over into yours. This doesn’t mean cutting ties; instead, a little “time out” may be just what the doctor ordered. There’s a reason why people are called “energy vampires”. Make sure that no one is sucking the life force out of you, even if it’s someone you love dearly.

"
3 march 2017,sagittarius,"Too busy to spend quality time with your kids or lover? Uh…you’ll certainly hear about it when Venus starts a four-week retrograde on Saturday. Why not cut them off at the pass? A helpful Moon-Pluto aspect today is perfect for creating new routines that will free up more precious hours. Do it now or face the music!

"
4 march 2017,sagittarius,"Don’t like drama? Then avoid it like the plague between now and April 2nd. Venus retrogrades in your fifth house and theatrics could start to interrupt your life. This is especially true in romantic relationships or with kids. While you can’t control what other people will do, you can  control your own actions. Make sure that you’re not bringing unnecessary conflict into your day.

"
5 march 2017,sagittarius,"Love planet Venus just retrograded in your romance sector, and if you’ve had on rose-colored glasses about an alliance, they’ll be stripped right off today. Mature, stable Saturn is on the case, telling you to get real about the state of your union. Singles, you could have a wakeup call about the kind of person you really need in your life.

"
6 march 2017,sagittarius,"Need to straighten out a family matter? This is one of the best weeks in ages to do so. Today a super Mercury-Sun aspect helps you get to the bottom of issues and take an authoritative stance–without drama and threats. From your chart it looks like people under your roof (or extended family members) may need to take on more personal responsibility. Set boundaries and let them know what you expect.

"
7 march 2017,sagittarius,"Something might happen today that will rattle your sense of security, but it’s a temporary blip. Your outlook for living a more secure, comfortable life is indeed excellent—in money, career, love and family. Once Mars moves into Taurus on Thursday you’ll start to feel more pulled together.

"
8 march 2017,sagittarius,"The cosmos is suggesting that you save or invest more money into real estate, archer. If you don’t own a place, set up a savings account solely for down payment cash—then vow to put something in there every week, no matter how small an amount. If you already own, then consider paying down your mortgage more quickly or refinancing to get a better rate. Maybe you need to splurge on some new furniture or linens so that you can really enjoy your living space. Do whatever it takes!

"
9 march 2017,sagittarius,"Your motivation level will skyrocket in the near future, thanks to aggressive Mars entering your efficiency sector today. Slackers, red tape and obstacles could get annoying pretty quickly under this aspect so keep your cool. If you’re ready to move on with your career or another important goal, Sunday’s full moon could be a turning point when you decide to walk away from the past.

"
10 march 2017,sagittarius,"It’s time to take a 48-hour break from worrying about your career and family members, archer. With the Moon in fun, frisky Leo, chill out with your friends, lover or even a good book tonight and tomorrow. Once the full moon occurs on Sunday in your ambitious tenth house, you’ll be putting the pedal to the metal. Rest up while you can.

"
11 march 2017,sagittarius,"What really floats your boat, archer? Tomorrow’s full moon in Virgo falls in your house of ambition and goals. A Sun-Jupiter aspect today may find you questioning what would make you happiest when it comes to your career and other desires. You may decide to toss out or revise goals that previously were all-important. You’ve changed, and your new plans should reflect that.

"
12 march 2017,sagittarius,"What really floats your boat, archer? Today’s full moon in Virgo falls in your house of ambition and goals. A Sun-Jupiter aspect today may find you questioning what would make you happiest when it comes to your career and other desires. You may decide to toss out or revise goals that previously were all-important. You’ve changed, and your new plans should reflect that.

"
13 march 2017,sagittarius,"This is  no time to hold back in love! You could be feeling strong, sexy and in control thanks to the full moon on Sunday in your house of self esteem and clout. And today sociable Mercury zips into your romance sector, helping you flirt like nobody’s business. Watch out for stirring things up too much, though, as jealousy or resentment could percolate.

"
14 march 2017,sagittarius,"We all know that group activities can be fraught with stress, as some people don’t pull their weight or can’t agree on a direction. Someone may act out today in a team environment, but don’t let this throw you off your game. You’re on the right track. You may hold back from responding this week, but once the 20th arrives you can move forward with your creative vision.

"
15 march 2017,sagittarius,"Someone could come into your orbit over the next day or two who could end up being a wonderful new friend, mentor or business contact. Sometimes the universe delivers the right people to us at just the right time. Keep an open mind and get ready to socialize.

"
16 march 2017,sagittarius,"Your intuition will be able to help you in coming up with a solution to a problem, especially one that deals with your family or your personal emotional state. Truth be told, there are some difficult aspects in the heavens that could be stirring up your feelings. Don’t let other people push your buttons to the point where you have no say-so in important matters.

"
17 march 2017,sagittarius,"Major life changes can happen when Saturn is in your sign, which has been the case over the past two years. You’re changing as a person, figuring out what works and what doesn’t. As a result you may have made some major decisions about where you live, your relationships with family members and where you’re headed in your love life. But you could be facing resistance from loved ones who feel threatened by your new attitude, something that may become apparent today.

"
18 march 2017,sagittarius,"Talk flirty to me! A super sweet meet up of Venus and Mercury sets the stage for socializing, winking and love talk. It’s also a terrific weekend for artistic types to display their talents. Think that you’re not creative? Please. We all have hobbies that we like to indulge in. Spend some time unwinding with the activities that you enjoy best.

"
19 march 2017,sagittarius,"With the Sun about to enter one of the most enjoyable parts of your chart, you could be feeling ready for romance, socializing and having fun in your free time. Nothing wrong with that! But stern Saturn warns you today to get real–about your emotions, the people in your circle, your values and your dreams. Otherwise you may spend the next four weeks chasing down things that aren’t a reflection of the real you.

"
20 march 2017,sagittarius,"Romantic reboot! The fiery Sun is now in Aries, your house of amour and enjoying the finer things in life. This is a terrific aspect for finding new love, growing a romance or even conceiving a baby. Our skills and talents are also found in this sector, so if you need to polish yours up why not sign up for a class or a seminar? Get back into hobbies and sports that you used to enjoy. Life’s too short to be working all the time.

"
21 march 2017,sagittarius,"Optimistic Jupiter has been stirring you to do things that go beyond your personal needs, such as giving back with volunteer work. Yes, one person can change the world (Gandhi, for instance) but progress can get held up by opposing forces. Don’t let this stop you. Whatever your personal passion may be, pursue it—and go under, around or over obstacles.

"
22 march 2017,sagittarius,"Your talents could be in demand over the next few weeks, so get ready to show them off. But whatever you do, don’t sell them to the lowest bidder! If someone tries to hire you on the cheap tell them politely that you’re worth more. The same holds true for love, Sagittarius. Dignity comes from recognizing your own value as a human being.

"
23 march 2017,sagittarius,"Pluto’s job is to point out the weaknesses in situations, whether it’s your finances, emotions or romance, just to name a few. And today this little tough guy could hand you a reality check about all three. As a result you may feel insecure about where your life is heading and try to demand answers from people around you. Bad move! Wait until Saturday, as a tense T-square in the heavens today and tomorrow could lead to arguments and hurt feelings.

24 march 2017,sagittarius,"You may be feeling passionate about a person, a cause or a plan, but despite your positive energy you could face setbacks today. Usually-optimistic Jupiter is in a tough spot, suggesting that others may not support your plans, or that you need to reconsider some aspects of them. Not to worry, however. Your creative mojo rises tomorrow with a strong Sun-Venus aspect and gets even better at the time of Tuesday’s new moon.

"
25 march 2017,sagittarius,"The past few days may have bumpy, with friends and lovers acting out. However, a nice and easy meeting of the Sun and Venus in your house of romance and fun can smooth things over. If you’re interested in meeting someone new, doors will start to open over the next few weeks. Attached archers should start to carve out more quality time for their loved ones, which also includes kids–who are a part of this sector.

"
26 march 2017,sagittarius,"Attention, archers! Maverick planet Uranus is acting up in your house of romance—and it’s good  trouble that it’s causing. A lover could plan an unexpected but fun date, something that’s a far cry from the usual. Singles could meet someone new in a way that they never dreamed of (laundry room, supermarket, doctor’s office). This energy carries on into the next few weeks, so be prepared.

"
27 march 2017,sagittarius,"Bright ideas? You could be full of them this week, due to the influence of genius Uranus and brainy Mercury. Don’t be concerned about following the crowd and fitting in. If you have something interesting to talk about, get it out there. People may not realize the value of your brainstorms at first but they eventually will.

"
28 march 2017,sagittarius,"New levels of closeness can be reached with a lover or your kids in the months ahead, archer. You can thank today’s new moon for that! Obviously you’ll have to put in some effort, but between now and September rich affection and playfulness are the name of the game. Single Sagittarians can meet an a amorous new flame, so get out there and start mingling.

"
29 march 2017,sagittarius,"Serious Saturn in your sign will encourage you to let other people know that you mean business, archer! Today the ringed planet forms a fabulous aspect with verbal Mercury, enabling you to talk to a lover or kids with clarity, kindness and firmness. Yesterday’s new moon in the part of your chart that governs loved ones will help you enjoy more quality time with them and strengthen your bond.

"
30 march 2017,sagittarius,"Thanks to the recent new moon in the most creative and fun-loving part of your chart, you may be dying to break away from an old look, attitude, routine or rut. Sticking with the same old-same old may be tempting too, as it’s a comfortable place to be. So what’s an archer to do? Think things over and wait for Mercury to enter Taurus tomorrow. You’ll be in a great spot to strategize and create some new habits.

"
31 march 2017,sagittarius,"Make haste with streamlining procedures, either at home or the office. Efficient little Mercury buzzes into your productivity sector where it will remain in direct motion until April 9th. Knock out errands and empty that to-do list as best you can. The recent new moon in Aries will help you find more creative ways to get things done, by the way, so start thinking about how you approach the daily grind with a fresh set of eyes.

"
1 april 2017,sagittarius,"They say that habits make the man (and the woman), and now’s the time to polish up yours. Mercury enters your house of efficiency today, forcing you to examine just how you go about your day. It will retrograde from the 9th til the 18th in this sector, so don’t be surprised if inefficiencies in your systems and routines smack you right in the face. That’s OK–change them and live a more serene lifestyle.

"
2 april 2017,sagittarius,"Don’t be so emo! That’s what others may tell you, or that’s what you may be telling yourself over the next two weeks. Venus has just gone retrograde in your fourth house, so you may become sensitive and take things too much to heart. Romance may get a little dicey as you overthink matters. This vibe ends on the 15th, at which time sweet clarity will return.

"
3 april 2017,sagittarius,"Matters of the heart could hit a few snags with a Moon-Sun square. You may be looking for answers—hell, demanding  answers—but that doesn’t mean that your partner is willing to open up. This situation could become more intense by the weekend, and by the time of next Tuesday’s full moon you’ll be expecting full disclosure. Love planet Venus finishes its retrograde on the 15th at which time things should start improving.

"
4 april 2017,sagittarius,"A lover might make demands on you today that you’re not ready to agree to. Whether they want an engagement ring, more quality time, greater intimacy, better sex or more open communication, you may resent the request. This will continue into next week, so be on your guard. Likewise it may be you who is demanding answers. The full moon on Tuesday will help you determine if you’re on the same page.

"
5 april 2017,sagittarius,"With emotional Neptune in the most sensitive part of your chart you may be prone to acting on feelings rather than logic. But today the moon advises you to pay attention to the feelings that tell you to break free from old confining roles. Life’s too short to play it safe.

"
6 april 2017,sagittarius,"Mature, stern Saturn has been in your sign for over two years, and as a result major changes may have happened in your life. This is the planet of living successfully for the long term, and today it retrogrades for several months. If any part of your life needs an upgrade, now’s the time to go after it—a fresh self-image, improved health, a career change, new love, moving to another part of the country, or starting a business, just as examples. This may require slowing down, conducting research, learning more and making some tough decisions, but it will be worth it.

"
7 april 2017,sagittarius,"The people you love the most may be battling to spend time with you, archer, something that could start getting on your nerves! While it’s wonderful to have friends, a lover and be involved in community and volunteer activities, you may be spreading yourself too thin. Think about your commitments and ask yourself if you have time for all of them. The full moon next Tuesday will help you make decisions about the company you keep.

"
8 april 2017,sagittarius,"Your security may feel threatened by four planets that are testily glaring at each other across the heavens. Whether it’s financial insecurity or feeling unsettled about a romance, you may feel anxious and concerned. If there’s a silver lining here, it’s that logical Saturn is in your sign, helping you sort out fantasy from reality. Don’t let other people try to call the shots either. It’s your life and you deserve some guarantees.

"
9 april 2017,sagittarius,"Cut the red tape! Now that Mercury is retrograde in your efficiency zone, you may realize that you’re drowning in inefficient habits and routines, not to mention dealing with slackers who create even more work for you. Between now and the 20th vow to get a grip on your everyday chores both at home and at the office. If that means hiring a house cleaner or an assistant at work, do it. But the bottom line is that your personal habits will count more than anything else.

"
10 april 2017,sagittarius,"Your powers of persuasion are strong and you should be networking to the best of your ability. While you can cut business deals or find a new job this way, you can also use the gift of gab for making a difference in the world. Tomorrow’s full moon falls in your house of charitable work, and with your powerful Sagittarian vision you can move mountains.

"
11 april 2017,sagittarius,"Do you need to put some distance between you and acquaintances, or do you need to create closer bonds? That’s the question behind today’s full moon. Separate the true blue pals and colleagues from the pretenders and frenemies. With logical Saturn in a good angle you’ll make the right decision–not to mention forging some new bonds that will last for decades.

"
12 april 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in an excellent spot to understand someone else’s point of view, thanks to a lovely lunar aspect. And you can also understand more of what makes you  tick. Venus has been retrograde for a month in an emotional sector, which may have found you thinking about issues from the past and how to resolve them. The golden planet moves direct on Saturday, clearing confusion and pointing the way ahead.

"
13 april 2017,sagittarius,"Do your homework on a money issue: make sure that you have all the numbers crunched and the facts on your side. You’re in an excellent spot to make financial headway but you  need to be calling the shots. Don’t let anyone rush or strong arm you into making a decision.

"
14 april 2017,sagittarius,"This is not a day to make fast decisions, especially in matters of the heart. Erratic Uranus is stirring the pot, which could create a sudden argument or a heated attraction! Simmer down and wait for Venus to resume direct motion tomorrow. It will put you in a more grounded place where you’ll be more focused on the long term and security.

"
15 april 2017,sagittarius,"Hallelujah–Venus stops retrograding through your fourth house of serenity, comfort and family. Now you can get back on better terms with loved ones, not to mention setting aside some much needed down time for yourself. If you and a lover have been at odds over key issues the confusion should start to dissipate. This is also a great time to relax more at home rather than being out on the town.

"
16 april 2017,sagittarius,"The pace may be picking up both at home and at work, thanks to planets in these sectors being active. But today you can find a happy medium between the two. You should be considering how to spend more down time relaxing with loved ones, not to mention sneaking in some quality time for yourself. When the Sun enters Taurus later this week your workload will increase; balance is necessary.

"
17 april 2017,sagittarius,"Serious talks can take place between you and loved ones, especially children or your amour. It’s time to get problems ironed out and make big plans for the future. With the authoritative Sun and long-term Saturn forming a fabulous angle, this is one of the best times all year to make progress.

"
18 april 2017,sagittarius,"If cash flow problems have you concerned, don’t get emotional about it, a possibility today with the moon in a vulnerable spot. You’ll be able to gain control over matters once Pluto goes retrograde in this part of your chart on Thursday. Pluto is all about owning up to yourself and stepping into a position of control. You’ve got this.

"
19 april 2017,sagittarius,"Beware of burning the candle at both ends, archer. The energetic Sun is now in your house of multi-tasking, which can actually be a good thing as it will motivate you to declutter and get organized both at home and at work. The problem is that Pluto is about to retrograde this Thursday in your income sector, stirring up fears about not having enough cash. You may respond by throwing yourself into a working frenzy, burning out in the process. Maintain a logical attitude about your cash flow.

"
20 april 2017,sagittarius,"Fears of loss may start to crop up now that subterranean Pluto is back stroking through your security sector. This includes your income and career as well as romantic unions, so it’s imperative to not let worries get the best of you between now and late September. The good news is that assertive Mars is about to enter your committed relationship house on Friday, a place it hasn’t been in over two years. If you’re looking to form a more prosperous business alliance or a happier romance you’ll have the opportunity to do so, and get rid of some of those fears in the process.

"
21 april 2017,sagittarius,"Put on your seatbelt, archer, you’re in for a bumpy ride when it comes to romance. Mars enters your house of serious commitment today, which should  be good news for those seeking a new lover, an engagement ring or a deeper level of bonding with their amour. The problem is that Mercury just retrograded yesterday in your romance house, making you question your situation. The next few weeks could be full of drama and misunderstandings. Once May 3rd arrives things should calm down and the future will easier to determine.

"
22 april 2017,sagittarius,"Not ready to settle down? A tense Venus-Saturn square indicates that family or housing issues could get stalled: moving in with your boyfriend, conceiving a baby, relocating to a new place or settling issues with your parents. With Saturn in your sign it appears that you’re the logical one and that others around you are not—unless they’re archers too! Don’t let anyone sweet talk or guilt you into doing something that you don’t think is smart or affordable right now.

"
23 april 2017,sagittarius,"There’s a strong nesting vibe in the air for you today, perfect for lolling at home with your loved ones. If you do go out, head to the store and shop for new duvets, furniture, dishes and tableware. The planet of luxury and beauty, Venus, has set up camp in your domestic fourth house and wants you to create a lush lair. Comfort counts as much as beauty, so create a place that makes you feel content.

"
24 april 2017,sagittarius,"A happy development could arise in your love life as Mercury winks at Saturn. Someone may spill how they truly feel for you; a relationship could move up to the next logical step; or baby talk could ensue. Speaking of kids, this aspect takes place in the part of your chart that deals with them, so there could also be good news concerning one of your kids.

"
25 april 2017,sagittarius,"Amorous Venus will be gliding into your love sector this weekend, so bring on the romance! This will be Venus’s second trip here this year, so if a relationship was strained before it could experience rebirth now. Today spontaneous Uranus is in fine form, encouraging you to do things differently. Maybe you should seek out a new type. Perhaps you need to bring more excitement into an existing relationship by planning more date nights at new venues. Think outside of the box!

"
26 april 2017,sagittarius,"New business opportunities could come your way—which includes a job offer—but you need to take a more creative approach in order to make them happen. Today’s new moon in the work sector of your chart can open doors, and over the next six months you can see big changes. Approach projects from a different viewpoint. Take classes that will help you think more originally.

"
27 april 2017,sagittarius,"Your stress level is definitely connected in part to your habits and routines. Are they serving you or are you a blind slave to them? Power broker Pluto is telling you to gain control over your life by establishing new routines that will smooth the path ahead. This includes your eating patterns and workout schedule (or lack thereof!). Start pulling things together so that you’re in charge.

"
28 april 2017,sagittarius,"Ggrrr! The archer is looking and sounding more like a tiger now that sexpot Venus is in your romance sector. Spontaneous Uranus is also acting out, encouraging you to take a chance of some kind: being more of a flirt, asking someone out, switching up your date night routine or even changing the way you dress. Life is certainly taking a more exciting turn. Make the most of it!

"
29 april 2017,sagittarius,"What you want and what somebody else wants could be two different things this weekend. The question is, how will it play out? Judging from your chart you’re going to stick to your guns. The recent new moon in Taurus is only increasing your practicality and desire to get things done. If others don’t want to play along they could be tossed to the curb pretty quickly!

"
30 april 2017,sagittarius,"It’s a perfect day for some “mental house cleaning”! It’s time to take out the trash, meaning dissatisfaction, stress, fear, jealousy and all the other stinky emotions that clutter up our minds. A super Sun-Moon aspect encourages you to seek healing modalities like meditation, reiki, affirmations and maybe even a detox diet. A shaman or holistic practitioner may be just the person you need right now.

"
1 may 2017,sagittarius,"A sudden independent streak may hit you, especially when it comes to romance. Singles may rebel against getting involved, while attached archers may resist a warm and fuzzy “caring and sharing” session. If anyone tries to play head games with you, using guilt or sex as a weapon, you’re going to set them straight.

"
2 may 2017,sagittarius,"People who may not have supported your ideas or dreams may come around, archer. There’s a cooperative mood in the air as the Moon forms a terrific aspect with Mars. Not only might they believe in your vision, it’s also possible that they might want to join you on your journey. Be discerning and consider whether you want to fly solo or have company.

"
3 may 2017,sagittarius,"Woo-hoo! Mercury goes direct in the house that deals with enjoying life to the fullest. This includes romance, so if your love life has felt like the desert, rather than a lush tropical garden of early delights, things should turn around. It’s also a great time to indulge in your creative talents, hobbies and sports over the next few weeks.

"
4 may 2017,sagittarius,"Love might take an, uh, interesting  turn today. Someone at the office may be crushing on you; or perhaps you’re harboring secret feelings for a co-worker, boss or client! Take it easy there, archer. Even if you’re not being tempted by an office liaison it’s likely that you’re interested in a partner with solid financial backing, someone who has a strong foundation and maturity. And what’s wrong with that?

"
5 may 2017,sagittarius,"Keep an eye on team members as a Jupiter-Sun aspect advises discernment. The roles that people play and the tasks that they’re responsible for may need to be changed. This is true whether you’re planning a wedding, staging a play, launching an entrepreneurial venture or putting together a charitable foundation. Find the right person for the right duties.

"
6 may 2017,sagittarius,"Lusting for the more expensive things—the racy sports car, beachside dream home or designer wardrobe? You could be, with the Moon in the part of your chart that seeks prestige. The problem is that your current circumstances seem to be hemming you in. Not only that, Saturn in your sign may be making you feel as though the only important thing in life is a safe paycheck. Consider your options!

"
7 may 2017,sagittarius,"Need to get something off your chest? Then reach out to a close friend or mentor as they could provide you with just the right words of wisdom today! You probably have a lot on your mind considering that Wednesday’s full moon occurs in your house of closure. Talk to the people who have your best interests at heart.

"
8 may 2017,sagittarius,"A close friend or lover may tell you something that you don’t want to hear, archer. There’s a full moon coming this week in the sector that deals with cutting ties and releasing bad habits and memories. The question is: do you need to separate from some of these people? Or are they tipping you off about changes that you desperately need to make in your own behavior and thought patterns?

"
9 may 2017,sagittarius,"Some sizzling opportunities to earn more money could come your way, Scorpio, so get ready to impress! Have your resume, brag book or portfolio ready. Get caught up on tasks and e-mails. Decision makers have their eyes on you and you want to show them only the very best that you have to offer. Some of these people may be hiding in the wings, so keep that in mind as you go through your day.

"
10 may 2017,sagittarius,"Out with the old…in with the new. It’s obviously not New Year’s Eve but it is  your annual full moon in the house of closure and healing. If there is going to be a time in 2017 when you can turn a new leaf it’s now. Frenemies, bad habits, dead end jobs, carrying a torch for an ex, hurt feelings from past dysfunctional family dramas—kick ‘em to the curb and move on. You may especially be sensitive to matters of the heart as maverick Uranus and intelligent Mercury are deep in conversation in the house of romance. Should you stay or should you go?

"
11 may 2017,sagittarius,"Who’s running the show? If anyone in your life is pushing you around like you’re part of a cattle herd, chances are you’ll lash out today. An overbearing spouse, nosy in-law, demanding parent, pushy lover, or critical business partner could try to exert influence over you. And they’ll regret it too, thanks to an aggressive Mars aspect. It’s also possible that passive-aggressive or guilt tactics may be part of their repertoire, so don’t fall for it. Stand your ground.

"
12 may 2017,sagittarius,"The more the merrier! Abundant Jupiter is in your house of socializing and networking, and promises that you’ll gain more than just having fun from hanging out with other people. The connections you make right now could have a profound effect on your future: you could find a new mate, gain entry into an elite group of investors or brilliant thinkers, make lifelong friends or find the perfect mentor. But it’s up to you to get the ball rolling, so find the perfect place to start schmoozing.

"
13 may 2017,sagittarius,"Every now and then the cosmos tells us to get our lives in order, and that’s the message for you today, archer! From your household chores to your workout routine, you need to become more efficient. Get rid of the piles of paper on your desk, catch up on unfinished projects at work and at home, and let others know that you expect them to do their share. The relief that you feel will be palpable. Talk about instant stress reduction!

"
14 may 2017,sagittarius,"Sometimes the smartest way to get ahead is to sit back and let opportunity come to you. With lucky Jupiter in your house of networking and friends, the people on your contact list are the best source of finding what you’re looking for in life.

"
15 may 2017,sagittarius,"Playing by the rules is important this week, and you should also be working on developing better habits and routines. But the cosmos tells you that the onus is not only on you to get your act together: the people closest to you need to do the same. And you need to diplomatically tell them that. Otherwise when Mercury enters the most efficient part of your chart on Tuesday you’ll end up being overburdened and burnt out.

"
16 may 2017,sagittarius,"Practical details are the order of the day now that capable Mercury is in your house of efficiency. Between now and June 6th you should be focusing on how to get more done in less time, at home as well as work. If that means getting rid of slacker employees or laying down some serious consequences for kids who won’t clean their rooms, so be it. At least you should be able to get a spouse or business partner in line after the Sun changes signs on Saturday!

"
17 may 2017,sagittarius,"Wishful thinking can sometimes take you to the unrealistic land of unicorns and rainbows. However, it can also take you to a place of creation and fulfillment. The great scientists, investors, writers and artists all started out with what people often derided as “wishful thinking”. You’re in a terrific spot to take a dream and run with it, so stop thinking and begin by taking action.

"
18 may 2017,sagittarius,"Slow your roll in matters of the heart, archer. Amorous Venus is in a tough mood today, warning against “pink fluffy clouds” kind of thinking. It’s imperative to know if you and a lover share the same values and long term goals. Singles, don’t be in such a rush to land a lover that you overlook big problems in a potential mate. The greatest source of wisdom these days is you; the opinions of your pals may be way off, so trust your own gut.

"
19 may 2017,sagittarius,"Shake, rattle and roll! Staid Saturn has been plodding through your sign for two years, which is wonderful for developing maturity, thinking logically and creating smart long-term plans. But it can also make your life a little….yawn….too safe. Which is why you should enjoy today’s megawatt Uranus-Saturn trine, in which rebellious Uranus tells you to bust out of that safe little groove you’ve been in. How can you add more creativity and enjoyment to your life? The good news is that this energy will last for the next six months. Fuel your more passionate side.

"
20 may 2017,sagittarius,"Your love life may start taking some interesting twists and turns now that the Sun is in your commitment sector. While you can certainly meet someone new (who is a serious prospect, by the way) or take an existing relationship to the next level, there may some frissons of doubt in your mind. Sober Saturn, that planet of logical thinking and planning long term, will be in a tough angle over the next few weeks. You may question whether you want to stay in a union. Or, you’re not sure if your needs are being met—and an independent streak is starting to develop. The new moon on the 25th will be a turning point, a time to make decisions.

"
21 may 2017,sagittarius,"Feeling frisky and flirty? You should be with the Moon in the most charismatic part of your chart! Turn on the charm over the next few days to land a new lover or to enjoy more romantic times with your current amour. This also happens to be the house of creativity, so let your talents flow. Don’t be surprised if later this week someone has noticed your skills and suggests a deal, job or partnership.

"
22 may 2017,sagittarius,"Crossed wires may be confusing key relationships and it’s up to you to untangle them. Luckily, sweet Venus is in a helpful spot today. You may discover that some of the confusion is coming from you, which means that a little self reflection is in order. Get your head screwed on straight early in the week as the new moon on Thursday highlights alliances.

"
23 may 2017,sagittarius,"With so much current planetary activity in your house of partnering and sharing with others, no one could blame you for trying to be team player (which also includes being part of a romantic relationship). But the cosmos warns that you shouldn’t lose your identity in the process. You have needs and dreams and desires which should be explored. If you neglect this primal need you could end up being resentful and burned out. Balance is the key.

"
24 may 2017,sagittarius,"When it comes to relating to people these days, the cosmos tells you to keep things real and keep them brief. No long winded discussions are necessary, no flattery, no confusing stories, no passive aggressive nonsense. This may not go over well with the people you know but that’s too bad. It’s better for everyone involved if you’re as straightforward as possible.

"
25 may 2017,sagittarius,"It’s time to get serious about your connections with others, whether it’s in business or romance. Commitment is a two-way street and today’s new moon helps you cement bonds. If anyone in your life brings too much drama to the table, is immature or can’t carry out the responsibilities they’re supposed to be handling then you need to set them straight.This may take more than one attempt but it needs to be done.

"
26 may 2017,sagittarius,"Don’t lock yourself in to strict plans this weekend as spontaneous Uranus is looking for a good time. Instead of doing the same-old, same-old this holiday weekend, why not fly by the seat of your pants and do something completely different? Sports, entertainment and travel are all in the stars for your sign so get out there and have a good time.

"
27 may 2017,sagittarius,"People may be sending conflicting messages and you could be at a loss as to how to read them. This will continue into next week, so why bother wasting any time on trying to figure it out right now? A happy Moon-Uranus aspect encourages you to get out there this weekend and have some fun.

"
28 may 2017,sagittarius,"Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home! And this weekend is the perfect time to refresh your living quarters. Sure, cleaning out closets makes you feel more organized, but with inspirational Neptune on the job you should also go shopping for some luxe things for your digs.

"
29 may 2017,sagittarius,"Yowza! Slow down there, archer. Just because hot blooded Mars is tearing through your commitment sector doesn’t mean that (a) you should be picking out wedding dresses for your upcoming nuptials to the guy you met last night; (b) you should break up with someone because they slightly pissed you off; or (c) you should be freaking out about your biological clock. A Mars-Saturn smackdown might encourage you to do something rash, and as we all know rash decisions rarely work out.

"
30 may 2017,sagittarius,"It ain’t easy being sexy and flirtatious, but someone’s gotta do it and it might as well be you! A spontaneous meet up between maverick Uranus and lusty Mars sets the stage for some fun. Grab your honey and have an enjoyable night out on the town. Better yet, call in sick and make it an all-day event.

"
31 may 2017,sagittarius,"Before you dive into a project make sure that you have considered all of the smaller things that need to be done correctly in order to produce a winning outcome. With intelligent Mercury in your meticulous house of efficiency this shouldn’t be a problem. Oh, and you might want to make sure that other people involved know what’e expected of them. Try to maintain the lead in this endeavor.

"
1 june 2017,sagittarius,"If you want it, put a ring on it! Serious Saturn is pushing archers to get real about where a relationship is going. If your union resembles a dog chasing its tail, it may be time to move on. Otherwise it’s a perfect day to discuss what you both want for the future, and that includes those of you already in a marriage. Make sure to schedule more date nights—without the kids!     

"
1 june 2016,sagittarius,"Clouds are forming in the skies, and they cast shadows on your love life–or lack of one! If you have been too busy handling family dramas or chores to put quality time into romance, it will become evident that your needs must be met also. Whether you’re single and caring for an elderly parent, or you’re a stay-at-home mom who can’t keep up with the laundry and the dirty dishes, you’re going to get fed up. When you try to keep everyone else happy, your own contentment may suffer.

"
2 june 2017,sagittarius,"Trying to do everything all by yourself may sound  OK (“if I do it, I know it will be done the right way” or “I don’t feel like dealing with other people and their head trips”). But from your chart it appears that you can get more mileage from collaborating with others than going it alone. Once intelligent Mercury enters your partnership zone next Tuesday you can initiate conversations with movers and shakers.

"
2 june 2016,sagittarius,"What kind of career would make you excited about getting up in the morning? That’s the question today, as a harmonious trine between the Moon and the North Node stirs your curiosity. If you already love what you do, amen. A juicy new assignment could come your way. But if your job is of the soul-sucking (or non-existent!) variety, start thinking of a career that would put a smile on your face.

"
3 june 2017,sagittarius,"Your desire to be involved in more rewarding relationships is on the rise thanks to an energetic meeting of megawatt Uranus and gracious Venus. This holds true for all of your closest connections, from friends and lovers to business alliances. A far more cooperative atmosphere is building in which you can either advance existing unions or create some exciting new ones. If others don’t share your sense of camaraderie, maybe it’s time for some new faces.

"
3 june 2016,sagittarius,"Something’s gotta give, and you’re the one who has to figure out what it is. The demands of your family are starting to catch up with you, along with your job. A Grand Cross in the heavens is pitting your needs against those of the other people around you, and quite frankly, you’re tired of being the go-to girl or guy. It’s time to set boundaries, and with disciplined Saturn in your first house, you will  enforce them and make them stick. The new moon on Sunday falls in your partnership sector, so that’s a good time to demand a fair division of labor and some emotional support.

"
4 june 2017,sagittarius,"Feeling amorous? Lusty Mars charges into your eighth house of libido and intimacy, the place where we share our body and soul with another person. Over the next few weeks you can reboot a relationship that has become somewhat stale or find a new lover, someone with depth. With next week’s full moon occurring in your sign, you’ll definitely be looking out for #1 but this isn’t a problem. You need balance and openness in love, and you should  be demanding it.

"
5 june 2017,sagittarius,"Getting the straight story from people may be impossible today, so don’t waste your time. Unfortunately the perps involved could be people close to you, not just the two-tongued customer service rep at your health insurance company or the DMV. Considering that incendiary Mars just entered one of the most emotional parts of your chart, your best bet is to count to ten and walk away. Don’t worry, you’ll be back on track by Wednesday.

"
6 june 2017,sagittarius,"The couple that plays together stays together? Now that love planet Venus is in your house of fitness and vitality, you and your amour might consider a joint workout. Start running in the morning, take a salsa class together at the gym or sign up for tennis lessons. And what if there is no lover to be found? All the more reason to work out, my friend. Start looking gorgeous for the people you haven’t even met yet, not to mention exacting revenge on an ex.

"
7 june 2017,sagittarius,"You need to develop balance in your life, archer, especially with key relationships. No one should be playing bully or victim. No enabling or being a martyr (and this includes the workplace as much as it does your family). Conversations should be plentiful and frank. The full moon on Friday falls in your sign, so although you’ll be looking out for #1 you also need to consider the needs and plans of others.

"
8 june 2017,sagittarius,"Sometimes we stay in friendships out of habit. We may have changed, and perhaps we’ve outgrown the relationship with another person, but we still stick around. A reflective Jupiter-Neptune aspect today asks you to consider your alliances. If you’re happy with the people in your world, so be it! But frenemies and malcontents will just suck the life out of you. Choose wisely.

"
9 june 2017,sagittarius,"This is one of the most important days of the year for you, Sagittarius! It’s the annual full moon in your sign, which means that you could be wrapping up something of great importance to you. But this lunation is key as serious Saturn is standing nearby. You might make some major decisions within the next few weeks, and whatever you decide to do will have long lasting ramifications. Considering that Saturn is the planet of wisdom and maturity, the changes you make to your life will be based on solid thinking, not the wishful kind.

"
10 june 2017,sagittarius,"It takes two to tango, as the saying goes, and now that Jupiter is moving direct you should be seeing more cooperation with others. The gigantic planet was retrograde in your house of teamwork, friends and networking, not to mention tech ventures. If progress was slow in any of these areas you should now start to see more forward movement. Likewise, if you’ve been operating as a lone ranger, it’s time to start working your connections.

"
11 june 2017,sagittarius,"Focusing on the details just isn’t important over the next few days. As a matter of fact, the only thing you should be thinking about is you. Selfish? Not really. The cosmos is pushing you to focus on your journey ahead, the big picture.

"
12 june 2017,sagittarius,"Leveling with people gets easier today thanks to a helpful Mercury aspect. This is especially true if you need to discuss a long term plan: a romantic commitment perhaps, a business deal,  a contract or your values. Do so today, because the end of the week brings some tough aspects that could make cooperation hard to come by.

"
13 june 2017,sagittarius,"Trying to get a straight answer from someone close may be damn near impossible, so prepare to be patient! Neptune, that watery planet of misinformation, is acting up today. This energy builds as the week goes on, and by Thursday you may be ready to let someone have it. If you need to give someone an ultimatum, so be it. But be prepared to act on it.

"
14 june 2017,sagittarius,"Super day to express not only your thoughts, but your feelings! This is especially true of long term matters of the heart or business. Serious Saturn is in a good spot to help you get your point across. If you need to pull people together to create a productive synergy, do so. You could experience resistance tomorrow, though, so don’t expect instant cooperation.

"
15 june 2017,sagittarius,"No matter how much you may feel like cooperating with others, they may not be in the mood to do the same. So forget the “sharing is caring” business and start looking out for #1. This doesn’t mean that you should be selfish or obnoxious. Instead, merely focus on your own plans, values and dreams. Eventually others will get back on board with you.

"
16 june 2017,sagittarius,"Keep a close eye on home and family related matters until late November, Sagittarius. Confusing Neptune retrogrades in your domestic sector, creating miscommunication and maybe even hurt feelings on your part. Make sure that anyone who works on your home, such as a contractor or housekeeper, knows what their responsibilities are and that their paperwork is in order. You may need to set boundaries with loved ones too, which may not go over well—but so be it.

"
17 june 2017,sagittarius,"Everyone needs a serene place to come home to at night, but archers will be more focused on this than the other signs of the zodiac. That’s because Neptune just began to back stroke through your domestic sector, shining its light on your emotional happiness in addition to the actual warmth, comfort and decor of your abode. If anyone or anything is getting in the way of your sense if peace, it’s time to make some changes.

"
18 june 2017,sagittarius,"Your sign is known for its individualistic streak, but the planets are telling you to be sociable and hang out with others over the next few days. There’s even the chance of some serious partying in your astrological forecast. Serendipity is a part of this, so be open to some interesting surprises!

"
19 june 2017,sagittarius,"We’ve all heard about the 800 pound gorilla in the room–the one that just sits there and doesn’t budge. Well, if you’re feeling like more stubborn than usual, it’s because a Mercury-Saturn smackdown is turning you into that primate! You’re in no mood for compromising, and why should you? Get a banana daiquiri and chill.

"
20 june 2017,sagittarius,"Romance reboot! A sparkling Uranus-Mercury aspect puts some juice back into your union. It’s time to play more and argue less, and it will be up to you to schedule the play time (and the activities). No lover in sight, or your current amour is a dud? Then start hunting for a new love. The Sun’s move into Cancer tomorrow could bring a s sexy soulmate your way.

"
21 june 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in a superb position to rid yourself of mental demons that may be diminishing your experience of life, archer. The Sun has just entered your emotional eighth house, one of the sectors that governs our deepest emotions and feelings. The Sun’s job is to illuminate them. But in a cosmic twist of fate, rational Mercury glides into this sector too, helping you deal with them in an intelligent, drama-free manner.

"
22 june 2017,sagittarius,"Laser-like focus is a gift the cosmos is presenting to you, now that the illuminating Sun and intelligent Mercury are in your eighth house. So dig deep—into your finances, emotions, relationships, spirituality, health issues, whatever needs to be uncovered. This can become an intense exercise, but the results are worth it.

"
23 june 2017,sagittarius,"If your cash flow has been more of a trickle than a flood, cosmic help is on the way. Tomorrow’s new moon is in your net worth sector and it opens up a six-month cycle of greater prosperity. Today is a smart time to take a look at your financial picture and consider new ways of building wealth.

"
24 june 2017,sagittarius,"A wonderfully romantic time can begin in your love life thanks to a luscious new moon in your house of intimacy. However, it won’t be all moonbeams and rose petals, and in a way that’s a good thing. There’s a practical vibe in the air, making this an auspicious time to go over joint finances, household matters and the next steps to take in your union.

"
25 june 2017,sagittarius,"Sparks may fly with someone close, but these are the incendiary kind! Tempers could flare due to a Mars-Jupiter square, so keep your cool. A friend or lover may act out in a jealous or manipulative way, something that’s not going to sit well. Fortunately nurturing Neptune is in a good spot, helping you to maintain some composure.

"
26 june 2017,sagittarius,"Who’s got your back? That’s the question this week as a series of wonky aspects make you wonder. Fortunately your inner mental landscape looks calm and serene thanks to a sweet Mars-Neptune trine. And if your mind isn’t currently in that place, then take time out to meditate and seek wisdom.

"
26 june 2016,sagittarius,"With Mars retrograde over the past two months, you may have been in deep reflection about the path ahead. A magnificent trine between Jupiter and Pluto in the most ambitious part of your chart is superb for career progress. This event won’t happen again till 2024—see how important this is? Pluto is known as the great transformer, so if you’re considering changing careers, opening up your own company or blasting up the ranks at your place of employment—go for it!

"
27 june 2017,sagittarius,"Over the next few weeks you will come to realize that peace and contentment not only come from a happy home life, but within. Moody Neptune is currently retrograde in your house of comfort, urging you to toss out old ways of relating to the people you love–and that includes you!

"
27 june 2016,sagittarius,"The past two months may have felt heavy as you examined negative emotions, toxic ties, and situations that reached their sell-by date long ago. Mars in retrograde motion brought about this reverie, but now that the red planet is direct you can start to make progress—with a much lighter load. Leave the baggage behind and sally forth.

"
28 june 2017,sagittarius,"The archer has their bow and arrows out, ready to take aim and fire. There will be no holding back for you today, not with megamouth Mars meeting up with equally chatty Mercury. Letting your emotions spill is advisable, and you won’t have to rant or reach dramatic heights of filibustering. Just tell it like it is. If people don’t like it, it’s too darn bad.

"
28 june 2016,sagittarius,"Do what you love….and the money will come? That old piece of advice gets tossed around quite a bit, but whether it’s true or not is another issue. With optimistic Jupiter in your career house for the first time in twelve years, it’s not surprising if you are reconsidering your options. And Pluto is asking you to reframe the way in which you earn money. Today you may be thinking long and hard about this. Give yourself time for a solid answer.

"
29 june 2017,sagittarius,"It’s all well and good to be madly in love or passionate about your career or a goal, but practicality has to fit in there too. A tough Pluto-Mercury opposition will remind you of that, so get ready to take your head out of the clouds for a few minutes and get down to basics.

"
29 june 2016,sagittarius,"Keep the mojo in the flow! A happy, serendipitous meeting between the Moon and Uranus in your house of creativity spurs you to get those artistic juices flowing. “But I’m not in a creative line of work!” I hear you saying. Listen, it doesn’t matter if you’re a truck driver, an accountant or a stay-at-home mom. We can all find ways to bring more zest and artistry to our daily lives.

"
30 june 2017,sagittarius,"Big dreams often cost big money, something that you’re going to be keenly aware of over the next few weeks with a building Mars-Pluto opposition. But that’s OK–you’ll be able to figure it out. For now, a luscious Moon-Jupiter aspect encourages you to dream, as Jupiter is the planet of abundance. Where there’s a will there’s a way.

"
1 july 2017,sagittarius,"Hillary Clinton famously said, “It takes a village to raise a child”, and that’s the message from the cosmos to you today, Sagittarius. If you have kids you may need to start relying on the help of others to free up your time and reduce stress, whether it’s a parent or a baby sitter. Even if you’re single or don’t have to worry about child care, your family is in the planets’ crosshairs. Start resolving issues with them now.

"
1 july 2016,sagittarius,"Something is going to happen today that will give you a boost of confidence. Jupiter has been trying to get you to feel comfortable in your own skin for the past ten months, as if you’re standing in your power. Claim it–it’s yours. Don’t worry, you won’t become an egotistical beast. But you will exude an air of contented security that will make others happy to be in your presence, and bring you peace of mind a well.

"
2 july 2017,sagittarius,"With a full moon approaching next weekend in one of your money houses, you may be determined to shore up your financial affairs–a smart move. But make sure that you’re making decisions logically and that they are your own  choices. A harsh Pluto opposition today indicates that someone could try to twist your arm when it comes to spending, earning or investing. Maintain your standards.

"
2 july 2016,sagittarius,"It’s time for a little attitude readjustment! A helpful angle between the Sun and Saturn asks you to reframe your emotions about everything from love to money to family to work. Your emotions may not have been serving you the right way and it’s time to get back on a more positive track. The next two weeks will give you ample opportunities to do a lot of deep thinking and healing.

"
3 july 2017,sagittarius,"Your ability to read between the lines and figure out what’s going on behind the scenes is just plain spooky. At least, it will seem that way to other people. The reality is that the Moon is active in your house of intuition, helping you read the emotions and thoughts of others. Use this to your advantage!

"
3 july 2016,sagittarius,"The new moon tomorrow is excellent for entering into a joint venture or some kind of business arrangement, and today’s Sun-Neptune trine indicates that the family might be involved. Whether they’re actively playing a part or conveniently lending money, their presence can be a benefit. But if your family isn’t a part of this picture, the trine can bring a sense of contentment and security to the venture.

"
4 july 2017,sagittarius,"Stability and peace are going to become more important to you in the weeks ahead, thanks to the approaching full moon on Saturday in your house of security. Venus’s entry today into your house of cooperation and bonding with others will drive it home that your sense of comfort will depend on how well you get along with others…and whether or not they bring happiness or drama into your world.

"
5 july 2017,sagittarius,"It’s time to talk the talk, archer. Chatty Mercury just entered your house of big ideas, so if you are considering an audacious plan you need to have your facts straight, not to mention your finances and any other resources you may need to get going. Current planetary aspects indicate that this week is especially good for housing, family and romantic matters, so talk things over with loved ones.

"
5 july 2016,sagittarius,"This is an excellent day to handle residential and family matters, as Mercury trines Neptune in your house of domestic issues. If there has been confusion or indecision the time is right for talking things over. Even more progress can be made tomorrow.

"
6 july 2017,sagittarius,"Other people may be hell bent on making you feel guilty or jealous, but don’t let them push those buttons. Let their s*** be their s***. With the upcoming full moon falling in your house of healthy self-respect, you don’t have time for taking on someone else’s head games.

"
6 july 2016,sagittarius,"If there was ever a day to hold a deep and meaningful conversation with a lover, this is it. Mars and Venus form a gorgeous angle in the heavens, enabling you to dig deep into your psyche and release old fears, grudges, or concerns. You can also get in touch with the happiest of emotions as well! Singles, you’re not left out. Stale, worn-out feelings of not being good enough, or attracting the wrong kind of lover, can be tossed to to the curb.

"
7 july 2017,sagittarius,"Need to pare back a bit? An overly optimistic attitude on your part could lead to taking on more than you can handle. The good news is that three planets are in your house of taking a chance, diving into new experiences. The downside is that there aren’t enough hours in a day (and other resources) to do them all well! Tomorrow’s full moon will help you trim your list.

"
7 july 2016,sagittarius,"Fiscal responsibility is what it’s all about today, as planets in your money houses are at war. Keep the plastic in your wallet and think twice before taking out loans on expensive items, such as a house, car or boat. A lover or child may act out, making demands about spending. Don’t give in.

"
8 july 2016,sagittarius,"Great day to talk about inking a deal, forming a partnership or entering into a lucrative investment. With talkative Mercury in a helpful angle with Jupiter in your house of power brokers, you can easily bring people over to your way of thinking. Mars is active in your confidentiality sector, though, urging discretion—at least for the time being.

"
9 july 2017,sagittarius,"Material success is not what life is all about, archer, something that you need to remember. Warring planets may find you too focused on making money or building up your net worth. While these are important, so is taking the optimistic view that things will work out. Sometimes you need to step away from something in order to let it grow.

"
9 july 2016,sagittarius,"Nothing is sexier than a person who knows what they want out of life! That kind of single-minded focus adds a certain “je ne sais quoi” to your allure. With the impassioned Moon gliding past advantageous Jupiter today, you’re stepping into a more powerful position. Use it to charm, and disarm!

"
10 july 2017,sagittarius,"You may be worth far more than what you’re currently being paid, so don’t be shy about either asking for more money or traveling down a more lucrative path. Once Mars and the Sun enter Leo later in the month, your options will open up. Keep an open mind about fresh opportunities.

"
10 july 2016,sagittarius,"Sometimes you have to pull away from the madding crowd just to get your thoughts and emotions in perspective. Two superb planetary angles tell you to go within, not just to release the negative stuff but to get in touch with your own power. As shaman Don Matus told author Carlos Castaneda, we all have an inner voice that will lead us to answers and serenity, but it is obscured by all the “noise” we are surrounded by.

"
11 july 2017,sagittarius,"Getting back on the same page with someone (or a group of people) gets easier with the Moon in your third house of eloquent speech. Express your opinions, as other people need to know what’s on your mind. Thursday is an even better day for showcasing your ideas.

"
11 july 2016,sagittarius,"You may be ready to share your deepest thoughts with someone close, but they may not be. A tense aspect between communicative Mercury and unpredictable Uranus indicates that a lover or child may act up today, making you wonder if you’ll ever be able to talk things through. Fortunately, both Venus and Mercury glide into your expansive ninth house this week, helping you view the situation from a higher perspective.

"
12 july 2017,sagittarius,"Structure and discipline often sound pretty gruesome–after all, who wants to be confined to doing things a certain way! But you would be wise to create more routines both at home and at work. With the Moon in your comfort-driven fourth house, the more order you have around you, the more serene you’ll feel.

"
12 july 2016,sagittarius,"Ready to put yourself out there when it comes to romance? Love planet Venus enters your house of taking chances! You’ll be willing to take a gamble on someone new if you’ve been off the market for awhile. On the fence about cohabitating or getting engaged? Your courage and optimism should rise. Coupled archers could consider a more exciting love life, which might mean soul searing sex, a weekly date night, or making plans to go abroad on an exotic adventure. If you’ve been unhappy in love, Venus’s entry into Leo could light a fire under you to seek more independence. One door closes, another one opens!

"
13 july 2017,sagittarius,"Need to have a heart to heart conversation with someone close? Then do so today, as a Neptune-Moon conjunction will help the words flow. Even if the other person isn’t ready to hear what you have to say, you’ve put it out there. How they respond is their issue.

"
13 july 2016,sagittarius,"Go global! The entry of Mercury into your expansive ninth house signals a time of growth. Stop thinking small. Got a local business? Consider going statewide, or even national. Own a brick and mortar store? Then maybe it’s time to take it online as well. If obtaining a higher degree would make you stand out from the rest of the pack, start looking at college curricula. Hiding in the shadows never helped anyone.

"
14 july 2017,sagittarius,"You know what you want and how to get it, thanks to intelligent Mercury in your think-big sector. But you won’t succeed if you try to do it all on your own. As a matter of fact, your greatest chance of success comes from either teaming up with others or seeking the advice of a savvy mentor.

"
14 july 2016,sagittarius,"The cosmos is suggesting that you take a different approach to dealing with the people in your circle, especially children and lovers. Uranus is making them act in unpredictable ways, but with Mars so active in your house of intuition, you’ll be able to get to the root of their behavior without much difficulty. Pay attention to subtle clues.

"
15 july 2017,sagittarius,"Following your head versus your heart is a dilemma that we all face from time to time. In your case, archer, today the heart will win. It’s a good time to open up and let someone know what you think and how you feel. This may make you feel vulnerable, but the end result will be worth it.

"
15 july 2016,sagittarius,"When we watch sports stars, singers and actors perform, or artists who are at the top of their game, it all looks so effortless, doesn’t it? But often times people don’t pay attention to the long hours and discipline that went on behind the scenes. That’s the message the stars have for you, Sagittarius–figure out the routines, habits and positive thought patterns that will help you turn your dreams into reality. Saturn will help them stick.

"
16 july 2017,sagittarius,"They say that sharing is caring, and this is especially true in matters of the heart. But today’s frisky, flirty aspects indicate that you just want to have some fun and not get dragged into deep discussions. Serious talks can wait!

"
16 july 2016,sagittarius,"How high can you fly? With Venus and Mercury in the most adventurous part of your chart, how far you go is up to you. These two meet in the heavens, urging you to consider your options. Deep emotional thoughts may bubble to the surface, but that’s part of the process. When the Sun enters this part of the sky on the 22nd, it’s all systems go.

"
17 july 2017,sagittarius,"Is someone clinging to you like a piece of lint? Or maybe it’s the other way around. Neediness rears its annoying little head today, and someone is going to end up feeling suffocated. There’s a time and place for being emo and today is not one of them. Back off.

"
17 july 2016,sagittarius,"The Moon spends a few fleeting hours in your sign today, but that’s just enough to get you centered on your desires! A happy trine between La Luna and Uranus will spur you to seek out more fun, juicier romance, trying a new sport or heading off to some concerts and art galleries. When the Sun enters Leo this Friday, you’ll be even more motivated to live life to the fullest.

"
18 july 2017,sagittarius,"A more sociable time is about to open up for you once Mars enters Leo on Thursday, but the cosmos is saying–why wait to get the party started? A happy Venus-Jupiter aspect today is perfect for going out to dinner with your friends, not to mention finding a new amour (all the more reason to go out!).

"
18 july 2016,sagittarius,"Our habits run our lives, and they can be difficult to break. That’s why Pluto is around, to point out to us the changes we need to make. Today the dwarf planet asks you to analyze your methods of saving and spending money, in addition to how you earn it. Mercury and Venus are pushing you to go outside your comfort zone and live a bolder life, and that includes your income level. Why think small?

"
19 july 2017,sagittarius,"This is one of the best days of the year to enter into an agreement, sign a contract or commit to a plan that can open up your world in a big way: going to college or night school, for example, or launching an entrepreneurial venture. Don’t dawdle: energetic Mars moves into Leo tomorrow, putting rocket boosters on your plans.

"
19 july 2016,sagittarius,"The money doctor is in the house, and he wants to perform a checkup on your cash flow! The full moon in Capricorn is your key to nailing down a new, higher-paying gig, establishing a budget, and developing thrifty habits that will enable you to save more. But Uranus is in a difficult angle from your house of love and children. The message? Your kids don’t need $300 kicks or the latest electronic gizmo. Spending too much on dating or pleasing a lover is not the way to go. The cosmos isn’t telling you to be cheap, but to carefully consider expenditures. Have fun, yet save money at the same time.

"
20 july 2017,sagittarius,"The future’s so bright, I have to wear shades! That may be your mantra over the next few weeks as megawatt Mars moves into the most optimistic part of your chart. Nothing is going to stop you from going after your heart’s desire.

"
20 july 2016,sagittarius,"You’re known for being the risk taker of the zodiac, Sagittarius, boldly pushing into new territory. But sometimes the most intrepid of explorers gets into a rut. With sober Saturn in your house of self, chances are you’ve been holding back over the past year, opting to play if safe. That’s about to change. Today Saturn greenlights Venus, saying that it’s OK to take your foot off the brake and get some momentum going.

"
21 july 2017,sagittarius,"Your emotions could be more volatile than a gas can with a lit match about to be dropped into it, archer. Unless you want to explode and deal with ensuing dramatic aftermath, it’s time to take a deep breath and maybe pull away from a nerve wracking situation. The good news is that the Sun enters Leo, the most happy-go-lucky part of your chart tomorrow.

"
21 july 2016,sagittarius,"With intelligent Mercury scheduled to enter your career house on the 30th, the chance to showcase your talents is approaching. In order to make the most of this, a Moon-Jupiter angle today suggests that you rework your method of communicating with people in positions of authority. Do you need to respond more quickly to e-mails? Show that you’re a team player? Take a more chill attitude? Figure it out–then put the changes in motion.

"
22 july 2017,sagittarius,"Feeling visionary? You should be now that the Sun is in Leo! It’s time to think about living a more authentic life, even if that means breaking away from the image that others have of you. Don’t hide your light under a bushel.

"
22 july 2016,sagittarius,"Your sign doesn’t like being held down, Sagittarius, and now that the Sun is in frisky Leo, you’ll be ready to charge ahead! How does the title “best-selling author” sound? Or how about “intrepid explorer”, “Ph.D.” or “entrepreneurial whiz”? Now’s the time to stretch past your boundaries.

"
23 july 2017,sagittarius,"With a new moon in Leo, you’re going to want to pursue some interesting challenges and goals, such as going to grad school, starting a business or traveling around the world. But like a kid in a candy shop with a $100 bill in your hand, your eyes may be bigger than your stomach. Be selective about what you dive in to.

"
23 july 2016,sagittarius,"You could find yourself in quite a nostalgic mood as the Moon connects with Neptune in the heavens. Memories from the past, especially those involving women in your family, may bubble up to the surface of your mind. Why not honor these special ladies with a prayer, a meditation practice or by lighting a candle? Pull out some old photos and reminisce.

"
24 july 2017,sagittarius,"Your sign is known for being an ever-optimistic pioneer, and today the cosmos is telling you to pursue your heart’s desire. However, a business or romantic partner may put up resistance, making you feel guilty about the pursuit. This is no time to worry about their expectations; keep moving forward.

"
24 july 2016,sagittarius,"With the Sun now in the most independent, footloose part of your chart, you may be itching for some excitement. Well scratch that itch, Sag! A fun Moon-Sun trine urges you to get out of the house and enjoy some new experiences. Whether it’s trying a new sport, learning a new language, or popping into a restaurant with cuisine from a far off land, the message from the cosmos is to live a little.

"
25 july 2017,sagittarius,"Now that Mercury is in your career and goals sector you can make excellent progress. The only issue is that you may try to take on too much, burning out in the process. You will  need the support of decision makers and authority figures to get ahead, so be diplomatic while you show off your talents and can-do attitude.

"
25 july 2016,sagittarius,"The glittering full moon on the 19th was designed to take your income up a notch–or two or three! You may have already started on the next phase of your wealth building plan, but planetary influences suggest that there could be opposition. No surprise there! People tend to get nervous when they see others hustling. Today a romantic partner could voice their opinions. But it’s also possible that in your desire to make progress you could be neglecting the people you love, like kids and the SO. Maintain balance as you forge ahead.

"
26 july 2017,sagittarius,"This is one of the best days all year to pursue a big plan or dream that has been bouncing around in your mind for way too long. Mars and the Sun meet up in your brainy yet adventurous ninth house, so this is the perfect time to go for it.

"
26 july 2016,sagittarius,"You’ll be inspired to get on top of your workload, whether at home or at the office. With the Moon in the most meticulous, organized part of your chart, inertia will be overcome as momentum builds. Pluto in your income sector is ready to show you more cash, but you need to have solid routines in place beforehand.

"
27 july 2017,sagittarius,"It’s wonderful to have big dreams, but do they really align with your values? And do the people in your world share the same core principles as you? Get straight on this before you charge ahead with your plans.

"
27 july 2016,sagittarius,"Something could spur you into taking a fortuitous chance, and you’ll be glad you did. Say “yes” to a lunch date, the seminar invitation, the trip, the class, the brand new idea. The cosmos is pushing you into a place of change and fresh new adventures and people, but you have to be open to possibilities.

"
28 july 2017,sagittarius,"Are your dreams way bigger than your budget? That may be the case, but it doesn’t mean that your dreams are impossible. Just make sure that anything you decide to go after is your  aspiration. Don’t let jealousy of what other people appear to have to be driving your decisions.

"
28 july 2016,sagittarius,"Tireless Mars is working overtime in your behind-the-scenes sector, creating a laser-like focus that enables you to see the real picture. Which can be good–or bad!

"
29 july 2017,sagittarius,"You and someone close may not see eye to eye today, but that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t share your feelings. Being open and honest about what you’re thinking will help matters, which could actually start to improve tomorrow.

"
29 july 2016,sagittarius,"You’re an adventurous sort, Sagittarius, but even the most intrepid voyager needs some down time to recharge their batteries. Uranus has just gone retro in your house of fun, love and creativity. No one’s telling you to join the priesthood, but you may want to cut back on social engagements as you spend more quality time with your kids and loved ones. A romantic partner could be indecisive or difficult to read, so patience will be your virtue here.

"
30 july 2017,sagittarius,"Sweet! Amorous Venus has your back, and there could be some unexpected adventures in store for you. So get yourself dolled up and plan on making a splash. Of all the signs of the zodiac, you are the most likely to turn heads today.

Now is the time to launch career endeavors that will take you to a higher level of responsibility and earnings.

"
31 july 2017,sagittarius,"Financial matters begin to ease now that Venus is in your net worth sector. You’re in a good position to dream up new ways of earning money, too, especially from passive sources or a side business. Entrepreneurial ventures are favored for you right now, so don’t be afraid to take a chance on your own talents.

"
31 july 2016,sagittarius,"“Attention, Sagittarius shoppers! There’s a blue light special in aisle 3.”  But run for the door, archer, no matter how good the deal may be. You run the risk of emotional spending today, and it won’t be on small stuff either. Best bet: don’t go to the mall, car dealership or marina. Work off your sentiments at the gym instead.

"
1 august 2017,sagittarius,"Get in touch with your feelings–stat! With erratic Uranus about to retrograde in your romance sector, you need to figure out which end is up in your relationship. And if you’re single it’s wise to get clear about the kind of person you want to attract. Don’t put anyone on a pedestal and live on emotions alone. Some logic is necessary.

Your days of sitting along the sidelines, trying to figure out what to do next, are coming to an end as clarity hits you like a ton of bricks.

Tomorrow’s new moon kicks open a six-month cycle of ambition.

"
2 august 2017,sagittarius,"Knowing what you want out of life is half the battle, while the rest often requires hard work. Fortunately you can get clear on the former as the Moon conjuncts Saturn, bringing crystal clear focus to your plans. Next week’s eclipse is perfect for tying it all together and then hitting the “launch” button.

"
2 august 2016,sagittarius,"One door closes, another one opens. Red-hot Mars moves into Sagittarius today, its second trip to this part of the sky in 2016. But what makes this visit different is that a new moon occurs in the most adventurous and optimistic part of your chart. If there was ever a time to leave the past behind, this is it. Get off the fence and make the decision to live your life your way.

"
3 august 2017,sagittarius,"Just how much drama do you want in your life? Figure that out stat. If you don’t want much then you’ll need to set some boundaries with the people around you—especially a lover and kids—because erratic Uranus retrogrades today in the sector that governs them. Make sure that you’re not the lead actor in a soap opera either; generating drama at your end will backfire.

"
3 august 2016,sagittarius,"With Mars now in your house of self-image and passion projects, your desire to go after some juicy goals is increasing. Today the Moon in Leo winks at spontaneous Uranus as they conspire to ratchet up your creativity level.

"
4 august 2017,sagittarius,"You’re in quite a social place with abundant Jupiter in your house of camaraderie, but sometimes this can lead to group pressure: to conform, own certain things, be in a relationship and so on.

"

"

"
5 august 2016,sagittarius,"“It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” We’re all familiar with that saying. And with Venus entering your house of success today, you may start thinking about who you can impress in order to advance your ambitions. But a strained angle with Mars might create a “who needs them?” kind of an attitude. Maybe you are  better off relying on yourself.

"
6 august 2017,sagittarius,"Some last minute snafus could upset a project at work or at home. The same holds true for plans to meet with friends or loved ones. If this is a recurring problem, it may be time to create better routines for yourself and demand them of others as well.

"
6 august 2016,sagittarius,"Sturdy, serious Saturn and assertive Mars are powering their way through your house of self-image and goals. So why are you holding back, not sure what to do next?

"
7 august 2017,sagittarius,"Big ideas can take flight, thanks to a lunar eclipse in Aquarius that highlights some of your deepest thoughts!

"
7 august 2016,sagittarius,"You’re ready to start making solid decisions about your future, Sagittarius, whether the matter deals with love, residential status, money, family ties or business. But before you commit to a particular course of action or person, step back. Better yet, give yourself a few days to consider your options. A tense Mercury-Neptune opposition indicates that others may not be putting all of their cards on the table.

"
8 august 2017,sagittarius,"Yesterday’s fortuitous eclipse fell in your socializing sector, making your neighborhood, city, pals and co-workers the best way to meet new folks.

When Saturn goes direct on Saturday you’ll be able to pick the most appetizing (and lucrative) passion projects to pursue.

"
9 august 2017,sagittarius,"Big plans may need to be reined back a bit as Pluto demands more structure. Perhaps expenses are getting out of hand, or an idea is too complicated to tackle in its current state. With Mercury retrograding on Saturday, it’s actually wise to slow things down and take one small step at a time.

"
9 august 2016,sagittarius,"Over the past few days you may have struggled with keeping the people around you happy, as they have vied for your attention and time. But what about your needs and desires? Resentment may be building. However, a sweet Venus-Moon angle today allows you to take some quiet time to ruminate over your  passions. Both Venus and Mercury are asking you to step into a more authoritative role, something that you may not feel comfortable with. That will change this weekend.

"

"
12 august 2017,sagittarius,"Your brain should be sizzling with big ideas, archer, thanks to the mighty Sun and ambitious Mars in your big picture ninth house.

Not to worry–spend the next three weeks working on polishing them up.

"
12 august 2016,sagittarius,"Ready, aim, fire! The archer has an arrow lined up in the bow and is ready to take aim. That’s because the passionate Moon has entered your sign, swinging past Mars and Saturn. Ambition rises, energy builds, thinking becomes clearer–and you’re ready to move forward. If others around you have a hard time with that, they’re just going to have to deal with it.

"
13 august 2017,sagittarius,"If there’s one message that the cosmos has for you these days, it’s to bust out of restricting conditions and old ways of thinking. Ironically, living on the edge often requires a new set of habits, which can seem like another form of restrictions! But this time it’s not. People who push the envelope will all tell you that they needed to switch to a new mindset in order to live a larger life.

"
13 august 2016,sagittarius,"Yee-ha! Saturn goes direct today in your sign, ending five months of delays which could have occurred in just about any area of your life. Part of the problem is that you may have felt conflicted as to which direction to head in, but that’s what a retrograde period is for–to get to the bottom of issues.

Venus is in a good position to help you create boundaries politely and effortlessly without a lot of drama.

"
15 august 2017,sagittarius,"It’s not like your independent spirit to be stuck in a resentful or mistrustful mindset, so snap out of it if you are. You can’t control what others are doing and saying. Besides, by the time of next week’s eclipse you probably won’t care too much anymore!

"
15 august 2016,sagittarius,"A new idea could come your way for making more money, whether it’s adding a product or service to your company or the idea that you might just start shopping your resume.

"
16 august 2017,sagittarius,"With next week’s solar eclipse occurring in the most adventurous part of your chart, you should be jonesing for some fun. And today’s lunar activity tells you to stop feeling so damn responsible for everyone around you, that you actually feel guilty about letting loose a little bit. Start planning some escapades.

"
16 august 2016,sagittarius,"The archer is known for being one of the most independent signs of the zodiac, always ready for change and a challenge.

A superb Sun-Uranus trine will shake you out of a rut or living life a little too conservatively. Open your mind–you never know what fabulous new ideas might fly in.

"
17 august 2017,sagittarius,"Jealousy just ain’t pretty, whether it’s coming your way from a “friend” or if it’s bubbling up inside of you. Today the green-eyed monster slithers out of its cave, so steer clear of known malcontents. And avoid comparing your life to others, whether it’s your tribe or the latest social media darling. Your day in the Sun is coming—at next Monday’s solar eclipse, to be precise.

"
17 august 2016,sagittarius,"Powerful planetary forces are at work, urging you to make some major decisions about the next phase of your life. You’ll be feeling this even more intensely as the 24th approaches, a day when Mars and Saturn meet in your house of goals and passion projects. A super Venus-Pluto trine today helps you dig down into matters of emotional and financial security.

"
19 august 2016,sagittarius,"With intelligent Mercury moving ever closer to lucky Jupiter, you should be becoming more motivated to get things done.

You may have to set some boundaries, otherwise you’ll be too busy pleasing others to accomplish your passion projects.

"
20 august 2016,sagittarius,"There’s a time and place for everything, Sagittarius. Incessantly worrying about the future or stressing over job-related nonsense will take its toll on your quality time with your family and loved ones, not to mention your physical health. The planets urge you to stay focused on the moment–this  moment–and forget your cares for the weekend. They will still be there on Monday.

"
21 august 2016,sagittarius,"The Moon in the most creative part of your chart is stimulating your desire to live a bit more authentically. Yes, it helps to play the game sometimes at the office or within the family just to keep the peace, but other times you just gotta let the world know what you’re all about. And now’s the time!

"
22 august 2016,sagittarius,"You’re on fire this week, archer. The authoritative Sun blazes into your ambition sector today, joining three other benevolent planets that are determined to help you achieve your heart’s desire. Today you might hear news about a job offer or business deal that’s about to come your way, thanks to a meeting between planet of negotiation Mercury and profitable, lucky Jupiter. Then on Wednesday Mars and Saturn shake hands, clarifying what moves you need to make next.

"
23 august 2016,sagittarius,"You’re the envy of the zodiac, archer, as Mars and Saturn are getting ready to meet up in your sign tomorrow. Just about any dream or passion you’d like to go after can be attained, with Saturn helping you make wise choices and Mars lighting a fire under your tush. But tense angles today with neptune and a slew of other planets in Virgo suggest that you need to set some boundaries with both your family and your job before you set things in motion. Otherwise, you’ll get so lost in their demands that you won’t have time for you.

"
24 august 2016,sagittarius,"This day has your name written all over it, Sagittarius! A meeting between Mars and Saturn in your sign sets the stage for making important decisions of all kinds: romantic, business, family, financial, health, you name it. The wonderful part is that Mars will provide you with the ambition to get rolling while Saturn will keep fantasy-fueled thinking in check. Just don’t expect overnight success. You’re in this for the long haul.

"
25 august 2016,sagittarius,"You’re ready to move ahead with bold new plans, thanks to a conjunction yesterday between Mars and Saturn. And with so many planets in Virgo, your house of authority, you should be feeling stronger and in control. But not everyone is going to agree with your plans and the new can-do attitude. A romantic or business partner may voice their opposition today, and family members could be crotchety on Friday. Please. You can’t live your life living by someone else’s rules.

"
26 august 2016,sagittarius,"Paging singer Rick Nelson, circa 1972:” It’s all right now, I’ve learned my lesson well. You can’t please everyone, so you gotta please yourself.” And that’s the message the cosmos has for you today, archer. You may realize that family members and others are intruding too much upon your personal life or your serenity and that you need to take a timeout. Go for it; clear your head.

"
27 august 2016,sagittarius,"Ready for your closeup? I hope so, because a meeting between Jupiter and Venus is designed to get your name, reputation and face in front of some pretty interesting people.

This vibe continues into early next week, so enjoy it.

"
28 august 2016,sagittarius,"A number of planets are firing up your authoritative tenth house, telling you to take more control of your life and the relationships you currently have. This may require prioritizing, and under today’s lunar aspects, you may feel conflicted. Family members and lovers may be receiving notice from you in the weeks ahead that you need more time for you

"
29 august 2016,sagittarius,"Which direction to head in? That question may be on your mind when it comes to career matters as Mercury retrogrades in your ambition sector tomorrow. If you need inspiration–or answers–your best bet is to network like crazy over the next few weeks as Venus enters your house of teams and friends. Attend industry events, go to seminars, talk to people in other fields, and hunker down with a trusted pal to vet your ideas.

"
30 august 2016,sagittarius,"It’s time to figure out what you truly want out of life as Mercury retrogrades in your house of priorities and achievement. It’s super important that you set aside a few hours to do so as a solar eclipse takes place in the same part of the sky on Thursday, opening up many new doors. Know which ones you want to walk through, whether it’s in love, career, where you live, or the kind of lifestyle you want to enjoy.

"
31 august 2016,sagittarius,"Your most deeply held desires and dreams are now center stage, thanks to luscious Venus gracing the part of the chart where we imagine the future. And with Mercury now traveling backward in your house of ambition and success, chances are that goals that were shelved awhile back may now be up for reconsideration. Don’t assume that just because something didn’t work out before that it won’t now.

"
1 september 2016,sagittarius,"A powerful solar eclipse in the most ambitious part of your chart can usher in fast-moving changes that will propel your career and income upward. So why the foot dragging? Blame that on serious Saturn issuing warnings from your house of self-image, saying that you shouldn’t try to go too far too fast. Listen, Saturn is a wise old dude. It makes sense. However, the speed at which eclipses work may mean that you’ll have to make snap decisions, so start considering your options now.

"
2 september 2016,sagittarius,"It’s time to rebrand yourself, Sagittarius! With a sparkling aspect between Jupiter and Mercury, you need to create an image of confidence, self-control and an easy-going authority.

"
3 september 2016,sagittarius,"With the Moon linking love planet Venus in your house of camaraderie, this is a great weekend for singles to meet someone at a social event, via an introduction from a BFF, or even online. Coupled up archers should make plans to get together with others, as this is a weekend to mingle, not cocoon at home. There’s even a possibility that an acquaintance could tip you off about a job opening, so if you’re looking to make a switch, get your feelers out there.

"
4 september 2016,sagittarius,"The planets are anxious to help you develop strong friendships and alliances that will stand the test of time. But socializing with people simply because they’re fun to hang out with may not be in your best interests. Listen, the cosmos isn’t asking you to join a convent. It is asking, however, that you choose your company wisely, looking for more than just shared interests.

"
5 september 2016,sagittarius,"Try to wrap up job interviews, major presentations to clients and any big changes to your firm that are underway.

Because that’s where the big planet is heading next–your house of camaraderie.

"
6 september 2016,sagittarius,"Feeling stuck? A difficult Sun-Saturn-Neptune triangle in the sky could make you feel resentful toward people or situations that you perceive to be holding you back. But with the Moon in your secretive twelfth house slyly winking at life-changing Pluto, it may be time to consider some newer, more exciting options.

"
7 september 2016,sagittarius,"This is one heck of a day when it comes to furthering your ambitions! And if you’re unsure as to what they are, a helpful Venus-Saturn angle will enable you to look into the future and pinpoint the smartest choices. You might want to take a look first at your career, as a magnificent trine between the Sun and Pluto in your success sector wants to bring your more responsibility and a lot more dinero.

"
8 september 2016,sagittarius,"For the first time in over a decade, generous and optimistic Jupiter glides into the house of your deepest wishes and goals tomorrow.

"
9 september 2016,sagittarius,"Tech wizardry could be the key to success for you this year, Sagittarius, as lucky Jupiter enters your house of the digital world. Archers who want to meet a love online, code an app, kick off a website or an online store can rock it.

Collaborations can be the key to success, whether it’s finding play dates for the kids or creating an industry brain trust.

"
10 september 2016,sagittarius,"You’re on quite a practical streak these days, thanks to hosting serious Saturn in your house of self. This is beneficial as you can make plans for the future based on logic rather than wishful thinking. But today deceptive Neptune is active, stirring up doubts about your security, be it emotional or financial. Let this pass. With Jupiter now in your house of big plans, the pieces will fall into place.

"
11 september 2016,sagittarius,"Trying to keep up with the Joneses? A tense Pluto-Venus square could find you comparing your life to those of your pals, especially if it seems as though they have “more” than you–more love, more success, or more security. Sit tight. With both Mars and Saturn in your house of self-esteem and goals, you’ll be able to go after what you want–and get it.

"
12 september 2016,sagittarius,"A job situation may have you on edge in the early part of this week, as bosses, clients or co-workers may be on one heck of a power trip. The smart archer zips their lips and says little. Red-hot Mars is in your sign, causing you to want to fight back or be quite vocal. Let this pass and wait until the 20th and the 23rd, two excellent days for making progress.

"
13 september 2016,sagittarius,"First, the good news: the fiery Sun is in your career house, aiming to move you upward, while assertive Mars is in your self-esteem sector, helping you feel more confident. Now for the downside: they’re squaring each other today, which is not the best of angles. You run the risk of coming on too strong with an authority figure, or could feel stuck and powerless in a situation that is not to your liking. Wait until the 19th for clarity and forward momentum.

"
14 september 2016,sagittarius,"A sparking aspect between the Moon and Uranus will make it so much easier today to communicate with your kids or a lover. With Mars in your sign, you run the risk of coming on too strong, and you may have been resorting to heavy-handed tactics as of late. But that won’t be necessary today, and with this week’s eclipse in your domestic sector, you should be looking forward to a more peaceful time ahead.

"
15 september 2016,sagittarius,"A rather surprising yet happy event could take place in love, as a number of planets are smiling at each other in the heavens.

With Mars in your house of self-esteem, don’t settle for any less than that.

"
16 september 2016,sagittarius,"You’re known for being the daredevil of the zodiac, Sagittarius, but today’s lunar eclipse is all about settling down! Don’t worry, you’re not going to lose your mojo. But you could be a lot more interested in the six months ahead to feather your nest, whether that means buying or leasing a new place, redecorating, or moving in with someone. If that includes hearing the pitter patter of little feet, the cosmos might deliver!

"
17 september 2016,sagittarius,"You can’t help it if you’re hot! Or as the commercial used to say, “Don’t hate me because I’m beautiful.” Such a weight to bear, Sagittarius! With lusty Mars in your house of self-image forming a simmering, sexy trine with maverick Uranus, you have no choice but to turn heads and attract admirers. Just don’t rush into a new relationship, especially if you’re still in one.

"
18 september 2016,sagittarius,"To thine own self be true. Listen to your own inner voice, Sagittarius, as the voices of other people may become a little too loud for your taste. Friends may mean well, but when listening to their advice you have to consider what is best for you. An acquaintance may overstep their bounds, providing you with opinions that weren’t solicited. Be your own guru.

"
19 september 2016,sagittarius,"There will be a lot of new faces in your orbit as the year progresses, thanks to optimistic Jupiter in your house of networking. If you’re looking for love, a sparkling Mars-Venus aspect could bring an introduction from a friend, or success online (gasp!).

"
22 september 2016,sagittarius,"It’s now what you know, it’s who you know. Truer words were never spoken as far as archers are concerned, considering that the Sun enters your house of networking today. Over the next four weeks you should reach out to as many people as possible as joining forces is your best bet for making progress in all areas of your life. Find an exercise buddy, join an industry group, or go online to meet a new love.

"
23 september 2016,sagittarius,"Deep emotions and thoughts could bubble up to the surface today, and you may want to keep them to yourself.  The wisdom of friends and confidantes could be off, so sharing your innermost ideas could result in confusion. Be your own guide and guru.

9 december 2016,sagittarius,"You’re on the verge of making some major life decisions as the Sun moves closer to lining up with Saturn on Saturday. Today provides you with the opportunity to crystallize your plans, as abundant Jupiter is active in your house of deeply held wishes. One thing’s for sure—you’re stepping into a place where you feel more powerful and in control. Don’t let anything stand in your way.

"
10 december 2016,sagittarius,"It may still be your birthday season in the cosmos, but it won’t be all champagne, confetti and chocolate cake. Today the planets take a more serious turn, but this is a good thing. Saturn, the planet of long-term planning, meets up with the Sun in your sign, which will have huge ramifications on your future. These two are holding a power lunch to discuss the steps you’re going to take next in your path through life and it’s time to make some big decisions. Whatever you decide to do, Saturn will give the discipline and logic to see through to the very end. Choose what needs to say and what has to go.

"
11 december 2016,sagittarius,"Want more serenity? You don’t have to buy dream catchers, crystals and incense. Nor do you need to chant mantras as you gaze at your navel. No, the cosmos has far more practical advice for you today: establish better, smarter routines. The good thing about good habits is that we kind of get into automatic pilot with them, freeing up our brains so that we can just chill. Want mind like water? Then your chores and responsibilities need to flow.

"
12 december 2016,sagittarius,"Love is in the air, but which way is the wind blowing? The skies are changeable thanks to rebellious Uranus acting up. Over the next few days you may question which direction to head in when it comes to a romantic alliance: split up? Get married? Have another baby? Date that new person who’s caught your eye? Don’t make any fast decisions with the full moon falling in your commitment sector tomorrow. Give it time.

"
13 december 2016,sagittarius,"Some of the biggest decisions you’ll ever make in life are about the people you surround yourself with, and today’s full moon in Gemini forces you to examine close ties. If someone isn’t adding joy to your life, or if they’re not supportive of you, why are you involved with them? Sharing the same values is also key, and this lunation shines its light on what’s most important to you. Whether you remain or decide to go, know that wise old Saturn has your back.

"
14 december 2016,sagittarius,"It’s one thing to be friendly and outgoing, another to be too open to hanging out with anyone who’s around! Be discriminate about the company you keep these days, archer. Between now and next October you can meet a number of interesting, vibrant people who can become friends (or lovers!) for life. However, a tough aspect today indicates that you need to be choosy. This isn’t about being an elitist but instead a good judge of character.

"
15 december 2016,sagittarius,"Every hurricane has a calm center known as the eye, and that’s where you need to be today, metaphorically speaking! People around you seem to have their knickers in a twist, being unsure of what they’re doing. Or worse—they seem determined to push your buttons. If you react, you’ll get sucked into their dramas faster than you can say “quicksand”. Don’t get involved.

"
17 december 2016,sagittarius,"Cue Abba, circa 1978: “Take a chance on me!”  That’s your motto today as the Moon enters the most adventurous part of your chart. Ask someone out on a date, ask for the order, sign up for adult ed classes, take a gamble that you can do something else for a living. Don’t worry, the decisions you make will be grounded. Mars enters your house of security on Monday, so you won’t do anything too rash.

"
18 december 2016,sagittarius,"Filters, please! Watch what you say with the emotional Moon opposing aggressive Mars. What you consider to be an honest opinion or objective observation could be taken quite differently by the recipient. Save important conversations for the 25th, which serves up not just one but three fabulous planetary aspects for communicating with your tribe.

"
19 december 2016,sagittarius,"Money talks and it’s telling you to slow your roll. Mercury retrogrades in your house of earning, spending and saving money. Need I say more? Just because something’s on sale doesn’t mean that you should buy it. Holiday gifts spending shouldn’t be over the top. As a matter of fact, when the Sun enters capricorn on Wednesday, it will encourage you to start saving for home-related expenses. Think about long term assets rather than instant gratification.

"
20 december 2016,sagittarius,"A strong, healthy sense of self-worth often comes from enjoying financial security and that’s what the cosmos wants to give you. But this isn’t about winning a lottery or becoming a reality TV star. Sorry—you’ll have to work for it! But it will only add to your self esteem as you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing that you did it on your own.

"
21 december 2016,sagittarius,"With the Sun now in the house of earnings you can make huge strides when it comes to seeing more cash. Get the ball rolling now and don’t let the holidays get in your way, as the week after Christmas has one super aspect after another for earning more dinero. The new moon on the 29th kicks open doors that may have been closed in the past. Make sure you’re ready to walk through them.

"
22 december 2016,sagittarius,"Figuring out whom to trust can be dicey this week. Your friends may be saying one thing, your lover another and your intuition yet something else. Perhaps it isn’t that these folks can’t be trusted, but that there’s too much information coming at you from too many sources. The new moon on the 29th will help you get grounded and figure out your next step.

"
23 december 2016,sagittarius,"Motivation to resolve a family or housing issue may rise, a smart move before the holidays. The 25th brings three super Venus aspects that will enable you to communicate freely with loved ones, from friends to kids to your amour. There may have been some drama lately in close relationships, but that should start to dissipate after Uranus goes direct on the 29th.

"
24 december 2016,sagittarius,"It’s time to make some serious decisions about the direction you’re heading in. Whether it’s love, lifestyle or career, a more exciting, creative way of life is calling your name. The question is: are you listening? The new moon on the 29th will help set you on the right path.

"
25 december 2016,sagittarius,"The lines of communication are open wide with charismatic Venus in your house of self-expression. Today the golden girl of the solar system is pushing hard to find you new friends and perhaps even a lover, so by all means reach out to people and make plans! You couldn’t ask for better aspects than this at holiday time when so many people are socializing. Be a social butterfly this week.

"
26 december 2016,sagittarius,"They say that people make the world go ’round, but today you may feel like pulling away from the madding crowd. A rare Jupiter-Uranus opposition could put you in the middle of dramas starring your friends and lover, and the problem is that you won’t be able to keep everyone happy. It’s time to become more selective about the company you keep. As we grow personally, there may be some connections that don’t match who you’ve become. Keep that in mind.

"
27 december 2016,sagittarius,"No one likes controversy but you seem to be surrounded by it as friends and loved ones are acting out. The good news is that you can find contentment among the squabbling. The best way to go about it is to remove yourself mentally from the dramas, to the best of your ability at least. This is one of those times when you just have to let people figure things out for themselves.

"
28 december 2016,sagittarius,"You need to get real about your money situation and fortunately the cosmos intends to help you. A new moon tomorrow in your income and savings sector is the ticket to becoming more solvent in 2017. With Mars in your house of security, comfort and family you’ll be highly motivated to do so. And with Uranus going direct in your house of skills and talent, it’s time to polish them up so that they become more valuable.

"
29 december 2016,sagittarius,"Just in time for 2017: a new moon in your income sector, opening up several weeks of opportunity in which you can rally hustle. The energy of a new moon is strongest in the two weeks that follow it but extends out six months, so between  now and the end of June you can take a quantum leap in your career. Why wait til next week to get moving? Start researching your options now. With Uranus moving direct today you can really showcase your skills.

"
30 december 2016,sagittarius,"If you’ve been struggling with an endless battle between work demands and your family life, a solution may present itself. Yesterday’s new moon was in your income sector, so think differently about your occupation and how you might be able to switch things up in 2017 so that you’ll have more free time–not only for the people you love, but for yourself too.

"
31 december 2016,sagittarius,"Uranus is making you impatient to plunge into projects, especially the fun kind! But methodical Saturn tells you to slow down a bit. You’ll still be able to pursue what your heart yearns for, so have no fear. It’s just that right now you have to take care of more practical concerns. Once they’re out of the way you’ll have more time for enjoyment.

"
1 january 2017,capricorn,"With so much planetary action going down in your house of brilliant thinking and self-expression, 2017 is your year to shout it from the mountaintops! Shamelessly self promote yourself, go viral, write that book, socialize, and pull your art portfolio together. Just make sure that you’re working with a solid plan and not flying by the seat of your pants.

"
2 january 2017,capricorn,"Even a sturdy goat can run out of steam as it’s climbing the mountaintop, and it looks like it’s time for you to take a breather. With optimistic Jupiter in your house of ambition and success for the first time in over a decade, you’ve been working hard for months now. Despite the fact that 2017 just began and maybe you’re anxious to attack your resolutions, chill out a bit and rest up between now and Saturday.

"
3 january 2017,capricorn,"Over the next few weeks you’ll be able to sell ice cream to Eskimos, Capricorn, now that charismatic Venus has entered your communication sector. Not only is this an excellent time to connect on a deeper level with a lover, but the world in general. Any means that you have at your disposal to express yourself should be taken out, polished off and disseminated: your resume, buzz reel, a blog post that you want to go viral, your thesis or your art portfolio. This is no time to wait for recognition.

"
4 january 2017,capricorn,"One of the most powerful aspects of the year is coming your way on Saturday: the meeting of influential Pluto and the Sun. They hold a powwow in your sign, making this a breakthrough day for taking charge of your life. The smart Capricorn spends some quiet time this week in deep reflection beforehand, considering all of their options and the best strategy. When Mercury retrogrades into your secluded twelfth house today, it will provide you with the opportunity to think intelligently about the next twelve months and strategize accordingly.

"
5 january 2017,capricorn,"Of all the signs of the zodiac, you are probably the most driven to succeed right now, Capricorn. And there’s nothing wrong with that as long as you don’t lose sight of a few simple things. Like: joy, comfort, quality time, loved ones and nurturing yourself. An emotional Moon-Uranus convo today encourages you to find some time for them. Don’t view them as a “treat”, but as a necessity.

"
6 january 2017,capricorn,"Take out the trash! From your mind, that is. With Mercury retrograde until Sunday in the sector that governs your subconscious mind, it’s time to stop the pity parties and any other nonproductive activities going on in that brain of yours. It may not be easy, but with disciplined Saturn, the planet that helps us create good habits, in the same part of the sky you can make some serious progress.

"
7 january 2017,capricorn,"Look out world! There’s a new goat in town, and this one will have as much mojo as Moses parting the Red Sea. Capricorn, you are in one hot smokin’ situation today as the two most powerful orbs in the solar system, the Sun and Pluto, meet up in your sign. Talk about stepping into your power! It’s time to focus like a laser beam on what it is that you’d like to achieve and leave the trolls, naysayers and dramas of the past behind you. I almost pity whomever is foolish enough to get in your way. Your ability to influence others in a positive way will be there, along with a burning desire on your part to move ahead. Get going!

"
8 january 2017,capricorn,"Despite the fact that the Sun has been in your sign for weeks, dousing you with charisma and a can-do attitude, you still may have been in a bit of a funk. Mercury has been retrograde in your moody twelfth house of the subconscious mind, but say “hallelujah”, it goes direct today. Actually this interlude may have helped you recognize the negative thought patterns that you need to toss in 2017 in order to move ahead. Which you will, my friend, because Mercury enters Capricorn on Thursday!

"
9 january 2017,capricorn,"Someone could try to push your buttons today, Capricorn, but this person and their battle isn’t worth it. This vibe continues into Wednesday, so keep your mental focus on you, your work and the things that matter to you the most. You have so much positive energy going on in your house of thinking, writing and creative self-expression that it would a waste of your precious chi  to expend it on malcontents.

"
10 january 2017,capricorn,"Don’t tread on me! That’s going to be your motto over the next few days as people in your orbit may try to cajole, coerce or guilt you into doing things their way. Good luck. With two of the most powerful orbs in the solar system, Pluto and the Sun, together in your sign you won’t be suffering fools gladly. Just keep on doing your thing and let the malcontents stew on the sidelines.

"
11 january 2017,capricorn,"Your personal power is growing, Capricorn, and today a terrific Mars-Pluto aspect sharpens your intellect—and maybe your tongue too! But the other person looks like they have it coming. One of the problems with being a Cap is that people take your hard work ethic for granted, and today you may become aware of that. If someone needs to be put in their place, do so (diplomatically) without a speck of remorse. Any roadblocks that get in your way need to be removed right now, and that includes people with expectations that you owe them something.

"
12 january 2017,capricorn,"You might need to slow your roll as some key decisions must be made. Today’s full moon in Cancer is surrounded by a grand cross, which means that planets are tugging and pulling on each other. This will affect your ability to make wise choices; or, make you feel as though you can’t give all areas of your life the attention they deserve. It will be your needs versus a partner’s, your career and goals versus your family life and taking some downtime for yourself. Fortunately smart little Mercury zips into Capricorn today, helping illuminate the path ahead.

"
13 january 2017,capricorn,"With so much planetary firepower in recent weeks pushing you to go after your ambitions, you may have forgotten what it’s like to just have a good conversation with others.Take some time out this weekend to slow down a bit, have some fun and get some things off your mind. Share your ideas, whether it’s with a close friend or just a blank sheet of paper. There is wisdom inside of you–let it out.

"
14 january 2017,capricorn,"Ready to start cashing in on your hard effort? Recent planetary aspects have made you more driven than the other 11 signs, and no doubt you’ve been busy—probably too much so. Intelligent Mercury just entered your sign on Thursday, turning you into a pro at negotiating and putting on a dazzling self presentation. Get your ducks in a row, Capricorn, because the Sun enters your house of making mo’ money next week. There will be a new moon here on the 27th, kicking open doors. Between now and the end of July you should see more green in your wallet.

"
15 january 2017,capricorn,"Great minds produce great ideas, and your brain has been firing on all cylinders lately. The problem is that you may have become so mired in details and trying to figure out what to do next that you can’t see the big picture. The fog will clear by Wednesday at which time you’ll get a better handle on your plan of action.

"
16 january 2017,capricorn,"Tunnel vision? You may have been a victim of it over the past few weeks as the cosmos has been pushing you to achieve your goals. Which is OK, but your sign especially runs the risk of becoming so focused that you forget that there’s a great big world out there. Today a sparkling Moon-Pluto aspect reminds you to stop and smell the roses. Make some plans to travel, relax, hang with friends and enjoy life.

"
17 january 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to change your talk–not only what you say to others, but the self-talk that goes on in your mind. Being harsh on yourself or resorting to pity parties has no place in your life right now. As Buddha said, “What we think, we become.” So do you want to be more serene? Then take your thoughts to that place.

"
18 january 2017,capricorn,"Cha-ching! The Sun is just about to enter your house of making a lot more money on Thursday where it will remain for four weeks. The smart goat gets moving today with self-promotion, drawing up action plans, refining proposals and considering the way they present themselves. With look-at-me Mars in your house of self-expression, make sure that your appearance and attitude are up to snuff.

"
19 january 2017,capricorn,"Discretion is the greater part of valor, words that you would be wise to listen to today. Over the next week or so it’s critical to say as little as possible, especially via text, e-mail or on social media. Keep your opinions to yourself and protect your ideas as though they re precious gems—because they are  valuable. Some snarky Saturn energy suggests that there are malcontents in your midst, people who are word-twisters and idea stealers. They won’t be disappearing anytime soon, but as long as your lips are zipped you have nothing to fear.

"
20 january 2017,capricorn,"Gotta love it. The Sun is now in your prosperous second house, the place where we earn (and save!) mucho dinero. And one of your best assets is assertive Mars, blazing a path through the third house of thinking, strategizing, writing, lecturing, negotiating and self-promotion. The red planet will only be here till the 28th, so make haste.

"
21 january 2017,capricorn,"Need to make amends with a friend? Or perhaps they need to apologize to you. The lines of communication can open wide today with help from the cosmos. You’re in a situation in which you want more guarantees out of life, so flaky or unreliable pals aren’t acceptable, not to mention frenemies. Today, Sunday and Tuesday sparkle for holding meaningful conversations with others.

"
22 january 2017,capricorn,"Slow down and take a few steps back. That’s the message the cosmos has for you today, Capricorn, as the Moon has entered the most reflective part of your chart. Are you going about things the right way? Should you switch up your methods, whether it’s the way you try to communicate with someone, exercise, or market your company? With a new moon coming on Friday in the sector that deals with smart systems, a bit of thought now can pay off handsomely in the future.

"
23 january 2017,capricorn,"Keep your cards close to your vest! Your intuition may be right on target about a person or a situation, which certainly is helpful, but you may realize that someone has ulterior motives. Say nothing and remain vigilant. You won’t have to keep your opinions to yourself forever–just for now. Besides, sometimes you just need to let somebody’s karma catch up with them. Why tip them off?

"
24 january 2017,capricorn,"Got a message you want to share? Whether it’s a conversation with your kids, writing a book or kicking off a marketing campaign, the next few days are stellar for self-expression. It’s also a smart time to just sit back and do a lot of thinking. With the illuminating Sun, transformative Pluto and quick witted Mercury all in the sector that governs your self-image and the things that are closest to your heart, it’s a good time for reflection and reconsidering your plans for the future.

"
25 january 2017,capricorn,"This is a “wow!” of a Wednesday, Capricorn. A superb meet up of the passionate moon, metamorphic Pluto and quick witted Mercury will enable you to develop a better understanding of what makes you tick—which you can then use to your advantage. Some call this “enlightenment”, others call it common sense. Whatever. With so many planets in intelligent, action-taking sectors this additional insight will help you enormously in the weeks and months ahead.

"
26 january 2017,capricorn,"It’s crucial to remain realistic about your ambitions and plans, and today it’s advised that you slow down and think about them. Optimistic Jupiter is in your goals sector, which can possibly make you take on too many projects or have expectations that they will manifest faster than is possible. Venus, in your house of strategizing and thinking, will help you get real without it being a painful process! Mind you, these two planets govern profits among other things, so being pragmatic about money is key.

"
27 january 2017,capricorn,"Gotta love it when hard work finally pays off, and that’s what you’re going to witness over the next six months, Capricorn! A new moon in your income sector kicks open a new phase in which you can start seeing results from the things you’ve been working on. From your chart it appears that you may have been working on projects quietly, behind the scenes. Or maybe you’ve been listening to your own inner wisdom rather than the advice of others. If that’s the case you’re on the right track. Learning how to self-promote is one of the things you’ll need to finesse over the next few months, so pay attention to marketing and branding.

"
28 january 2017,capricorn,"You’ve been working pretty hard without much of a break since late 2016, Capricorn, and yesterday’s new moon in your income sector indicates that the pace isn’t going to let up any time soon. And today assertive Mars moves into your house of family and home, meaning that in addition to a heavy work load you may also have to shoulder responsibilities with the family unit. It’s also possible that you may decide to move, remodel or redecorate your place. A balancing act is going to be necessary, otherwise the weight of all of these tasks could grind you down, making you one cranky goat. Tomorrow is a good day for considering how to handle this.

"
29 january 2017,capricorn,"It’s time for a brief time out, Capricorn. The planets have been pushing you since mid-December to go after your aspirations and they’re not letting up, especially not with Friday’s new moon in your house of making a lot more money. But today it would be wise to take a few minutes to reassess the direction you’re heading in, no matter what your dreams might be. Pluto is asking you to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of a plan and make adjustments. Do that, then get back to the process of world domination.

"
30 january 2017,capricorn,"Just how much should you let on? Sometimes it’s wiser to say little and observe more. Today’s a good time to be as absorbent as a sponge. Your sign is known for being direct, but if you have  to say something you might want to cloak your words carefully. Does that include flattery and schmoozing? Hell, yeah! Just keep it to a minimum.

"
31 january 2017,capricorn,"Over the next two months your determination to create a more peaceful, contented life will increase, whatever that means to you: saving more money, feeling less stressed about work or family obligations, or creating a beautiful home as examples. But despite your best efforts, something or someone may get in the way today. Maybe it’s your own fears or concerns, or perhaps it’s resistance from others. Remember, your body and mind are a temple—treat them that way. Nothing should soil them.

"
1 february 2017,capricorn,"Too many tasks, not enough time. You may be the hardest working sign of the zodiac, always willing to take on more responsibility, but even a goat’s back can be broken from too much weight. Frustration is mounting about all of the undone things on your to-do list, causing stress. Chin up, Capricorn! Help is on the way come the 6th when Jupiter retrogrades in your house of ambition. The pace will slow down, your blood pressure will drop and you might actually be able to carve out time just for enjoyment.

"
2 february 2017,capricorn,"Your sign is known for following tradition, but the cosmos says that it’s time to bust out of an old familiar groove and jazz things up a bit. Luckily Mars is in your house of creativity, so there should be no shortage of fresh ideas coming your way. Yes, you have a lot on your plate, but doing things the same old way can make you feel like a hamster on a wheel. It’s time to start feeling like a peacock instead!

"
3 february 2017,capricorn,"Your emotional state is the focus of the cosmos this month, the aim being to heal and feel more serene. Fortunately, gentle Venus enters your house of contentment today for an unusually long stay. Start the healing process by thinking about past dramas, especially those from childhood or within your family now. Start letting them go as the lunar eclipse on the 10th is designed to exorcise fear, jealousy or resentment. You have places to go and new people to meet—who needs to drag any baggage along on the journey?

"
4 february 2017,capricorn,"With La Luna in the most high spirited part of your chart this weekend you, of all the signs, should be out there cutting loose. Flirt, party, shop, get a massage, dine well, and enjoy cultural pursuits and sporting events. This is just the appetizer of the main course, which is Jupiter going retrograde on Monday. Once the gas giant begins to back stroke you can slow down in your relentless pursuit of achievement.

"
5 february 2017,capricorn,"We all have habitual thought patterns. Some of them serve us well, others don’t. The cosmos is urging you to clear out confusion, denial and anything else that may be clouding your vision. Fortunately, pragmatic Mercury will be entering your second house of routines on Tuesday, which also governs dignity and self-esteem. It’s time to feel bigger than your circumstances.

"
6 february 2017,capricorn,"What appears to be a problem could actually be a benefit in disguise! Mighty and abundant Jupiter begins to back stroke in the heavens today, forcing you to slow down and examine all of your goals and ambitions. As long as you take the long view you’ll be fine, Capricorn, as this four-month retrograde period can help you zero in on the best way to get ahead. An added benefit is Mercury’s entry into Aquarius tomorrow, your second house of ritual, routine and making mo’ money. Study your habits and methods while you dig up new ways to add to your bottom line. Then get ready to see major progress in early June with all of your passion projects.

"
7 february 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to inject some feng shui into your life now that intelligent, organized Mercury has entered your house of simplicity and routines. Considering that Jupiter went retrograde yesterday in your ambition sector, the cosmos is telling you that maintaining solid daily habits is the way to go, rather than just focusing on the end game. Process is now more important than the grand finale.

"
8 february 2017,capricorn,"Powerhouse Pluto has been in your sign for some years now, challenging you to transform your life so that it resembles your ideal. Naturally this often requires an attitude adjustment on your part, which may not always be accepted by the people around you. If you need to pull away from certain folks or set bigger boundaries, do so. Tomorrow and Friday are excellent for establishing new rules, and restoring your dignity in the process.

"
9 february 2017,capricorn,"Contentment and happiness are not the same thing. Happiness tends to come with experiencing certain events–getting engaged, graduating from college–but it doesn’t always last. Contentment, on the other hand, is a deep seated sense of security, feeling at ease with your life today  for no apparent reason. The cosmos is helping you develop that sense of security in a series of aspects that will take place over the next three days. Pay attention.

"
10 february 2017,capricorn,"Sex and money! Want more of both—even just one? Well, you’re in luck, Capricorn. The ancients placed financial wealth in the same house as intimacy back in the day, and tonight there will be a sparkling lunar eclipse in this part of your chart. This could be a game changer as eclipses act quickly and often without warning, speeding up our plans and activities. As a result, a financial project that you’ve been working on could pick up steam, delivering a healthy payday your way. Matters of the heart can also gain momentum. Singles, you could fall fast and hard for a new flame and coupled goats could witness the beginning of a luscious new sexual chapter in their love life. There will be a number of eclipses in this sector all the way through 2019, so this is just the appetizer.

"
11 february 2017,capricorn,"Last night’s lunar eclipse fell in one of your money houses–the big  money sector. As in wealth. And fortunately for you, the illuminating Sun meets up today with profit-generating Jupiter, a highly auspicious aspect for making progress. This is no time for remaining in a dead end job or being passed over for promotions and higher pay. You don’t ask, you don’t get.

"
12 february 2017,capricorn,"Not sure how to get your message out there? Whether you’re trying to market your brand, impress a potential client, or convince a family member to see things a different way, you could be facing obstacles in the early part of the week. A Moon-Neptune opposition creates confusion, but not to worry. Once the powerful Sun enters Pisces next weekend the fog will lift and you will be able to communicate with ease.

"
13 february 2017,capricorn,"The cosmos has your brain firing on all cylinders and today you may be thinking about how to earn more money. This is a thought that won’t be going away soon as this energy lasts through the end of next week. You may need to switch up your vision of what you’d like to see happen, but this doesn’t mean settling. On the contrary, the planets are trying to create a far more secure situation for you.

"
14 february 2017,capricorn,"The sturdy goat has been working its little tail off as of late, and as a result you may be too worn out for grand gestures on Valentine’s Day! But pull yourself together and get a little romance going. Of all the signs of the zodiac, you have the most planets in stable, secure houses when it comes to love. You won’t be looking for someone to merely party with. This is serious soulmate territory, so make sure that you’re involved with someone who fits that bill.

"
15 february 2017,capricorn,"In your never ending quest to make headway up that mountain (or that career ladder), Capricorn, don’t forget to stop and smell the roses. Mars, now in your cozy house of domesticity, is pushing you to take some much-deserved down time for yourself and your loved ones. You’re about to enter a very social period so tear yourself away from your to-do list, at least for a little while.

"
16 february 2017,capricorn,"Adding more structure to your daily life is advised by the cosmos, especially at home base. If your routine is streamlined there, and your environment is organized and conducive to peace, this will carry with you as you go about your day. Make the effort to get as pulled together as possible.

"
17 february 2017,capricorn,"A true friendship is based on mutual respect, among other things, so if an acquaintance isn’t being kind to you you may need to pull away for a bit. Jackie Kennedy was famous for giving malcontents the cold shoulder rather than reaming them out, so a pal may need to feel a distinct “chill in the air” if they’ve been difficult. With so much planetary activity in your house of dignity, make sure that you maintain yours.

"
18 february 2017,capricorn,"Put your money where your mouth is! The Sun has been in your income sector for the past four weeks, helping you come up with ideas for making more money. Now that it has moved on your quick thinking and smooth talking house of communication, you can start talking turkey. Schedule job interviews, ask for a raise, make presentations to bankers and clients, and research new income streams. Next week is stellar for making progress.

"
19 february 2017,capricorn,"The week ahead is super for talking turkey, so start planning today how you can make (and save) more money. Then hit the ground running on Monday with your ideas, whether that means lining up interviews or quietly researching an entrepreneurial idea that’s been bubbling in your head. Next week’s solar eclipse is a terrific opportunity to self-promote; get your marketing materials and your pitch ready.

"
20 february 2017,capricorn,"The planets are aiming to bring you peace of mind, Capricorn, whatever that means to you. For some it’s financial relief, for others it’s an improvement in their health. The smartest thing you can do right now is to review your habits and routines and see where you can improve them. Taking ownership of your own serenity is what it’s all about.

"
21 february 2017,capricorn,"Your ability to take a step back and analyze your plans with a cool, objective eye will take you much further than you may realize, Capricorn. You may feel as though you’re losing valuable time by taking a more measured approach but according to the cosmos, it’s the smart way to go right now. Keep this in mind tomorrow when a tense Mars-Pluto square could stir up your more ego-driven side.

"
22 february 2017,capricorn,"Take it easy there, Capricorn. Someone may get in your face and try to get you to do things their way, and chances are you’ll rebel. Or is it you who’s stomping your feet and demanding action? It won’t work so don’t even try. Your goal today is to be non-judgmental and just focus on your own little world.

"
23 february 2017,capricorn,"It’s always smart to seek advice from experts, but sometimes your own inner wisdom is the best source of all. Mature, stable Saturn is active in the house of the subconscious mind, helping you to create a life that’s truly yours. A greater sense of dignity and self-confidence are on the way, provided you pay attention to what your gut is telling you.

"
24 february 2017,capricorn,"There’s nothing wrong with following your material desires as long as you (a) don’t go broke in the process and (b) the things you purchase add to a sense of comfort and beauty. We’re not talking about over-the-top retail therapy here; rather, creating a beautiful home environment that makes you feel serene and happy. Venus is in your domestic sector, encouraging you to live well within your budget.

"
25 february 2017,capricorn,"Now that clever Mercury is in your house or brainstorming, you’ll have no shortage of bright ideas. The problem is that you may have too many, so select the ones that really float your boat. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse in the same sector is the perfect time to launch them.

"
26 february 2017,capricorn,"OK, Capricorn, it’s decision time. Get off the fence and do some of those things you’ve been thinking about doing. Today’s solar eclipse in your house of self-expression tells you to write that book, go back to school, learn Photoshop, get serious about a social media campaign or strategize with savvy experts. There is a strong social vibe here; the more people you speak with, the better informed you’ll be.

"
27 february 2017,capricorn,"The ancient Taoists believed that “home” was your own inner world, a place of calm and peace that you took everywhere. That no matter where you were, you were “home”–that is, if you had learned how to be centered and in the flow. That’s a concept you’ll need to consider today as the two most stubborn and hot-headed planets–Mars and Uranus–meet up in your house of home. From your chart it appears that you need to get back in touch with that inner place of contentment.

"
28 february 2017,capricorn,"A battle is brewing in your brain as one part says, “Keep pushing forward!” while the other just wants to plop on the couch and watch Netflix. You’re not a perpetual motion machine, Capricorn. Even long-life batteries need to be recharged. Not to mention that you’re probably overthinking things, thanks to the recent solar eclipse in your mental third house. Carve out more down time for yourself.

"
1 march 2017,capricorn,"Vision boards, affirmations, positive thinking—all of these traditional self-help techniques may sound a bit….foreign to you, Capricorn! You’re a practical soul, and a traditional one at that. You may therefore have a hard time letting go and doing some creative visualization. But the cosmos urges you to let go of the old ways of doing things and try some new techniques. Don’t worry—you’re still going to work hard. No other sign recognizes the value of well-placed effort better than yours.

"
2 march 2017,capricorn,"Feeling a little cranky, Capricorn? That will definitely happen when you don’t set aside enough time for yourself. A difficult opposition today between Jupiter and Uranus, the first of its kind in 14 years, is lighting a fire inside of you to take better care of #1. All work and no play is making for one extremely burned out goat. The trick is to continue pursuing your ambitions while taking the time to stop and smell the flowers.

"
3 march 2017,capricorn,"Make a vow to spend some time on the more enjoyable things in life. A happy Moon-Pluto connection asks you to live life with more creativity and artistry. Pluto is the planet of metamorphosis and it’s in your house of culture, hobbies, sports and having fun—by yourself and with other people. You need to smile more often.

"
4 march 2017,capricorn,"Touchy, touchy! The mighty goat might start looking like a prickly cactus tree over the next month, thanks to Venus retrograding. Your emotions could be raw as people push your buttons. Likewise, old memories (especially family ones) may come bubbling to the surface, bringing unresolved feelings with them. Your security within a romantic relationship may also feel threatened. The question is: are there really problems there, or are you being ultra sensitive? Think before you emote.

"
5 march 2017,capricorn,"Simplify. If there was ever a time to “feng shui” your life it’s right now, Capricorn. From your chart is appears that your mind needs to destress. One of the best ways to do that is to live in a less cluttered home, be involved in fewer activities and make peace of mind not an option.

"
6 march 2017,capricorn,"Your brain is on fire this week, Capricorn! Brilliant ideas abound. Today rocks with a super Sun-Mercury meet up, so use it to your advantage. You can also multitask, chat people up and get your message out there on social media and regular marketing channels.

"
7 march 2017,capricorn,"Am I right, or am I right? Your gut feelings about someone’s behavior or agenda is on target, Capricorn. This may cause unease, especially if it’s a close connection. With Venus retrograde, though, you may be more sensitive than usual. As the week progresses the lines of communication open and you should be able to say what’s on your mind. If they don’t want to listen, then that’s their issue.

"
8 march 2017,capricorn,"If there was ever a time for “rebranding” yourself, it’s now, Capricorn. This term is usually associated with people who own their own business, but the cosmos urges all  goats to rethink their self-image. It’s not only the clothes you wear or your hairstyle, but the way you think and speak, not to mention what you do for a living and the people you associate with. The full moon on the 12th kicks open many doors—get ready to walk through them.

"
9 march 2017,capricorn,"Ready for romance? Juicier, more amorous escapades could be coming your way now that Mars is in your house of love. This sector also governs having fun, getting in touch with your artistic side, and enjoying sports. It’s about time, Capricorn. You’ve been working your little tail off. Recharge your batteries and savor the sweeter side of life.

"
10 march 2017,capricorn,"Should you be channeling your energy and passion in a different direction? With so much planetary activity in your mental third house, it wouldn’t be surprising if you are thinking this way. And you’re smart to do so. Sunday’s full moon falls in the most open-minded part of your chart. Consider new options in all areas of your life, from love to career to hobbies.

"
11 march 2017,capricorn,"“Drama reduction” is the goal today, Capricorn! People around you may be looking for your advice, but it’s one thing to lend an ear and another to let their crazy circumstances disrupt your day—or serenity. The same holds true for romance. If your partner is hell bent on creating a scene, let them know in no uncertain terms that you don’t appreciate it.

"
12 march 2017,capricorn,"It’s blue skies ahead, Capricorn! A happy full moon in your creative, adventurous ninth house encourages you to take a cherished idea and run with it—no matter what other people think. Pluto is in an excellent angle from your first house, the place where we kick off important new cycles and express our individuality. But with Saturn hiding in your hush-hush zone, you may want to keep your ideas private for now.

"
13 march 2017,capricorn,"You have one foot on terra firma, the other one in the heavens. Conflicting planetary aspects find you both mentally grounded and sailing away into lands unknown. But this is a good thing, Capricorn–it gives you the chance to think on a grand scale without taking undue risk. Mercury’s entry into your solid fourth house will enable you to challenge the status quo and keep it real.

"
14 march 2017,capricorn,"If you want to achieve anything of value in your life, you’ll have to get out of your current comfort level. A super-charged Moon-Jupiter aspect encourages you to go after some big dreams—but why are you putting up mental resistance? Some tense aspects indicate that you may be holding back. We all have issues that need to be resolved—take care of them and surge forward.

"
15 march 2017,capricorn,"An excellent balance of discipline, creativity, optimism and hard work all combine today to make whatever you’re working on a success. Whether you’re a stay at home mom, a student or a CEO, you have the ability to pull together all of the facets of a project and make them shine.

"
16 march 2017,capricorn,"Your dreams may get a jolt today, Capricorn! I’m not referring to your night time escapades but the ones that occur during the day. Inspirational Neptune is active, stirring up your imagination and creative juices. However, stern Saturn may be throwing a bucket of water on them, saying, “Really?” That’s OK. All dreams should get a reality check before they are acted upon.

"
17 march 2017,capricorn,"With the Sun and Neptune both in your house of thinking, strategizing and communicating, you’re in a darn good spot to express yourself. But should you reveal everything that’s going on in your mind? Probably not! Stern Saturn in your house of secrecy warns to be circumspect about how much you divulge. Whether it’s a business plan, an idea for a screenplay or novel, or a social adventure, keep a lot of the juicy details to yourself.

"
18 march 2017,capricorn,"Your home should be your castle, and if it’s not, this is a good weekend to change that. Perhaps some redecorating is in order. Maybe you need to move—to another place nearby, or another state. If family members are disrupting the harmony at home this is an excellent time to smooth things over. But there’s no need to rush—once the Sun enters Aries on Monday you’ll have a complete month to get things done.

"
19 march 2017,capricorn,"It’s one thing to be involved with other people, be they loved ones or colleagues, and another thing to be controlled by them. If your moods or thoughts are constantly focused on the latest drama created by someone else, or their incessant needs, you need to create some boundaries. Peace of mind is not impossible. It may take some effort, but the planets are urging you to make that your #1 aspiration right now.

"
20 march 2017,capricorn,"Spring officially begins today north of the equator, which means…spring cleaning! Of all the signs you’ll be the most motivated to turn your home into a castle, thanks to the Sun’s entry into Aries. Considering a real estate purchase or a move? This will be on the table over the next four weeks, along with resolving domestic disputes. Just don’t forget to take some down time and relax at home too. You need the break!

"
21 march 2017,capricorn,"Why are you doubting yourself, Capricorn? You may be fearful that things won’t change, or that you don’t have the chops to pull off a major coup. But you do have what it takes. From your chart it appears that you are pushing against previously set boundaries, otherwise known as going out of your comfort zone. Yes, change is uncomfortable—but the results are worth it.

"
22 march 2017,capricorn,"Securing your future is on the planets’ agenda today, especially your financial security. Real estate, retirement accounts, mutual funds or a job that you’re not fearful about losing are all important. With the great transformer, Pluto, in your house of self, your opinion as to what matters may be changing. The next few days could bring confusion, but by Sunday the fog lifts.

"
23 march 2017,capricorn,"You will be in no mood today for dealing with people who slack, make ridiculous demands or become way too emotional. Powerful Pluto in your house of self-esteem is making you rather intolerant these days, so you have to watch the tendency on your  part to become way too emo! This vibe continues into Friday but starts to dissipate over the weekend. Ahh—sweet relief.

"
24 march 2017,capricorn,"Uh, you may  want to control any tendency to boss people around today as a Jupiter-Mercury smackdown indicates that it will backfire. You could be 100% right about something, but that doesn’t mean that others will get that fact. People around you may be so entrenched in doing things their way that they could be bossy too. If you’re at the receiving end of someone in diva mode, just back away and let them rant.

"
25 march 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to start paying attention to some of the sweeter parts of life, such as relaxing and enjoying the company of people you love—which includes you! With a happy meeting of the Sun and Venus this weekend, carve out some quality time for chilling at home with pals, kids, a lover or just yourself. The good news is that this isn’t a “limited time offer” just for the next 48 hours; it’s a trend that will last for the next few months. You’re such a hard worker that you may actually need to book fun time into your schedule. Whatever works!

"
26 march 2017,capricorn,"You are long overdue for some socializing, Capricorn, and the planets want to change that. With energetic Mars in your romance sector, love can heat up quite nicely (and this includes new liaisons). Chatting with neighbors, brunching with friends and inviting people over to your place are all good ways to let your hair down. Yes, you could use some alone time, but not today. Mingle instead.

"
27 march 2017,capricorn,"You’re on a creative roll right now, so let your talents shine. Energetic Mars is ratcheting up your skill level in a big way. And dreamy Neptune, planet of inspiration, is active in the thinking and speaking sector. You can use this positive energy in any way you please–to redecorate your home, hold a meaningful conversation with a child or lover, or impress the boss with a knockout proposal.

"
28 march 2017,capricorn,"Your emotional and physical comfort are in the cosmos’s crosshairs these days, Capricorn, and today’s new moon is designed to help you become more settled. Take an inventory of your life and figure out what needs to be remedied in order to feel more content and at ease: more sleep? a less cluttered home? more time spent in nature? less sugar, caffeine or alcohol? more quality time with family and friends? a daily meditation practice? Then start taking action tomorrow, when a helpful Mercury-Pluto trine will allow you to create better habits—and stick to them.

"
29 march 2017,capricorn,"If you need to close out a part of your emotional life that’s no longer working for you, Capricorn, today’s a good time to start. This isn’t so much about ending relationships as it is about getting rid of toxic thoughts and feelings. Saturn, planet of maturity and stability, has been cruising through the house of the subconscious mind for over two years, performing one heck of a detox. Between now and December you have the opportunity to cleanse your soul and move on.

"
30 march 2017,capricorn,"It may be time for a readjustment when it comes to your career goals, or maybe just your sense of personal power. A Jupiter-Pluto square may find you questioning what’s next in your life. Are you on the right path? Do you need to pull away from certain people who may be trying to hold you back? Once Mercury moves into Taurus tomorrow you’ll want to live a more authentic life.

"
31 march 2017,capricorn,"Of all the signs, you deserve to let your hair down and relax a bit, Capricorn. When the Sun moves into Taurus on April 19th you can really get into a far more chilled out groove, but why not start the party now—even just a little bit? Mercury zips into your fifth house of fun, the place where we stop and smell the roses. And wine, dine, flirt, indulge in hobbies, date, absorb culture, play, and treat ourselves to luxe goodies. The weekend is upon us. Get out there and have some fun!

"
1 april 2017,capricorn,"Who has time for love? The ever striving goat may feel as though romance is a luxury, something for another day some time in the future. Well, that’s not how it works, Capricorn, and now that energetic Mercury is in your fifth house of romance it’s time to add some amorous mojo into your existence. This vibe will only increase as April continues, so get ready to flirt, turn heads and spend some quality time with a lover.

"
2 april 2017,capricorn,"Tell it like it is! Between now and the 15th it’s crucial to be as direct as possible. That’s because Venus is now retro in your communications sector, which could lead to mixed messages and the confused emotions that follow. Between now and the 15th strive to be clear and concise. The full moon next week on Tuesday will lend you an air of authority that others will notice. use it to your advantage.

"
3 april 2017,capricorn,"People around you may be tugging on your shirt sleeve, demanding attention or favors that you may not want to give. Be polite and listen to what they have to say, but don’t feel as though you are obligated to bend to their wishes. This includes neighbors and friends as well as family members and co-workers. By the way, this vibe continues into next week. At the time of the full moon next Tuesday you may have to put your foot down.

"
4 april 2017,capricorn,"Loved ones may be intent on getting you to do things their way, Capricorn, and it could rile you. You have no problem when it comes to being helpful or a team player, but enough is enough. This vibe isn’t going away any time soon either, so get used to setting boundaries. With next week’s full moon arriving in your house of ambition you can’t slow down your pace in order to rescue people who are capable of helping themselves.

"
5 april 2017,capricorn,"You know what you want, so why aren’t you asking for it? Be more verbal about your plans, demands and ideas. Don’t overshare with people who don’t deserve the full scoop, but you can open up with those people who can open doors for you.

"
6 april 2017,capricorn,"If there was ever a time in your life to exorcise negative thoughts, emotions and memories, it’s now. Saturn has been traveling through the house of your subconscious mind for over two years, something that it hasn’t done since 1985! The ringed planet goes retrograde today, urging you to do a lot of inner work between now and September. Next year Saturn will be in Capricorn and all eyes will be on you. Make sure that you’re mentally ready for one of the most transformative periods of your existence.

"
7 april 2017,capricorn,"The planets warn against being a Type A workaholic, Capricorn! I know that this is like talking to a wall as your sign is known for its work ethic. But the energy of the Sun collides with Jupiter’s today, creating a situation in which you must  create more balance in your life. Whether you’re single or have a family there needs to be more quality time for the simple pleasures of life.

"
8 april 2017,capricorn,"Good fences make for good neighbors, as the saying goes. And boundaries (real or imagined) are often needed with our family members. Be wary of people close by who are looking for someone to bail them out, or constantly need a shoulder to cry on. Two tough aspects today warn against being too open-hearted. Unfortunately there are those who will take your generosity and use it to their own advantage. Will they be there for you though if you need help?

"
9 april 2017,capricorn,"Now that Mercury is retrograding through your fifth house of romance, you’ll need to keep a cool head about you. Drama, arguments, misunderstandings and the hurt feelings that accompany them could be on the menu from now until the 20th. Oh, and did I mention that exes are known to return during this kind of transit? Egads. If it’s of any comfort to you Tuesday’s full moon is in your house of authority. Wield it.

"
10 april 2017,capricorn,"If you feel that right now is the best time to get moving with a particular decision or plan, then go for it. The full moon tomorrow in your success sector is pushing you to wrap up the past and move on to the next stage of your life. But Pluto in your sign may be holding you back with a lot of “Yes, but”s. If you’re nervous about making changes take baby steps instead of a big leap.

"
11 april 2017,capricorn,"The heavens usher in the annual full moon in the most ambitious part of your chart, a welcome event as it will reward you for months of hard work, not to mention opening up new doors. A radical shift may take place in your career or overall plans for the future. Your intuition is as strong as the logical part of your brains so use both to your advantage. Just beware of pushing yourself too hard–and pushing others over the edge with your ambition!

"
12 april 2017,capricorn,"If you need to make amends with someone today’s a smart time to do so. With charming Neptune in your communication sector you can get your point across with ease. Try to wrap up convos before Friday, when erratic Uranus could bring about a more combustible set of circumstances.

"
13 april 2017,capricorn,"You have your heart set on doing something that will change your world, something big and exciting. The Moon in Scorpio will help you not only dream, but to see to it that your ideas are in line with your values. The recent full moon kicks open doors that may have been firmly shut. Start walking through them.

"
14 april 2017,capricorn,"A sudden urge to change a situation that you may have been locked into could arise today, Capricorn! Spontaneous Uranus is acting up in your fourth house, which deals with comfort and security. Busting out of an old groove could become an obsession: moving to another part of the country, for example, or chucking the day job. Perhaps you quickly decide to move in with your boyfriend, or say sayonara to a safe-but-boring lifestyle. Carpe diem.

"
15 april 2017,capricorn,"Lines of communication open and smooth out as magnetic Venus resumes direct motion in your chatty third house. This is especially helpful in matters of the heart. With the Sun entering your romance sector next Wednesday, it’s time to be on the same wavelength as your lover–or with a potential candidate for your love.

"
16 april 2017,capricorn,"If someone close offers you advice or throws a piece of information your way, pay attention to what they have to say. You tend to follow your own wisdom most of the time but sometimes it helps to get a second opinion, or to get a different viewpoint. New doors will be opening up for you within the next few weeks, so it’s smart to have your head on straight beforehand.

"
17 april 2017,capricorn,"The say that your body should be treated like a temple, but what about your mind? The planets are encouraging you to indulge in some extreme self care when it comes to your mindset. A positive and healing Sun-Saturn aspect will bring about the wisdom you need to find contentment and peace. You may have to do a lot of inner work but it will be worth it.

"
18 april 2017,capricorn,"A battle is brewing inside your mind, Capricorn, as you grapple with fears, repetitive negative thought patterns and concerns about whether you’re on the right track or not. Powerhouse Pluto is scheduled to retrograde on Thursday in your sign, opening up a five month period of reflection and metamorphosis. You won’t be the same person at the end of September that you are now; you will be far more confident and serene.

"
19 april 2017,capricorn,"Experiencing more joie de vivre is what it’s all about over the next four weeks, Capricorn! The Sun has just entered your fifth house of fun, romance and culture, telling you to stop working so damn hard. Not that you’ll pay attention, with aggressive Mars moving into your efficiency sector this Friday. But for heavens’ sakes, would you please pencil in some down time once a week?

"
20 april 2017,capricorn,"You need a break, Capricorn, and the cosmos is officially putting you on “bed rest”. Sort of. With Pluto retrograding today in your sign, and Mercury doing the same in your house of self-nurturing, it’s time to slow down and lighten up your schedule. While you won’t be spending days in bed you should  be looking for ways to make your life less stressed. And if that means pulling away from people who bring too much drama and discomfort into your life so be it. You need to recharge your batteries.

"
21 april 2017,capricorn,"Work that body! Energetic Mars enters your health and fitness sector for the first time in two years, lighting a fire under you to live a cleaner and more vibrant lifestyle. It doesn’t hurt that Pluto went retrograde yesterday in your sign. Pluto is the planet that will pinpoint weaknesses in our habits and lives so that we can fix them, and it often requires a complete overhaul. But like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, you can morph into a fitter, happier version of yourself. Now drop to the floor and give me 20 pushups.

"
22 april 2017,capricorn,"This is not a good day to wear your heart on your sleeve, nor is it wise to reveal too much information of any kind! A difficult Venus-Saturn square recommends that you keep your cards close to your vest. Knowledge is power, and the more information you keep hidden the better off you’ll be.

"
23 april 2017,capricorn,"You can sell ice cream to Eskimos today as gentle Venus puts the right words in your mouth, Capricorn. If you need to persuade anyone to come around to your viewpoint this is the time to go for it. Self promotion and social media campaigns are also favored, as are expressing yourself beautifully in writing (think manuscript or screenplay) and artistically.

"
24 april 2017,capricorn,"Decluttering your home always is helpful in feeling less stressed, but sometimes you just have to declutter your mind. If it’s too full of random thoughts, things that you’re annoyed about, and the demands that other people are placing on you, it’s time to relieve the burden. (And I’m not talking about doing so with vodka or sedatives.) Start this process now, my friend. The new moon on Wednesday falls in the most life-affirming, fun parts of your chart. You need to unwind first.

"
25 april 2017,capricorn,"Seems like it’s time for some mental feng shui, Capricorn. Your emotional state is the cosmos’s focus as planets are lining up in one of the most comfort-driven parts of your chart. Sober Saturn has been in the house of your subconscious mind for over two years now, helping you heal. But today you can take a quantum leap forward as Uranus encourages you to try new modalities. If previous methods for mental healing haven’t worked, seek out new ones that will.

"
26 april 2017,capricorn,"Feeling romantic? You should be with a new moon occurring in the most amorous part of your chart. But there’s a strong nesting vibe here, suggesting that you won’t be looking for dubious flings or partners who can’t go the distance—as in, all the way to the altar. Already committed goats are recommended to start spending more time at home alone with your lover and family. This lunation will spark your creative side as well, so get ready to dazzle at the workplace.

"
27 april 2017,capricorn,"Current planetary activity is encouraging you to live a more authentic life, which means getting off the career treadmill, if just for a few hours a week! You may just feel like collapsing on the couch and binge watching Netflix, but that’s not what the cosmos has in mind. Take a day off and go window shopping, visit a museum and enjoy a leisurely lunch at a cafe. Sign up for watercolor classes. Curl up with a good book and a cup of tea. Be good to yourself, and open your mind to the culture that’s all around you.

"
28 april 2017,capricorn,"The cosmos dishes up some interesting aspects your way, Capricorn. The recent new moon fell in your house of enjoying life and getting out more.

Either way, you’ll be far more relaxed and at ease than you have been in recent months.

"
29 april 2017,capricorn,"“Mind like water” is an Eastern philosophy, one that many of us would like to achieve: serenity and contentment in the midst of the usual daily chaos. Saturn has been in the house of your subconscious mind for two years now, trying to bring you greater peace. But it won’t happen unless you start letting some of your work stress go first. You have to start somewhere.

"
30 april 2017,capricorn,"Connecting with others become easier with a happy Sun-Moon aspect. El Sol is currently in your house of creativity, so think about new and more constructive ways of communicating with others. This can be verbally, of course, but also consider your writing skills and any artistic skills that might be getting a little rusty.

"
1 may 2017,capricorn,"Despite your best intentions to be a team player others may be unpredictable today, ranging from outright cranky to sullen and passive aggressive. Who cares? With so much planetary energy building up your self esteem and feelings of contentment, you might let their negativity roll off of you like water down a duck’s back. And that’s  progress!

"
2 may 2017,capricorn,"The planets are in a practical mood and you’re a practical soul, so the energy on offer this week is perfect for you. Today it’s advised that you take a good long look at your finances and get them in order. Know how much debt you have and how you plan to pay it down. Consider what steps you can take to increase your net worth. When Mercury goes direct tomorrow, saving for a home or home and family-related expenses will be front and center.

3 may 2017,capricorn,"Thank your lucky stars, Mercury goes direct in your family zone. If siblings, kids, parents, roommates or a spouse have been a pain in the tush, things should start to ease up. A sparkling Sun-Neptune aspect today bodes well for improving relationships with kids and siblings especially. The next few weeks are also terrific for decorating as your creativity soars, thanks to the Sun in your artistic zone.

"
4 may 2017,capricorn,"Don’t rest on your laurels, Capricorn. You may feel like slacking off a little bit and heavens knows you would deserve to do so. But you have momentum going in certain parts of your life that you would be wise to maintain, if not increase. The passionate Moon is encouraging you to take a few intelligent risks and get out of your comfort zone. With the Sun blazing  a path through the most creative part of your chart it would be foolish to not it everything that you’ve got.

"
5 may 2017,capricorn,"Regardless as to what you do for a living, you should be injecting more passion and flair into your daily efforts. The mighty Sun is in your sector of artistry, telling you to approach all areas of your life with more zest. “But I’ve got a soul-sucking job that I can’t stand”, you might say. Oh really? Then now is the perfect time to research your options. Even if you can’t afford to quit the day job you can start something worthwhile on the side. What are you waiting for?

"
6 may 2017,capricorn,"Pushing past your current comfort zone is what it’s all about over the next week, but this can create feelings of discomfort. Stern Saturn may be stirring up fears and concerns, and you could end up today thinking that you’re better off staying just where you are. But that all changes tomorrow as the Moon meets up with abundant Jupiter, sparking more optimism.

"
7 may 2017,capricorn,"It’s the weekend but your mind is on success as the passionate Moon meets up with abundant Jupiter in the most ambitious part of your chart. Better yet is that inspirational Neptune is in fine form too, so carve out an hour to do some strategizing. Consider how partnering with others might advance your plans, as Wednesday’s full moon falls in your collaboration sector. A coach or a mentor is a smart option to pursue.

"
8 may 2017,capricorn,"Family members and loved ones might be pushing your buttons, Capricorn, and emotions may get heated. You’re willing to work with people but not be run over by them, so if anyone needs to be put in their place you could do so between now and Wednesday. Tomorrow is the best day to talk things over with kids or a lover, so wait until then before you cut loose.

"
9 may 2017,capricorn,"Today is a winner on a number of different levels, Capricorn! Pluto is telling you to own your personal power, not to be afraid to show the world who you are and what you think. And the Sun is in a fabulous spot from your creativity sector, which is like pouring gasoline on a fire. It’s time to take a more creative approach to life, expressing your individuality through everything you do—the way you dress, talk, and decorate your home; the dishes you prepare; the vacations you take; and your choice of occupation. Approach your life as an artist would.

"
10 may 2017,capricorn,"If you’ve been working hard on a group effort or online project, the long hours and toil may finally start to pay off, Capricorn. The full moon tonight in Scorpio falls in the tech and teamwork part of your chart. This may only be a resting place, a time to congratulate yourself for a job well done before moving on to the next level, but momentum is building. This is also a super time to launch a venture, whether you’re planning a family reunion or an online shop. Your creative juices are running high thanks to the Sun in the most artistic part of your chart, and with powerful Pluto in a good angle you are definitely stepping into a more influential role.

"
11 may 2017,capricorn,"Looking for love? Want to inject more passion and excitement into an existing union? Then today’s happy Sun-Pluto aspect will help you get your groove back. From your chart it appears that you are going to be the one who makes this happen, so don’t sit around and wait for your partner to plan that three-day getaway to the romantic B&B in the countryside. Singles, you’re in a superb spot to meet a long time love, someone with depth. But all goats should be looking of more ways to inject some fun into their lives, not just romance. You desperately need some down time.

"
12 may 2017,capricorn,"Got goals? Then you’ll be happier than a pig in mud today as the most motivated planet in the solar system, Mars, reaches out to abundant Jupiter. You can’t go wrong with this pairing, no sirree. It’s an excellent time to launch new initiatives, make progress with existing ones, and to impress muckety-mucks with your perseverance and brilliance. It’s a great time to try a new technique, hack, routine or to look at something from a fresh perspective

"
13 may 2017,capricorn,"The planets are in a mood to help you manifest what’s important to you, and today their lesson is all about mental clarity. A meeting of the Moon and Saturn will help you get rid of worries, fears and other obstacles that may be in your way, which may include toxic people. It’s imperative to get the “junk out of the trunk”, so to speak, because the Sun is driving up your creativity. In order to let your brilliance shine forth you have to clean out the dark, dusty cobwebs in your mind.

"
14 may 2017,capricorn,"You’ve got the chops to get things done, a realization that’s finally starting to hit you. The question is: do you need to rub other people’s noses in that fact? Sometimes the best way to wield strength or to make progress with a plan is to say as little as possible. What people don’t know will work in your favor.

"
15 may 2017,capricorn,"The term “power trip” usually brings up negative connotations of people with big egos trying to show off and push others around. But you’re on a different kind of power trip, thanks to Pluto’s potent activity in your sign. This is about quietly assuming an inner strength that is unshakeable, regardless as to what’s going on around you. And it comes from learning to love yourself, just as much as you would love another.

"
16 may 2017,capricorn,"The cosmos is dishing up a few contradictory aspects for you this week, Capricorn. Today Mercury enters your fifth house of having more fun, enjoying romance, spending quality time with your kids and really digging into hobbies or art. No problem there, right? But on Saturday the Sun pops into your ultra-efficient sixth house, which means: balancing checkbooks, cleaning out junk drawers and closets and catching up on your to-do list both at home and at work. It’s definitely a glam versus utilitarian battle here. My advice: don’t let the to-do list win. Find a way to balance both.

"
17 may 2017,capricorn,"Your brain may be crackling with some pretty interesting ideas, and once the Sun moves into Gemini this weekend you’ll have the chance to act on them. For today, though, consider the kinds of habits and systems you’d need to have in place in order for them to succeed. Furthermore, who do you need on your team? To mentor you? In business, who is your ideal customer or client? Lay the groundwork now.

"
18 may 2017,capricorn,"Sometimes you need to take a few steps back before you can move forward, and that’s what the cosmos suggests for you today. With abundant Jupiter in your house of ambition and success for the first time in over a decade, you are no doubt highly motivated to make big changes. The problem is that you may have too many good ideas, or you’re working so diligently that you’re failing to see the overall picture. Slow down, think about where you’re heading and the most efficient way to get there. Once the Sun rolls into Gemini on Saturday you’ll be unstoppable.

"
19 may 2017,capricorn,"Serious Saturn has been cruising through the house of your subconscious mind for two years now, trying to help you release negative patterns and people. But that kind of change usually isn’t easy, nor is it fast. Well say “hallelujah”, because today Saturn forms a rare aspect with spontaneous Uranus in which closure and healing can take place quickly. These two orbs will be traveling in an excellent, tight angle over the next six months, so get out of any pity parties and move on. You’ll be glad that you did.

"
20 may 2017,capricorn,"First the good news: the Sun has just entered the most efficient, organized part of your chart. Over the next four weeks you can blast through chores and to-do lists like a champ. Now for the funky stuff: there could be some hidden resistance to your efforts. It could come in the form of a malcontent at the office, a family member who’s determined to be difficult or a frenemy. But it could also be the little demons in your own mind that hold you up. You know: procrastination, fear of success, bad habits or systems, negative thought loops that keep spinning around and so on. Figure out where the problem lies and take care of it, stat. Red hot Mars is also in this part of the sky, so you should be unstoppable.

"
21 may 2017,capricorn,"Now that the Sun is in the most efficient part of your chart you should be feeling more motivated to get all of the parts of your life together, from your diet to balancing checkbooks to being caught up with work at the office. Today the Moon is in your domestic sector, so this is the perfect time to get organized at home. You probably won’t be able to accomplish everything in one day, but hey, you gotta start somewhere.

"
22 may 2017,capricorn,"Need some personal space? With Venus in the most warm, fuzzy and security conscious parts of your chart, clinginess could become an issue this week: either you’re latching on to someone or they’re so far up your tuckus that you can’t sit down. This could reach critical mass by Thursday, so my advice is to try to work things out today. Venus is in a conciliatory mood, so talks should go well.

"
23 may 2017,capricorn,"Boundaries. We often need to set them with other people, but sometimes we need to set them with ourselves. What are you willing to tolerate in your life, and what is simply not acceptable to you? Some people call them rules, others call them standards. Either way you’re going to have to make some big decisions over the next week as to what your limits are.

"
24 may 2017,capricorn,"With tomorrow’s new moon occurring in your house of getting things done, you won’t be in the mood for anyone or anything that might slow you down over the next few months. So take a little time today to chill out, whether it’s with a lover, pals or by yourself. The people closest to you may not see you as much as they’d like in the near future; make them happy now!

"
25 may 2017,capricorn,"Get with the program. It’s time to cut out people, situations or systems that aren’t productive. This isn’t heartless: it’s necessary. Today’s new moon in the most efficient part of your chart demands that you streamline in order to live a happier, more stress free life. People may cling and claw, not wanting to be cut out from your existence. Or, they want to keep their head trips and dramas going. Unfortunately for them, you’re in no mood to deal with it. Keep moving forward.

"
26 may 2017,capricorn,"Calling all shamans! The cosmos has quite the spiritual vibe for you today, so get in touch with your inner self. Reiki, meditation, prayer, walks in nature—all of these can help you make that all-important connection. Don’t be surprised if you experience an “aha!” moment as spontaneous Uranus is in a helpful spot.

"
27 may 2017,capricorn,"Here’s the good news: with aggressive Mars in your house of wellness you could become incredibly motivated to get fit and rid yourself of aches and pains. Now for the downside: in your impatience you might overdo it, get impatient with yourself and your results, and possibly injure yourself. Slow down the pace a little and give your body time to catch up and heal.

"
28 may 2017,capricorn,"Getting your message out to the world becomes a heck of a lot easier these days as inspirational Neptune is placing the right words in your mouth—or your pen-or your keyboard! It’s a stellar time to develop your brand, complete a thesis or put the finishing flourishes on a creative project.

"
29 may 2017,capricorn,"Sometimes we can be our own worst enemy when it comes to making progress in our lives. We go on diets and then fall off the wagon; we ruminate over things that might happen in the future but in reality, rarely do; habits are hard to break ; and we allow too much drama into our lives, whether we create it or others do it for us. Well, mature Saturn has had enough of this, thank you very much, and says that it’s time to snap out of it. Quit blaming others and take a look at yourself.

"
30 may 2017,capricorn,"Taking better care of yourself becomes a priority today with a happy and productive Mars-Uranus meet up. With Mars in your house of fitness and vitality for the first time in two years, you should be highly motivated to make smart changes. But Uranus wants you to also nurture your psyche, so remove yourself from draining situations and people.

"
31 may 2017,capricorn,"You know what you want, but how do you go about getting it? Fortunately for you smart little Mercury is in the most innovative part of your chart, stirring up your creative juices. Consider new avenues and techniques, then get ready to make things happen.

"
1 june 2017,capricorn,"You’ll need to balance your needs against those of others as it appears that people around you may be making demands on your time–and your patience. Gently let them know that although you’re there to help, that you can only do so much. The reality is that they need to take ownership of their own problems, and setting some boundaries on your part may actually help them realize that.

"
1 june 2016,capricorn,"Take a deep breath and count to ten. The Sun in your house of productivity just wants you to get your job done, whether it’s the food shopping or returning e-mails at work. But Neptune is throwing up resistance. The key to finessing this energy is to keep your mouth shut! You run the risk of saying something you shouldn’t. Be very careful what you put in writing as well. Neptune is known for creating confusion, and the next few days are going to test your patience.

"
2 june 2017,capricorn,"Your confidence gets a big boost as optimistic Jupiter is happily situated in your ambition and success sector. You’re on the verge of stepping into a more self-assured place, and a lot of this simply comes down to the nitty gritty. Gaining control over your schedule and your habits will help you take your ideas and make them real. Think about what you can achieve in the next 90 days–then go for it!

"
2 june 2016,capricorn,"Seems like the little goat has been playing it too conservatively for the cosmos’ taste. Honey, it’s time to bust out of an old self-image and lifestyle and enjoy a more creative existence! So book an appointment at the hair salon for a new do, plan a trip to some crazy far-off location that no one would ever picture you visiting, and dig those watercolor and oil paints out of the closet. We’re the only species on the planet that can create works of art. We also can choose to live inside the box…or on the fringe! Push those boundaries.

"
3 june 2017,capricorn,"A sudden desire to revamp your home life, romance, career and  your figure may seem to come out of nowhere, but it’s the cosmos at work. Luxe Venus, planet of beauty (and big bucks too I might add) is winking at let’s-just-do-this-already Uranus. So if your motivation level skyrockets over the next few days, you’ll know why. With the approaching full moon in your house of closure, you should be more than ready to move on to a much higher level of living. Bon voyage!

"
4 june 2017,capricorn,"Teaming up with others is the way to go now that Mars has entered your partnering sector for the first time since 2015. On the romance front, Venus is just about to enter your house of flirting and fun, which bodes well for singles as well as couples. And your career can get a big boost by collaborating with others, whether it’s a standard business partner or an expert whom you retain to push your interests forward. Consider an accountability partner too if you’re starting a new workout regimen or trying to break a habit.

"
5 june 2017,capricorn,"Drowning in paperwork? Overwhelmed by all of the items on your to-do list? Feel like a hamster on a wheel, never able to get to the things that really excite you? We all go through it, Capricorn, but your sign is feeling it the most right now. That’s because the Sun is squaring confusing Neptune, which may find you at a loss as to which task you should start next. The good news is that clarity starts to seep in as of tomorrow when practical Mercury enters your house of efficiency. Until then, just do the best you can.

"
6 june 2017,capricorn,"A flirty, more festive time has arrived thanks to luxe Venus shimmying into your fifth house of fun, romance and creativity! Not only can you find a new lover or spend more quality time with your amour, you can simply slow down a bit and smell the roses. And the Pinot Grigio…and the latte…and the Chanel #5. It’s time for a bit of pampering as you freshen up your look. Some new designer clothes, perhaps? Think Cinderella, fairy godmothers and balls at the palace to get you in the right mindset.

"
7 june 2017,capricorn,"You’re in a bit of an odd spot, Capricorn. The Sun has been in your go-go-go sector of efficiency, and Mercury heads there today too. But other planets warn that you need to slow your roll a bit. After all, what’s the point in tearing through tasks if you’re not really focused on them? Mistakes will be made, and they usually cost time and money. Revise your methods. Being constantly busy doesn’t mean that you’re actually getting somewhere.

"
8 june 2017,capricorn,"The manner in which you communicate with others in the workplace could use an update, Capricorn. This isn’t so much about day-to-day chitchat but the way you present your ideas to bosses, clients and colleagues. Contracts, brochures, your website, brand, Powerpoint presentations, sales and marketing methods: all of these need to be tweaked. Considering that Jupiter is just about to go direct in your ambition sector, it’s time to rethink the overall image you present to the world.

"
9 june 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to put an end to situations that are way  past their sell-by date, Capricorn! Tonight’s full moon falls in the house of closure, so out with the old and in with the new. If you want to view this as your own personal New Year’s Eve in June, so be it. Toss out bad habits, old ways of doing business, holding a torch for an ex (why? why?), frenemies, a crummy diet, and anything else that you recognize as dead weight. Then start searching for more powerful and constructive ways of getting things done.

"
10 june 2017,capricorn,"Woo-hoo! Generous Jupiter has resumed direct motion in your house of ambition and success after a four-month nap. If progress with any of your major goals was slow (even nonexistent), that’s about to change. Naturally things won’t happen unless you get involved, but with disciplined Saturn in a good angle you should be off and running. Intelligent, strategic Mercury is in your house of efficiency, so all of the stars are lining up to help you effect change.

"
11 june 2017,capricorn,"You’re seeking stability in all areas of your life, and now is the time to quietly figure out how to obtain it. Fortunately a number of planets are in your logical, left brain type houses, which is super for clarity. Ruminate today and start taking action on Tuesday.

"
12 june 2017,capricorn,"Big plans and goals get a boost as the most abundant and optimistic planet in the solar system, Jupiter, is in fine form. It’s not only a good time to make an impression on decision makers, you can also step into your own personal power. Over the next few months people will be viewing you as more of an authority, so get ready for your close up.

"
13 june 2017,capricorn,"Feel like you’re getting the runaround? This is most likely today from co-workers or customer service people. You also need to check out the fine print on contracts for any “weasel words”, statements that are too vague or enable someone to slither away from a commitment. Due diligence, baby. It may be a hassle but you’ll be happy that you did it.

"
14 june 2017,capricorn,"Need to develop better habits and routines? Now’s a good time to start with the motivating Moon in your house of stability and rituals. Accountability starts with you, so get your act together before you expect others to do so. You will  be delegating tasks to others in the weeks ahead, but right now it’s all about your own level of efficiency.

"
15 june 2017,capricorn,"If you feel as though you’re pulling away from other people, don’t be surprised. Mature Saturn is active in your house of seclusion and introspection, and today the ringed planet is determined to shut out noise from the outside world. Pay attention to your own inner wisdom than the opinions of others. This will be especially true over the next five months when Neptune begins to retrograde tomorrow.

"
16 june 2017,capricorn,"Dust off the handy BS meter: you’re going to need it. Murky Neptune retrogrades in your communication sector, indicating that people in your world could be handing you a truckload of manure. Over the next five months you’ll need to second guess what people are saying and thinking. And make sure that you’re as crystal clear as can be, because this murkiness can cloak you in a fog of mixed signals. You may feel indecisive, but don’t let that translate into wishy-washy behavior on your part.

"
17 june 2017,capricorn,"With the mighty Sun and shrewd Mercury in your house of efficiency, you’re definitely in a place of wanting to get things done. Problem is, your brain seems to be the consistency of scrambled eggs these days. It could be burnout, it could be stress, or maybe you’ve taken on too may responsibilities. You need to quiet your mind before you tackle anything new.

"
18 june 2017,capricorn,"A sudden urge to get the loose ends of your daily grind pulled together may hit you today Capricorn, and to quote Martha Stewart, “it’s a good thing.” Unfinished tasks and sloppy systems can create more stress than you realize, so now’s the time to make some changes.

"
19 june 2017,capricorn,"Turn up your radar, Capricorn. Someone in your circle, most likely at the office, doesn’t have your back and may be working at cross purposes to you. Listen, you may already know who this is and chances are this won’t faze you too much. But say as little as possible–and observe a lot.

"
20 june 2017,capricorn,"A positive solution to a problem could come today out of the blue, and it will bring a sigh of relief. This has more to do with your mindset and sense of internal peace than anything else. So even if people around you are acting up or circumstances are crazy, you should enter the eye of the hurricane—and stay there.

"
21 june 2017,capricorn,"The independent goat may start to consider bonding with others in the weeks ahead. That’s because strategic Mercury has entered your partnership zone along with his buddy the Sun. Oh, and don’t be surprised if you become more interested too in developing a stronger romantic relationship! That’s in the stars as well, and that includes you singles.

"
22 june 2017,capricorn,"Having someone in your corner to run ideas past is advised, now that the partnership zone of your chart is lit up. At the end of 2017 you will be entering one of the most amazing periods of your life, an event that hasn’t happened in 30 years: Saturn enters Capricorn. Spend the next six months getting ready.

"
23 june 2017,capricorn,"From your chart it appears that you need to get real about your closest relationships. It’s time to protect your own interests, which may sound selfish but it’s absolutely necessary. Pay attention to your gut–it won’t steer you in the wrong direction. Assess who’s on your side and who’s not.

"
24 june 2017,capricorn,"A passionate period begins, one that just doesn’t include romance. The new moon in Cancer kicks off a six-month chapter in which you can make progress in love: finding someone new, getting engaged or taking an existing relationship to a deeper level. But it’s also a terrific time to pour your passion into hobbies and creative pursuits that put a smile on your face. Passion isn’t just about love: it can be a way of approaching life.

"
25 june 2017,capricorn,"Your desire to be a good little Capricorn and be charming and diplomatic with everyone is wearing thin today, and you will continue to feel like this on and off over the next week. With inspirational Neptune in a good spot from your communication sector, you can easily speak your mind–but why bother if others are going to be difficult? Choose your battles–or the people you connect with–wisely.

"
26 june 2017,capricorn,"Inspiration may strike when you least expect it, and this week could be full of inspirational moments. That’s because mind-broadening Neptune is in your mental third house, stirring up thoughts that you can take and run with. But your best bet is to collaborate with others, so don’t play lone wolf–and least not for the next three to four weeks.

"
26 june 2016,capricorn,"Don’t hide your light under a bushel! A rare trine between Pluto and Jupiter could put you in the spotlight in a big way. Jupiter is in the part of the sky that deals with the news media, publishing, and gaining recognition. If you have been confused about the path ahead, today’s trine could point you in the right direction. No matter what, you won’t be thinking small. This aspect won’t happen again until 2024, so make the most of it.

"
27 june 2017,capricorn,"If you need to persuade people around you to work together more closely, today’s planetary aspects have your back. This has been–and will continue to be–a bumpy week when it comes to gaining cooperation from others. Push for teamwork over the next 48 hours, because by Friday people will be in a funk again!

"
27 june 2016,capricorn,"Sweet love! The two planets of amour, Neptune and Venus, form the best possible angle possible—a trine. Neptune is in your house of discussions, telling you to speak your mind with your amour. It’s an excellent time to clear the air so that the two of you can move on. Single and looking? The cosmos has your back. Your best chance for finding new love is via a friend, considering that Mars is active today in your house of acquaintances. Or is that platonic friend of yours looking hot all of a sudden?

"
28 june 2017,capricorn,"Strong-as-an-ox Pluto has been really pushing you lately to take charge of your life, and you may be feeling like a lone renegade as a result. But a Mars-Mercury aspect suggests that two heads are better than one, and that you can travel down your path more quickly if you have company. Don’t view people as extra baggage—they can actually help you along the way.

"
28 june 2016,capricorn,"Stay where you are, or move on? Planetary aspects indicate that you may be facing a quandary as to which path to take. Whether it’s a family matter, business opportunity or romance, you seem to be resisting some form of change. Your sense of security is at stake here, but lucky Jupiter encourages you to take a risk.

"
29 june 2017,capricorn,"A strong independent streak may be building inside of you; the desire to go it alone. This doesn’t mean that you’re going to break off relationships with others but you will  be more determined than usual to follow your own agenda. Just don’t ram it down someone else’s throat. This is one instance in which discretion is the best strategy.

"
29 june 2016,capricorn,"Pluto is back stroking through your first house of self, asking you to analyze the various parts of your life that you think need to be changed. For some goats, a little tweak may be needed here and there; others may be considering a total overhaul! Whatever it is that needs to be changed, the recent full moon has made it clear that some “house cleaning” needs to be done, metaphorically speaking. Today you may get hit with a sudden dose of inspiration. Work with it; honor it.

"
30 june 2017,capricorn,"To thine own self be true? A planetary battle is brewing as Mars an Pluto are inching closer to a face off in the heavens. In your case, Capricorn, the issue will be your needs and goals versus those of others. Fortunately the Moon will help you take care of both in a diplomatic and generous manner.

"
30 june 2016,capricorn,"With two full moons in a row in the most sensitive part of your chart, you’ve been releasing people, situations, habits and thought patterns that aren’t working for you anymore. In addition, powerhouse Pluto in your house of self is determined to dismantle weakness in the foundation of your life, even if that means using a wrecking ball. While you  may be feeling more upbeat as these changes take place, not everyone around you is. Today’s Pluto-Venus opposition will make that apparent. Roll with it.

"
1 july 2017,capricorn,"It may be the start of a holiday weekend in the US but your mind will still be on your biggest aspirations. And this is a good thing, as inspirational Neptune is helping you to consider new ways of going about them. Once Venus changes signs on the 4th practicality will be the name of the game, so get ready to select the very best projects to go after.

"
2 july 2017,capricorn,"How much you want to share with others, and just how much you want them to know about your life is going to be recurring theme this week. A powerful struggle today between Mars and Pluto could encourage you to go off the grid, so to speak. Face it, not everyone is entitled to the juicy details of your life and the plans you’re making. Be discrete.

"
2 july 2016,capricorn,"Hmmm….got a secret agenda? There’s quite a hush-hush vibe at play in your romance sector, as the Sun forms an interesting angle with Saturn in your house of confidentiality. Perhaps you’re keeping your thoughts to yourself, or you’re not quite ready to move on to the next step with your amour. That’s OK. Monday’s new moon in this part of your chart opens up a six month period in which you can make some big decisions.

"
3 july 2017,capricorn,"You’ve been on somewhat of an independent streak lately, but today’s happy lunar activity suggests that you reach out to friends and loved ones. This isn’t just for socializing, by the way. Someone in your circle may mention something that inspires you or makes you feel more grounded.

"
3 july 2016,capricorn,"Energy is building in your romantic sector, as tomorrow’s new moon falls in this part of the sky. Today the Sun embraces amorous Neptune in your communication sector, telling you that it’s time to have a serious talk with your beloved about where your relationship is going. They form a trine, the most glorious angle possible. Singles, this is a superb time to meet someone new! And all Capricorns may discover that someone may want to form a business alliance with them in the months to come.

"
4 july 2017,capricorn,"Some major shifts are about to happen as the upcoming full moon on Saturday helps you get crystal clear about what you want to do next in your life. This lunation occurs in Capricorn, so it will be all about establishing new cycles. Fortunately Venus enters your ultra-efficient sixth house today, making it easy to find the right hacks and habits to make things happen.

Serious Saturn is in a strong position, promising longevity for the union. But you may need to keep your relationship or plans quiet for a while. Neptune in your communication sector will enable you to hold productive discussions!

"
5 july 2017,capricorn,"A match made in the heavens: intelligent Mercury has just entered your fact-finding, laser-focused eighth house. Whether you want to figure out how to boost your company’s profits or figure out what’s going on in your lover’s head, you are now in super sleuth mode. No need to steal their phone and snoop their texts. Intuition and an analytical mind are all you need.

"
5 july 2016,capricorn,"If things have been confusing—or even questionable—in a romantic relationship, today is perfect for getting to the bottom of the matter. Foggy Neptune has been retrograde in your communication sector, but planetary aspects today help clear some of the mist away.

"
6 july 2017,capricorn,"“If you want things done the right way, you just have to do them yourself.” That may be your mindset these days as lovers and colleagues seem to either slack or be somehow unwilling to do their share. But this won’t deter you. With Saturday’s full moon occurring in your sign, you may actually be better off doing things your way!

"
6 july 2016,capricorn,"Feel like getting hitched? You could be thinking about that today, as the cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, embrace in the heavens. It’s all about serious commitment, so singles, be out there looking! The action is taking place in your house of partnerships, so it’s possible too that someone may be interested in working with you over the next six months in some kind of business venture.

"
7 july 2017,capricorn,"Talking things over is far better than letting them fester inside of you. True, tomorrow’s full moon is in Capricorn, so you may be quite focused on yourself these days. And true, you may not really be depending on others all that much lately to get things done. But holding in resentment or annoyance will slow you down….and who needs that?

"
7 july 2016,capricorn,"Pluto is in your house of self, challenging you to grow and stretch past your boundaries. Today this little powerhouse opposes planets in your partnership sector, creating potential friction between you and a romantic or business alliance. There could also be flak coming from parents or a family member, so you’ll need to really think about your needs versus those of the people around you.

"
8 july 2017,capricorn,"It’s all about you, Capricorn! Tonight’s full moon occurs in your sign, and it could represent a turning point. Some major projects that you may have started around the time of your birthday could come to pass, a source of great satisfaction. And as one chapter wraps up another one begins. Don’t be surprised if you suddenly change direction: maverick Uranus is acting up, pointing out new possibilities to you.

"
8 july 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes it’s wise to go it alone in life, and other times it’s better to team up with others who share your world view. Today is when the latter applies. If someone shows interest in working with you (or romancing you!), consider what they have to say and what they have to offer. You may find that you end up traveling down a path that you had never considered, but with lucky Jupiter involved, you can’t go wrong.

"
9 july 2017,capricorn,"There’s no point in arguing with people who don’t see things your way. You know the old saying: you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink. Yesterday’s full moon was in your sign; push forward with your agenda and make things happen. It could take a lot of time before they come around, so don’t wait.

"
9 july 2016,capricorn,"Keeping an open mind should be easier with today’s Moon-Jupiter meet up in the most optimistic part of your chart.

With logical Saturn in your house of intuition, your gut will also help you figure out what’s going on in someone else’s head.

"
10 july 2017,capricorn,"There is no “I” in the word “team”….which is perfectly fine with you! A Sun-Pluto opposition today will make you determined to follow your own path and play by your rules. This energy will continue over the next two weeks, so don’t be surprised if you pull away from the madding crowd and work quietly on your own activities.

"
10 july 2016,capricorn,"Collaborative efforts are strongly favored by the cosmos, as the Sun and Mercury in your partnership area form magnificent angles with Mars and Jupiter. You may view yourself as the Lone Ranger in love or business, but the planets have other plans for you. In their wisdom they know that our lives are made far richer by associating with others who our soulmates, friends and colleagues. Reach out to like-minded people, as they are your ticket to a bigger future.

"
11 july 2017,capricorn,"Sometimes it pays to break the rules or shake things up in order to get ahead, but today is not one of those times. The traditional, tried-and-true methods will work the best. Remember this if you’re trying to impress a decision maker.

"
11 july 2016,capricorn,"Someone close could go into full diva mode and it may take you by surprise. With Mercury in your conciliatory partnership zone, you will no doubt be the one taking the high road in this situation. But will the other party? You can only do so much. If someone wants to play the role of martyr there’s not much you can do.

"
12 july 2017,capricorn,"The recent full moon in your sign has no doubt inspired you to look after your own best interests, and bravo if you are! There’s no point in hiding your opinions either, and with the Moon now in the most expressive part of your chart you should speak up. This includes blogging, teaching, writing and social media. You never know whose attention you might catch.

"
12 july 2016,capricorn,"The ancients placed sex and money in the same house, the eighth. They also considered Venus to be the planet of love and profits. Guess what, Capricorn? Lucky Venus enters your eighth house today, taking the term “getting lucky” to a much higher level! While things could become quite steamy in the boudoir, you could also score some wins when it comes to your financial strategy. The eighth house deals with passive income rather than salary, so spend the next few weeks brainstorming ways to make money on the side. When you’re taking a breather from intimacy, that is!

"
13 july 2017,capricorn,"You’re in a good spot, Capricorn. The recent full moon was in your sign, highlighting your ideas, dreams and kicking off brand new cycles. Today watery Neptune douses you with inspiration, so get ready for some intriguing ideas to flow into your mind.

"
13 july 2016,capricorn,"As the full moon in Capricorn on the 19th draws near, you should be getting ready to kick off a brand new cycle in your life. And with Mercury’s entry into your fiscal eighth house today, it’s prime time for considering wealth. The eighth house is big bucks, my friend, not small change. Mercury is the planet of buying, selling, negotiating and closing deals. Use its clever energy to add more cash to your bottom line.

"
14 july 2017,capricorn,"Here’s the good news: abundant Jupiter is super active today in your ambition sector. But the flip side of this is that you may be going in too many directions, attracted to “shiny things” here and there. Fortunately logical, strategic Mercury is in your house of laser-like focus. Use it to narrow down your options.

"
14 july 2016,capricorn,"Balancing act. That’s what is necessary as the demands of the outside world seem to be infringing on your personal needs. You need time for your family, loved ones and yes, yourself. This may hit you like a bolt of lightning under today’s planetary influences, so consider how you can create more quality time while still maintaining your other responsibilities.

"
15 july 2017,capricorn,"It’s crucial to communicate with others–and to be diplomatic about it too! You may be so hell bent on pursuing your own agenda that you forget that you’ll need the help of others along the way. They’re not mind readers, so let them know what you’re thinking and planning.

"
15 july 2016,capricorn,"Discipline. The word can bring fear, shame or admiration from us mere mortals when we hear the word! Contrary to popular thought, discipline is not a genetic trait that you inherit, but a skill that can be developed. And Saturn, the planet of self-control and longevity, is by your side today. Start by getting rid of the “junk in your trunk”–your emotional baggage, that is. With next week’s full moon in your sign, you don’t want anything holding you back.

"
16 july 2017,capricorn,"You may be determined to get to the bottom of something, but that doesn’t mean that others are willing to spill what they know or what they’re up to. Likewise, cooperation from people around you could be limited. That’s OK–stop worrying about the agendas of other people and focus on your own.

"
16 july 2016,capricorn,"“If you want my body, and you think I’m sexy, come on sugar, let me know.” Paging Rod Stewart, circa 1978! Oh yeah, you’ve got the goods, Capricorn, so get out there and strut your stuff. A smokin’ conjunction between glam girl Venus and tell-it-like-it-is Mercury in your sexuality sector makes you the talk of the town. Work it.

"
17 july 2017,capricorn,"Nitpicking will get you nowhere today, so avoid the temptation to dissect everything as you search for hidden answers, flaws or the perfect solution. Otherwise you’re going to end up with paralysis via analysis.

"
17 july 2016,capricorn,"With the approaching full moon in Capricorn on Tuesday, it’s time to wrap up issues and matters that need to be completed. The Moon is now in your twelfth house, the place where we trim the dead wood from our lives and take out the mental trash, metaphorically speaking. It forms a super angle with Uranus in your house of comfort and ease. The message? Close the door to the past and open up a new one. You won’t be taking the past with you as you move ahead.

"
18 july 2017,capricorn,"Creating more structure through better habits will pay off in spades, Capricorn. You’re known as the hardest working sign of the zodiac but that doesn’t mean that all of your routines are productive. Working smart is better than working hard.

"
18 july 2016,capricorn,"Who are you, really? And who do you want to become? With tomorrow’s full moon approaching in your first house of self-image and goals, you might be considering these kinds of thoughts. Metamorphic Pluto is standing in the wings, holding a deep conversation with the Moon today about your future prospects. The message? Let go of what’s weak, outdated, and no longer serving you. This could be anything from your habits to people and situations that don’t reflect the true you. One door is about to close…and a new one is about to open.

"
19 july 2016,capricorn,"Yee-ha! Kick up your heels, Capricorn. Today’s full moon is in your  sign. That means that it’s all about you—your dreams, your plans, your self-image and esteem. This is the cosmos’s annual gift to you, kind of like New Year’s Eve in the middle of the year. So pour yourself a cocktail or some matcha and let your daydreams run wild as you plan the next six months of your life. One word of note: Uranus is kicking up dust, perhaps making you nervous about security. Do you have the guts to make changes and let the chips fall where they may?

"
20 july 2017,capricorn,"Got something important to say to someone? Do it now, as two of the most mature and logical planets in the solar system, Mercury and Saturn, are well aspected. Hot headed Mars will be entering a quite emotional part of your chart tomorrow, so if you wait drama could ensue.

"
21 july 2017,capricorn,"Just how much drama do you want in your life, Capricorn? With the Sun about to join Mars in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, you can have plenty. Problem is, there are people around you now who can bring you the negative kind. It’s your life: choose the fun, juicy kind of drama over the soap opera variety.

"
21 july 2016,capricorn,"The moon in Aquarius is leading you down a particular path. It’s the path to making mo’ money. But in order to reach your destination, you need to examine your values and expectations about the green stuff. Do you just want a “little cushion” to cover you if times get tough? Are you settling for whatever the boss doles out, because the idea of going after bigger money scares you? If that’s the case, mighty Jupiter is telling you to dream big. Time for an attitude adjustment!

"
22 july 2017,capricorn,"You’re a focused creature to begin with, Capricorn, but now you’re going to be laser sharp. The Sun has just joined Mars in a sector that allows you to dig deep into anything: your finances, psyche, emotions and love life for starters. The same holds true for any business ideas that you have. Get ready for some intense research!

"
22 july 2016,capricorn,"Now that the Sun is in Leo, you’re going to be focused on stability–financial and emotional. While El Sol will be in this part of your chart for the next four weeks, you need to wrap up any home-related issues first: obtaining a mortgage, finding a place to live, going after past child support or settling family disputes. Uranus is scheduled to go retrograde in your house of residential matters on the 29th, which could throw a monkey wrench into your plans.

"
23 july 2017,capricorn,"The Leo new moon in one of the houses that governs your thoughts and emotions can help you get rid of tired, useless (and maybe even harmful) patterns that may be holding you back. Problem is, you seem to be holding on to them as if they were a security blanket. Just because they’ve been a part of your life for years doesn’t mean they should stick around!

"
23 july 2016,capricorn,"Neptune is known as the artist’s muse, and today it’s bringing out the best in you. Whether you’re simply picking out a new duvet cover, planning your garden beds, or creating the next Great American Novel, inspiration will flow.

"
24 july 2016,capricorn,"Need to have a heart to heart talk with a lover or family member? A helpful Moon-Sun trine lets you shine some light on matters that need to be clarified. With the recent full moon in your sign, you have a lot to accomplish in the weeks ahead. Try to straighten out as much as you can this week with the people closest to you.

"
25 july 2017,capricorn,"The good news is that you should be extremely focused, thanks to planets in your penetrating eighth house. the bad news is that this can cause paralysis by analysis. Fortunately, energetic Mercury zips into your optimistic house of taking chances, helping to break up a logjam.

"
25 july 2016,capricorn,"You’re getting antsy, Capricorn. Tired of living life the same old way and ready to bust out of old roles and situations that are stale. You will feel this keenly today as Pluto, the great transformer, squares the emotional Moon. Over the next five months you’re going to be taking more risks, ready to give up some security for exciting new changes.

"
26 july 2017,capricorn,"You’re not going to settle for life’s table scraps, that’s for sure–not with a dynamic Sun-Mars conjunction! You want the very best when it comes to love and money, and honey, you’re going to go for it. The next four weeks are perfect for researching your financial options and figuring out what you want out of romance. Then–on August 21st, it’s showtime!

"
26 july 2016,capricorn,"They say that practice makes perfect, but so does passion. The Moon is urging you to spend more time on the activities (and with the people) that make your heart sing. All work and no play will turn you into a dull goat. If you want to show the world the best you, light some fires inside first.

"
27 july 2017,capricorn,"Some inner struggles that may have been sidelining you start to ease up, thanks to the Moon entering the most authoritative part of your chart. Working through our own issues can be draining sometimes, but from your chart it looks like you are turning a corner.

"
27 july 2016,capricorn,"An idea or opportunity to increase your financial strength could come your way, and if it does it would be wise to act upon it. The planets are working to ensure your emotional sense of well-being and security. The recent full moon in your sign may have brought about an epiphany of sorts in which you realized that doing things the same old way just ain’t workin’. No problem; inspiration is coming your way.

"
28 july 2016,capricorn,"With the Moon in Taurus opposing Mars, you may wonder if some of your hopes and wishes are ever going to materialize. This has been a theme running through your chart for awhile now, but it’s about to end. When Mars changes signs on August 2nd, things will start to move forward. Slowly at first, but then momentum builds.

"
29 july 2017,capricorn,"Fortunately you’re not the type who needs someone else’s approval as you follow your life’s path. If someone isn’t supporting you, realize that it’s more about them than it is about you. Keep moving forward.

"
29 july 2016,capricorn,"Should I stay or should I go? Erratic Uranus is now retrograde in your domestic sector for the next five months, and it will make you question whether you should relocate or stay put. Before you pick up and move to a new locale, give it plenty of thought, as this planet creates an on-again, off-again vibe. Relationships with family members could get wonky too as some might get lazy, wishy-washy or stubborn. With power broker Pluto in Capricorn, you won’t let them get off easily with their behavior.

"
30 july 2017,capricorn,"A healthy body is a sexy body, and a confident one too. Glam Venus encourages you to turn your body into a temple with more nutritious foods, better sleep and a daily workout. Besides, with so much planetary activity in your libido sector these days you could use the energy!

"
30 july 2016,capricorn,"When the two most profitable planets in the solar system are holding a meeting about expansion and then shake hands, it’s time to pay attention! Because that’s exactly what’s happening today in your house of partnerships. Even if you’ve never previously considered joining forces with another person in order to further your ambitions, think about it. It could be a life coach, social media expert or image consultant, not necessarily a standard business partner. Keep an open mind.

"
31 july 2017,capricorn,"New relationships are coming your way, and existing ones get a reboot now that Venus is in your partnership sector. This is good news in both your romantic life as well as your business one.

"
31 july 2016,capricorn,"Pluto is trying to transform the way you look at the world, which includes the way you look at yourself and your relationships with others. Being straightforward (even blunt) may be your MO, but others may not be able to handle the unvarnished truth right now. Water down your words. Sometimes you just have to let other people figure things out on their own.

"
1 august 2017,capricorn,"You appear to need some quiet time, but that doesn’t necessarily mean spending hours alone. Find someone who makes your heart sing, someone who knows and loves you best–then tuck yourselves away for some good conversation and time well spent.

You might even experience an epiphany which helps you close out old dramas quickly and move on with confidence.

"
2 august 2017,capricorn,"Sometimes you just have to commit to a particular course of action, especially when it comes to your mind. Decide today to stop smoking, vow to rid yourself of negative thought loops, set aside the time for a spiritual practice. No more dabbling–make it real.

"
2 august 2016,capricorn,"Fresh opportunities to increase your net worth can come your way over the next six months, thanks to the new moon in your house of fiscal activity. This is big money, more than salary, and could come in the form of a windfall, inheritance, or the chance to invest in an exciting venture. However, with Mars entering your house of secrecy the same day, you would be wise to keep your ideas and plans under wraps.

"
3 august 2017,capricorn,"There’ s nothing like dysfunctional family members to make you feel as though insanity may be running in your DNA, right? Well darling, you’re going to have to be the sane one over the next five months now that erratic Uranus has gone retrograde in your family sector. Even if your relatives are rather normal, you’ll need to watch out for being thin skinned and moody as this aspect can stir up old emotions.

"
3 august 2016,capricorn,"With Venus scheduled to move out of your partnership sector this Friday, it would be wise to make a decision now about where a business or romantic relationship is heading. Fortunately, planetary aspects are excellent for discussing the big picture and your future plans.

"
4 august 2017,capricorn,"Sometimes we rebel against other people, institutions and society—other times we just rebel against ourselves. If you’ve been pushing yourself too hard, or have been going through a lot emotionally, a voice inside may be yelling “Enough is enough!” Stop being your own slave driver, or your own worst critic. Slow down, do less and pamper yourself more.

"
4 august 2016,capricorn,"Recent planetary activity may have you feeling restless and unsure as to how to handle people in your circle, as well as your future plans. Some of this stems from the Moon and Venus entering Virgo, stirring up your desire for independence and living a more vibrant lifestyle. If others are holding you back, trying to keep you in the small little “box” they’ve gotten used to seeing you in, it may be time to cut some cords.

"
5 august 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to sort out your thoughts and get clear about the kind of person you want to be inside. Yes, we’re talking about inner work here, but there won’t be a lot of drama and time spent on a therapist’s couch.

Give ’em a fighting chance.

"
6 august 2017,capricorn,"With the Moon about to leave your sign, you may be wondering when it’s going to be your turn to enjoy some of the finer things in life, like a juicier romance or a big fat payday.

"
7 august 2017,capricorn,"Yeah, baby! A sizzling lunar eclipse in your house of income helps you wrap up financial negotiations and job hunts. Then it does you the favor of kicking open a new door, one that leads to some serious coin over the next six months. You’ll have to put in the hustle but with aggressive Mars in your house of wealth (the higher octave of the income sector) you should be able to crush it.

"
7 august 2016,capricorn,"The Libra Moon is firing up some excellent ideas that will advance your ambitions, and it appears that you’re quietly keeping them under consideration.  But intelligent Mercury in your planning sector opposes Neptune, which means that your thoughts may be jumbled as to what to do next. When Saturn goes direct next Saturday, you’ll be able to gain more clarity.

"
8 august 2017,capricorn,"Something unexpected could happen today that will add to your sense of stability and ease. Maybe it’s a job offer or landing a new client. Perhaps it’s a noisy neighbor finally moving out. A lover might commit or cut the drama. No matter what it is, greater peace of mind is the end result.

"
8 august 2016,capricorn,"With Venus now in your expansive, optimistic ninth house, no doubt you’re ready to see forward movement in your life. Travel plans, going back to school, weddings, business launches, legal affairs–all of these (and more) can start to show improvement. The cosmos has been placing roadblocks in the way recently though, which may have created a sense of frustration. They are still in place today, but tomorrow the logjam starts to break. In the meantime: patience.

"
9 august 2017,capricorn,"You’re such a dedicated person, always charging forward in life, that you tend to lose touch of the real person deep inside of you. But today the planets give you the chance to connect with your inner spirit. Don’t worry–you can do this without losing control!

"
9 august 2016,capricorn,"Recent planetary activity has made you unsure of a course of action, wondering whether your ideas and plans are realistic and attainable. Today the doubts begin to slip away and confidence appears. It will grow in the days ahead, and when Saturn goes direct on Saturday, you’ll swing into action. But keeping things on the downlow is the way to go.

"
10 august 2017,capricorn,"Want to see more money in your wallet–and your bank account? Then it’s time to start hustling, as the recent eclipse was all about developing more security. A brilliant idea for a side business, passive income stream or partnership could come your way today–get ready to talk to others about it.

A fabulous aspect between Mercury and Pluto will have your brain spinning with far-reaching ideas. And the best part? You’ll be able to pitch them or explain them to others.

"
11 august 2017,capricorn,"Building a successful, firm financial foundation is the order of the day with a Sun-Jupiter connection. The recent eclipse was all about increasing your income, and today the planets want you to consider wealth-building strategies. Not just ways to pull in a few extra bucks; wealth.  

"
11 august 2016,capricorn,"It seems like you have a number of ambitious plans either in action or under consideration, Capricorn. An auspicious Moon-Jupiter angle suggests that one could be quite profitable, especially if it involves technology, an app, a website or social media. Start working on it. The planets suggest that two heads are better than one right now, so team up with capable and discrete team members.

"
12 august 2017,capricorn,"With so much planetary activity in your financial houses in August, you are probably raring to go when it comes to earning, saving and investing. However, Mercury retrogrades today in the house that governs “big plans”: going international with your business, for example, or trying to land media attention. This can actually be a blessing in disguise as it will force you to pay attention to the finer details before you eventually launch.

"
12 august 2016,capricorn,"Adios, agendas. Buh-bye, bulls****rs. Take a number, oh toxic one. Capricorn is done  being a doormat, and if you have any doubts, just wait until Saturn goes direct tomorrow and they start cutting the dead wood from their lives. But today is the warm-up, as the emotional Moon swings past assertive Mars and logical Saturn. Yup, there’s a new Cap in town, pardner.

But it’s yours for the taking with a fabulous Sun-Saturn trine, which is creating stability and peace in the deepest part of your psyche. Will it require tossing out old ways of thinking? Yes—that’s what enlightenment is all about.

"
13 august 2016,capricorn,"Phew. Take a deep breath, sturdy goat–Saturn, your ruler, moves direct today after five months of spinning backward in the heavens through the most sensitive and psychological part of your chart. No doubt you’ve done a lot of thinking, which may have taken you down some bumpy mental roads. Hopefully you’ve come to realize what (and who) needs to stay in your life, and what needs to go. Let the fresh new changes begin.

"
14 august 2017,capricorn,"Just how much more of yourself do you want to put into a key relationship? Some goats are willing to immerse themselves even more, while others may feel like pulling back a bit. The choice is yours. It really comes down to how strong you feel in the union.

"
14 august 2016,capricorn,"Like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, you’re ready for a new beginning. Saturn’s five-month retro turn ended yesterday, and you spent all of that time in cocoon land, building the DNA for a transformation. Just don’t get discouraged if things don’t take off like a rocket. Venus opposes Neptune, indicating that you still have some thought patterns that need to change in order to move ahead.

"
15 august 2017,capricorn,"You’re in a cosmic place right now in which you’re trying to figure out just how much “mental real estate” you want to devote to other people and their problems. A part of you suggests being a giver, while another part warns you to give them the space to figure things out on their own. When Saturn goes direct on the 25th you’ll have it figured out.

"
15 august 2016,capricorn,"You may be on the fence about which direction to head in with a particular issue. A Saturn-Neptune square may be causing you to second guess yourself. But a power lunch between the Moon and Pluto in your sign signifies that logical thinking will win out in the end. However, doing things the same old way isn’t favored, so start thinking out of the box.

16 august 2017,capricorn,"You need to get caught up on a lot of tasks, and the Moon is in a very motivational spot. The key to succeeding is to stay away from endless trawling on the internet, chatting on social media, texting your friends and gabbing on the phone. Next week’s eclipse will find you focusing like a laser beam, so today is good practice!

"
16 august 2016,capricorn,"Over the next few days your desire for taking a chance may clash with your interest in maintaining a secure foundation, but this is actually a good problem! A fortuitous trine today between the Sun and Uranus could bring some positive financial news or opportunities that will help you increase your bottom line. Tomorrow, another happy trine encourages you to push past previous limits. You can  have your cake and eat it too.

"
17 august 2017,capricorn,"With diplomatic Venus in your house of partnerships, you’re in a good place to play well with others. Problem is, they may not be feeling that kind of team spirit. Don’t be surprised if someone tries to pull rank or gets bossy in some way. The good news is that this passes quickly, and by the weekend you’re back on track.

"
17 august 2016,capricorn,"It’s decision time, Capricorn. With Mars and Saturn moving ever closer in your house of boundaries, you’re going to make some key determinations about what needs to stay in your life and what needs to go. And today the cosmos delivers one heck of a gift–a trine between Venus and Pluto, which will open up your eyes to new possibilities. The lights ahead are all green–step on the gas!

"
18 august 2017,capricorn,"There has been a lot of cosmic energy over the past few weeks that may have found you desiring more freedom in an alliance. Today, though, the planets are aligned in such a way that you can get back on the same page with someone. Open up and find out what it’s going to take to make this work.

"
18 august 2016,capricorn,"Payday! Who doesn’t love that word? Well, that’s what the cosmos has in mind for you today, Capricorn, as a glistening full moon occurs in your house of income. You could be wrapping up interviews for a new job or getting ready to make a big change, such as changing fields or going the entrepreneurial route. A happy Sun-Uranus aspect indicates that whatever you’re working on has a strong profit potential. Surprising support could come from someone you wouldn’t expect.

"
19 august 2016,capricorn,"It’s time to take a step back and examine some long term plans or goals. Something’s gotta give, because you may have taken on more than you can handle. Performing excellent work is a hallmark of your sign; fast and sloppy results don’t cut it. Remove unnecessary or time-consuming commitments and tasks from your daily routine if you want to move ahead with more efficiency–and serenity.

"
20 august 2016,capricorn,"Ambitious plans are getting ready to take off, Capricorn! Intelligent Mercury is holding conversations with optimistic Jupiter in your expansive ninth house, and Venus intends to lend a helping hand. When the fiery Sun barrels in to Virgo to meet them on Monday, it’s blue skies ahead. But a Moon-Venus opposition today may be challenging your confidence. If you pay attention to the details of your goals or projects, the big picture will take care of itself.

"
21 august 2016,capricorn,"An interesting mix of planetary angles is urging you to take a gamble on living differently, yet other planets are telling you to take the same old comfortable route. With Saturn and Mars moving closer to each other in the heavens, you’re going to have to make a decision: safety or spontaneity? Tried and true or something new? Wednesday it all comes together.

"
22 august 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes life seems to offer us very little when it comes to choices, but then at other times we can be overwhelmed by possibilities. And you, Capricorn, are about to enter a sweet period in which picking which path to go down is going to be tough, as choices abound. (We should all have such difficulties!) That’s because the mighty Sun enters Virgo today, your expansive house of travel, study, entrepreneurship and adventure. It joins three other benevolent planets whose goal it is to point out experiences that will help you grow and enjoy life more.

"
23 august 2016,capricorn,"Snip! Get out the scissors, Capricorn. Or maybe you need a power saw. The meeting of Mars and Saturn tomorrow is momentous, as it is encouraging you to cut the dead wood from your life. It’s time to get real, be kind to yourself, and dump bad habits and associations. Today the Moon is in fine form, signaling these two from your house of ingenuity. Creative solutions are on the way: grab them and use them!

"
24 august 2016,capricorn,"“The quiet mind is richer than a crown.” This old saying pretty much sums up what today’s aspects are all about, Capricorn. A momentous meeting between Mars and Saturn helps you dump the toxic trash from your mind once and for all. It’s time for peace, serenity and contentment, but only you can make that happen. Get real about what’s not working and then start snipping away. People, habits and situations that take away from the quality of your life need to be dealt with.

"
25 august 2016,capricorn,"It’s time to take a good long look at the way you go about handling your daily grind, both at work and at home. The planets indicate that you need better habits and systems in place. Be brutally honest with yourself. Do you waste too much time trawling the net? Should you hire someone to come in and clean rather doing it yourself? Are you waiting til the last minute to hand in work assignments? Everyone can become more efficient (yeah, I’m talking to you, Martha Stewart). Find hacks that simplify your routine. Serenity will be the happy result.

"
26 august 2016,capricorn,"Are your thoughts jumping around like a chimpanzee? If you’ve ever tried to meditate you know what “monkey mind” is all about. Yup, mindfulness ain’t as easy as it sounds, and today’s Mars-Neptune square will point that out. The good news is that both Mars and Saturn in the house of your subconscious mind are  trying to bring you more peace. But Neptune is churning up the waves, making it hard to reach that “mind like water” place. Just slow down and tell that monkey to take a hike.

"
27 august 2016,capricorn,"It’s time to broaden your horizons, in more ways than one. A positive meeting today between optimistic Jupiter and magnetic Venus encourages you to open up your mind to fresh new circumstances and people. New love could be coming your way, someone who’s not cut from the usual old cloth. You may be feeling quite entrepreneurial too, considering ways to expand your influence and income. An eclipse next week on the 1st will put rocket boosters under your plans.

"
28 august 2016,capricorn,"Work smarter, not harder. That’s the message from the cosmos today as the North Node of the moon squares Mars and Saturn. Putting in 80 hours a week, exerting more effort than all of your co-workers or doing all the grunt work at home by yourself isn’t going to get you anywhere, other than tired and fed up. There’s no glory in being a martyr or a workhorse. Change your MO.

"
29 august 2016,capricorn,"Ambitious new plans can be kicked off, thanks to easy peasy Venus entering your house of career and success. But Mercury goes retrograde tomorrow in your house of long-range planning, indicating that you need to take a few steps back and review everything before you leap in. A solar eclipse on Thursday will help you research your options and solidify your strategy.

"
30 august 2016,capricorn,"Your career is about to take a quantum leap ahead over the next year as major planets are getting ready to enter that part of your chart. No doubt about it, the next thirteen months will be monumental if you work with the planetary energies on offer. The change has just begun with profitable Venus just entering your ambition sector. Mercury retrogrades, though, in the house of expansion, indicating that before you kick off a grandiose strategy or game plan that you have all the details figured out first.

"
31 august 2016,capricorn,"As the mysterious moon glides into Virgo your brain will start dreaming up some pretty interesting scenarios for the future. Some might call them fantasies, but hey–you’re a freakin’ realistic Capricorn! Veering into Lala Land is not how you operate. So continue to dream, but back up your plans with a solid strategy. Mercury being retrograde in your expansive ninth house will actually help you with this.

"
1 september 2016,capricorn,"Visionary. That’s the best way to describe you these days, thanks to a bevy of planets in your enterprising house of expanded perspectives. To top it off, a zinger of a solar eclipse occurs in the same part of the sky today, making you the guy or the gal with the sharp ideas. Publishing, media, lecturing, the travel circuit and entrepreneurship are all favored under these aspects. Got a message you want to get out there? Don’t hold back.

"
2 september 2016,capricorn,"It’s not enough to think big, which you’ll be doing today as clever Mercury holds a powwow with go-big-or-go-home Jupiter. You need to consider plans from all angles. As famed architect Mies van der Rohe said, “God is in the details” and he ought to know. In building a masterpiece, whether it’s a skyscraper or your future, focusing on the small stuff is just as important as the goal.

"
3 september 2016,capricorn,"Hmm, someone’s feeling frisky and powerful this weekend, and it’s a Capricorn! The passionate Moon is amping up your mojo both in love and business. You’ll be willing to take risks and show the world just what you’ve got going on in that brain and heart of yours. The recent eclipse was all about living a bigger life. Might as well start now!

"
4 september 2016,capricorn,"You’re on the verge of some Seriously Big Stuff, Capricorn. Lucky Jupiter is about to enter your house of ambition and success for the first time in 13 years, a life changing situation. But in order to finesse this amazing time period (which will last into October of 2017), you need to step into your own  power. Will you have to please bosses and clients and other people? Of course. But you can do so and maintain your own sense of authority at the same time.

"
5 september 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes the best way to develop a position of strength is to be as low key as possible, and that’s what the planets are suggesting, Capricorn. There’s no need to be loud and proud or to dazzle others with your brilliance. As long as you know that you have the chops, that’s all it takes. With Saturn and Mars in the most reclusive, secretive part of your chart, true power lies in not letting people know that you have it.

"
6 september 2016,capricorn,"You’re usually the careful sort, not taking risks without thinking them through first. An amazing aspect tomorrow between the Sun and Pluto bodes well for launching big plans and initiatives, but make sure that you double check all the details before you proceed. With Mercury retrograde in your house of expansion, everything needs to be clarified. That being said, plans that were shelved awhile back may come back to life–in a big way.

"
7 september 2016,capricorn,"It’s so easy to get caught up in the minutiae of our daily grind that we fail to see the big picture. This is especially true of the hard working goat, whose nose is so stuck to the grindstone that they forget what they’re aiming for! That’s about to change. The Sun forms a spectacular trine with Pluto today, opening your eyes to future possibilities. But it’s more than that—you’re changing as a person, becoming more authoritative and wiser with every day. When Jupiter enters your ambition sector this Friday, ain’t nothin’ gonna stop this goat.

"
8 september 2016,capricorn,"Powerful forces are at work in the quiet recesses of your mind, making you question what path to follow next, especially in your career. With the Moon, Mars and Saturn all behind closed doors in a meeting on this topic, give yourself time to ruminate about your options. But with Neptune in a tricky angle, keep your plans to yourself, at least for now.

"
9 september 2016,capricorn,"Everyone’s going to be jellin’ over you, Capricorn, so get used to the green-eyed monsters out there! Lucky Jupiter just entered your house of ambition and success for the first time since 2005, making you the most likely sign to hit the ball out of the park when it comes to your career and other major goals. Nothing is going to stop you, as the experiences of the past year taught you to think out of the box and not settle for less.

"
10 september 2016,capricorn,"Reality check! Stern Saturn squares murky Neptune today, demanding that we are realistic and not operating on fantasy. In your case, Capricorn, pay close attention to the words spoken or written by others. They may be hiding something. The ringed planet is in your house of intuition, so if your gut is telling you that something’s off, it probably is.

"
11 september 2016,capricorn,"You may feel befuddled today as a square between Venus and Pluto puts you in the midst of some serious soul-searching. Who are you, anyway, and what do you stand for? Now that Jupiter is in your authoritative tenth house you’re going to want to take more control over your life. Now’s a good time to think about it.

"
12 september 2016,capricorn,"Lucky goat! Abundant Jupiter just glided into your house of ambition and success, setting up a year ahead for hitting your targets. And today the fiery Sun and intelligent Mercury hold a meeting about how to expand into new areas, whatever that means to you. But Pluto is in a tough spot from your house of confidentiality, which means that you need to protect valuable ideas and share them with only the most trusted confidantes.

"
13 september 2016,capricorn,"You’re about to enter a phase in life in which you’re going to feel like a sponge, soaking up as much information as you can. Friday’s lunar eclipse will make you hunger for knowledge. Today, however, you could feel stymied as pieces of information you need just aren’t coming your way as easily as you’d like. This will pass, and the 20th is a super day for getting down to the nitty gritty about a situation.

"
14 september 2016,capricorn,"Sports psychologist Dr. Jim Loehr has worked with some of the greatest athletes of our time, from tennis players to Olympians. One of the key things he discovered that, if equipped with the same degree of talent, the athlete who goes on to become a champion has set up routines and habits that they stick to religiously. And that’s what the cosmos is telling you to today. Whether it’s weight loss, remaining calm around your kids or getting through the projects on your desk, you need to establish successful protocols.

"
15 september 2016,capricorn,"Words and ideas that have building up inside of you are reaching a point where they should be expressed, Capricorn. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in the communications part of your chart will light a fire under you to say what’s on your mind, whether it’s a talk with a friend or finally writing that book. But today murky Neptune may be clouding your thoughts. Hold off a bit before getting out ideas out there.

"
16 september 2016,capricorn,"You’re in the driver’s seat, Capricorn. Lucky Jupiter entered your career house back on the 9th, setting up a year in which you can take your ambitions to the stratosphere. And the best way to do that? Shout it from the mountaintops: your talent, skills, work history. A lunar eclipse today in your communications sector is perfect for self-promotion, blogging, teaching, advertising and hitting the lecture circuit, not to mention performing research on your area of expertise.

"
17 september 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes getting your feelings out there is about a comfortable as detonating a bomb. Other times it’s as smooth as silk. Fortunately, a happy Mars-Uranus trine today lets you get things off your chest with as little drama as possible. You may not be planning on having a talk, but something could happen that will suddenly open the door to discussion.

"
18 september 2016,capricorn,"You may find it hard to focus on your goals and ambitions as a Venus-Uranus opposition takes place in the heavens. It’s possible that family members and others are vying for your attention, and you could also be taking your job home with you. When the Sun enters Libra on Thursday, however, you’ll be as focused as a laser beam.

"
19 september 2016,capricorn,"Get ready to shed your skin, Capricorn. A new person is about to merge from the person that was previously you! Mars, in the most reflective part of your chart, is shaking you up to consider your options. It forms a magnificent angle with Venus in your house of ambition and success. Just get out of your own way and let some changes take place.

"
20 september 2016,capricorn,"Thinking about going back to school, traveling the world or expanding your mind through philosophy or metaphysics? Maybe you want to expand your reach in the business world, such as going international or creating an online store. If that’s the case, you’re in luck. A fortuitous trine between Mercury and Pluto allows you to research your options. By Friday you’ll have a clearer picture as to your next move.

"
22 september 2016,capricorn,"Ready to make some serious progress with your ambitions? Good, because the Sun has just entered the most success oriented part of your chart where it will remain for four weeks. El Sol will join abundant Jupiter, making this one of your most auspicious times in over a decade to kick butt. These two join forces on the 26th, your best day of the year for advancement.

"
23 september 2016,capricorn,"Hmmm…is it wise to partner up with someone in business? That’s the question today as the Moon squares Jupiter, one of the planets that governs profits. Right now powerful Pluto is retrograde in your sign, making you question your work environment and the people you do business with. When it goes direct next Monday things will become more clear.

"
24 september 2016,capricorn,"You have just entered a highly productive time in which you can advance in just about any area of your choosing. Mercury and Pluto are both encouraging you to explore new paths that you may not have considered in the past. The question is whether you should travel alone or take a partner with you. Consider the pros and cons.

"
25 september 2016,capricorn,"With Jupiter and the Sun moving ever closer in the cosmos your sense of authority and personal power should be on the rise. Today the Moon is encouraging you to examine some of your deepest feelings and emotions, especially those that may have held you back in the past. However, you may want to keep these thoughts to yourself, as it seems that a friend might not be on board with the newer and more focused Capricorn you’re becoming.

"
26 september 2016,capricorn,"Sweet! Lucky (and profitable) Jupiter meets up with the Sun only once a year, and today’s the day. They’re discussing your future–specifically, your career and other big ambitions. The next 12 months are the best in over a decade to make progress, and the seeds you plant today could bear some pretty impressive fruit. A new moon in the same part of the sky this Saturday can catapult you to a whole new playing field.

"
27 september 2016,capricorn,"No one had better get in a Capricorn’s way over the next seven weeks! They might get run over, not because the fearless goat is being mean or inconsiderate, but because you are going to be more powerful than a tornado. First up: Pluto has been retrograde in Capricorn for five months, forcing you to analyze just about every aspect of your life. Where are you giving your power away? What flaws or problematic issues need to be addressed or removed? Well, Pluto just went direct. Secondly: Mars blasts into your sign today for the first time in two years, providing you with ambition and energy to spare. These aspects are a gift from the cosmos, Cappie. Go for it!

"
28 september 2016,capricorn,"If you’re in the process of planning something big, such as your wedding, attending college or taking a long trip overseas, make sure that you have all of your facts straight and the details spelled out. Even if your life is just “business as usual” you need to keep your eye on the small stuff, as it appears that a source may not be giving you the straight story about important details.

"
29 september 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes we need a swift kick in the pants to get us out of our comfort zone and into a new place that pushes up against old boundaries. Well, Uranus is the butt kicker of the cosmos and today it’s telling you to stretch a bit. It looks like you need to reevaluate your plans and ideas, and make them bigger and bolder than before.

"
30 september 2016,capricorn,"Your ambitions will be center stage over the next few weeks, so by all means get moving with whatever big plans you have in mind. But keep your lips zipped about what you’re up to as a tense Saturn-Neptune aspect demands discretion. You also need to make sure that you’re getting the straight story from others as Neptune could be blowing a lot of smoke in your direction.

"
1 october 2016,capricorn,"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! Capricorns are the most fired-up sign in the zodiac as today’s new moon occurs in your house of fame, honor and success. This may easily be your best new moon in over 10 years for initiating activities that will help you reach your ambitions, whatever they may be. A sexy Venus-Neptune trine also makes this weekend a honey for romance. With Venus in your house of big dreams and Neptune in the communications sector, it’s an auspicious time to talk to your lover about where your relationship is heading. Singles: online dating sites and introductions from friends are your best way to go right now.

"
2 october 2016,capricorn,"Expanding your contacts should be at the top of your list over the next few weeks, especially when it comes to furthering your career. Don’t just consider the tried and true, or the people in your own back yard. There may be valuable insights to be gleaned from folks in other industries or geographic areas. Keep an open mind and expect valuable wisdom to come your way.

"
3 october 2016,capricorn,"Diplomacy is a skill that some people have mastered and others have not. You may need to finesse this skill this week, as planets are putting you in a position of authority. Whether you’re being offered a leadership position or you’re quietly becoming a force to be reckoned with behind the scenes, other  authority figures may start viewing you as a threat. And rightly so. Your talents won’t be kept hidden for long.

"
4 october 2016,capricorn,"Sometimes the best way to impress someone is to sit back, say little and let your talent speak for itself. A powerful Sun-Saturn aspect puts your talents in front of others and the best part is, you may not even realize it. Yet. You’re in a magnificent career phase right now, so despite today’s energy you should still be (ever so subtly) promoting your skills.

"
5 october 2016,capricorn,"A friend, mentor or trusted confidante could provide you with feedback today that could change your life in a big way. Perhaps they make you realize that you’ve got your s*** together more than you realized, or they helpfully point out a direction you should be heading in. If in doubt about something open up to someone, and let them help you “reboot” your attitude.

"
6 october 2016,capricorn,"Steer clear of authority figures if you can over the next few days, as a tough Mars-Jupiter aspect could create some flak. The reality is that you are becoming a much more potent figure in your career, or that you’re really ready to hunker down and go after some big ambitions. Which is good—but you run the risk of pushing up against a power broker. Find a balance between attainment of your own goals while pleasing the muckety-mucks.

"
7 october 2016,capricorn,"Virgos have a reputation for being the list makers, organizers and control freaks of the zodiac, but over the next few weeks Capricorns are going to have them beat. With the Sun and Jupiter forming a formidable team in your tenth house of ambition, nothing is going to get in your way. And today intelligent, perceptive Mercury joins them, providing you with even more mental acuity for going after your goals. One caveat though: strong-willed Pluto is in Capricorn, making you as forceful and determined as a Sherman tank. Just don’t roll over everyone, squashing them as you confidently move ahead.

"
8 october 2016,capricorn,"Stay out of Cappie’s way today! No, they’re not angry or rude. Just highly motivated. The passionate Moon is in their sign, swinging past Mars and Pluto, helping them reduce inertia and gain momentum as they move forward with their audacious plans. Better yet is that inspirational Neptune is in a super angle from their house of thinking and self-expression, allowing them to communicate their ideas with fervor and eloquence.

"
9 october 2016,capricorn,"A sudden burst of cosmic wisdom may jolt you into reconsidering just who you are and where you’re going in life. Complacency, being in a rut, doing things the same old way–it’s time to move away from the tried and true and take a risk. Metamorphic Pluto in your sign demands it, and with Mars by its side, you’ll have the energy to make some seriously big changes.

"
10 october 2016,capricorn,"Some positive planetary aspects are lining up to help you feel more secure, both financially and emotionally. The Moon is in your house of self-esteem today, signaling abundant Jupiter in your house of authority. The phrase “fake it til you make it” comes to mind. But with so much cosmic fire power backing you up, you won’t be faking it for long.

"
11 october 2016,capricorn,"It’s not enough to have a plan, scheme or a dream—often times you need to discuss it, promote it, and yes, plan it. An auspicious meeting today between Mercury and Jupiter helps you focus on your grandest ambitions in a big way—then put pen to paper and draw up a battle plan. A helpful meeting between Mars and Neptune provides you with the drive and the communications skills to then venture forth. It’s not often that you can size the brass ring like this—work it!

"
12 october 2016,capricorn,"As the vibey Moon moves closer to Neptune, your intuitive powers are increasing. You may be questioning a close connection, such as a friend or a person who’s part of a group you’re involved with. If you suspect that something is off, keep it to yourself. Just sit back and observe.

"
13 october 2016,capricorn,"Paralysis by analysis? Your brain may be so busy churning over details and possible scenarios that you can’t see clearly. Right now you have more drive to achieve than just about any other sign of the zodiac, but there is such a thing as pushing too hard. Your batteries may be run down: take some time to recharge them this weekend.

"
14 october 2016,capricorn,"New Age gurus like to talk about “fear of success”, but people of the Capricorn persuasion aren’t afraid of getting ahead. That being said, we all have thought patterns and habits that can get in our way when we’re trying to make progress. Be honest with yourself and identify what might be holding you back. With go-getter Mercury in your house of ambition forming a super angle with disciplined Saturn in the habits sector, you can cut through the roadblocks and move ahead.

"
15 october 2016,capricorn,"It may be time to step away from your responsibilities, if just for a day or two. You’ve been pushing so hard that you may be neglecting people and activities that are essential. Like: sleep, doing the laundry, talking to friends, relaxing with a good book or a movie, or balancing your checkbook. People close to you may be getting cranky, and you also run the risk of burnout. Chill.

"
16 october 2016,capricorn,"It seems that you need to tend to your home life, Capricorn, a necessary situation brought on by today’s full moon. Even if you’re single you may still have family or house-related issues to manage. Rebellious Uranus is acting up, suggesting that a family member, roommate or landlord could throw you a curve ball. But there could also be a happy and unexpected event that takes place, such as a pregnancy or declaration of love. With all the hours you’ve been putting into chasing down your goals, you need some down time too—by all means take it and recharge your batteries.

"
17 october 2016,capricorn,"Your focus and determination are building, Capricorn, as a series of powerful and metamorphic planetary aspects bless you with extraordinary vision about your future. Today a super moon-Pluto angle brings out your creativity and talent and the desire to hone your skills. Outside matters (and people) may even seem superfluous, but this can be a good thing. You can’t afford to sweat the small stuff these days.

"
18 october 2016,capricorn,"A secret weapon is just about ready to be placed in your hands, Capricorn! Your aspects for going after your goals and passions is amazing, courtesy of hosting Mars and Pluto in your sign. Your motivation and discipline are sky rocketing. And now Venus traipses into your hush-hush house of intuition for a three-week stay, ramping up your ability to figure out what smart move to make next. Pay close attention to your dreams and gut hunches–they can take you to a much higher level of living.

"
19 october 2016,capricorn,"Today can go one of two ways: “wow!” or “ow!”  That’s because two heavy hitters, Mars and Pluto, are meeting up in your sign. If you use this energy wisely, you can cast away doubts, fears and concerns about being not good enough, and instead morph into a force of nature. But if you overstep your bounds you might crush other people, who will no doubt then have you in their crosshairs. Think Jedi knight and use your skills for the greater good (even if it’s just your own good) rather than for trouble. Personal power is a sword that can cut two ways.

"
20 october 2016,capricorn,"You may have come to the realization lately that you need to get your emotions and thoughts under control. The recent full moon highlighted the need to release mood swings and negative thinking. Today, a tough Mercury-Uranus angle repeats this message—so pay attention! Fortunately Mars and Pluto are determined to clear the cobwebs from your brain and to turn you into a peaceful warrior.

"
21 october 2016,capricorn,"Recent planetary aspects have turned you into something of a Lone Ranger, so focused are you to make progress with your life. Is there room for romance or a new business alliance? That question may be on your mind with a Moon-Mars-Pluto opposition. It’s also possible that an existing partner is getting a bit peeved by a lack of attention coming from your general direction. This will pass quickly, but know that once the Sun rolls into Scorpio later this week, you’ll be feeling a lot more social.

"
22 october 2016,capricorn,"You’ve been working hard, Capricorn, and now it’s time to rejoin the human race in a more social way! The Sun has just entered Scorpio, your eleventh house of camaraderie. Make plans to get together with your friends, search for love via a pal (and online is auspicious these days too). The eleventh house governs the digital world, so those Caps with an online business can make some big strides over the next four weeks. Network at trade events and attend seminars to sharpen your skills. But don’t forget that all work and no play is going to make for one boring and tired goat. Book some time to let your hair down and party.

"
23 october 2016,capricorn,"Some big goals appear to need readjusting under today’s planetary influences. This doesn’t mean tossing them out or giving up; rather, a simple review and reframing if necessary. The good news is that the two most inspirational planets, Jupiter and Neptune, are by your side, blessing you with insight and creativity. And that may be just what your plans need—a dollop of artistic flair or an illuminating viewpoint.

"
24 october 2016,capricorn,"Power up your iPhone and get ready to start networking. Now that Mercury has just joined the Sun in your house of friends and business contacts, the time is right for mingling with like minded people. This holds true for volunteer and charity work, so if you’ve been considering lending your time and talent to a worthy cause, go for it. Attend seminars, go to church, throw a party and schedule some brunches. It’s all good.

25 october 2016,capricorn,"Don’t hear what you want to hear today, nor should you schmooze people with insincere remarks just to gain favor with them. A deceptive Venus-Neptune angle indicates that talk will be cheap today. Make sure that you’re not cheapening your  words! Likewise, read between the lines when you hear or read a statement from someone close, as there could be confusion or deliberate obfuscation there.

"
26 october 2016,capricorn,"This is your best year in over a decade for career advancement, and today brings a profitable meeting between the two most generous and profitable planets. Jupiter is helping you go after your most closely held goals, and Venus in your intuitive twelfth house is providing inspiration. Someone may be interested in helping you too, such as a colleague, friend or mentor. Tomorrow is perfect for making contacts.

"
27 october 2016,capricorn,"Dream on. That’s the message from the cosmos–to dream big, focus on your fondest hopes and wishes. Today is the perfect time to create practical plans for achieving them with a lustrous Sun-Mercury conjunction. Mercury brings its intelligence and perception to the table; the Sun brings authority and ambition. With dynamic Mars and Pluto striding through your first house of the self, your goals should be in the forefront of your mind. Go after them.

"
28 october 2016,capricorn,"You may be getting frustrated with trying to get through to the same people, over and over again. How many times do you have to repeat something? Mars in your sign could make you feel a bit annoyed, and with a Moon-Jupiter angle you might want to take control of a situation. But is it worth it? Or is it going to be the same old drama, just rehashed? Some things just aren’t worth the time and the effort.

"
29 october 2016,capricorn,"Put a fork in it–it’s done! That may be your battle cry today as Venus and Saturn form a powerful conjunction in the heavens. They meet in the house of your subconscious mind, an auspicious placement for finally releasing negative thoughts, bad habits and worn out dramas. The wonderful thing is that Saturn is all about making things stick, such as newer, happier thought patterns, and Venus is all about ease.

"
30 october 2016,capricorn,"A new moon in the house that governs your deepest desires occurs today, Capricorn, and it’s a honey. While it may often seem like achieving our wishes is a bumpy road full of detours and roadblocks, this lunation makes things flow as smooth as silk. That’s because serene Venus is in a superb angle, easing the way. And Neptune, planet of inspiration, fires up your imagination from its perch in your house of thinking and expression. Take this golden new moon and run with it!

"
31 october 2016,capricorn,"Your relationships with others need to be examined, Capricorn, as the planets want you to be more circumspect about the company you keep. Whether it’s friends, co-workers, neighbors, family or a lover, you need to know where you stand. If you feel uneasy about someone’s motives or feelings, pay attention to your gut as it should be right on target. Determine to associate only with people who fill you up–not with those who drag you down.

"
1 november 2016,capricorn,"Inspiration can come from many places, and with Neptune active today, your brain may be buzzing with ideas. The watery planet holds a meeting with the Sun about how you can live a more authentic life. The Sun is in your technology sector, so trawl the Internet for ideas—for home decor, fashion, travel spots to visit, languages you’d like to learn, or business ideas to pursue. Get some Pinterest boards going, buy a book, or listen to a podcast by someone who’s already doing what you’d like to achieve.

"
2 november 2016,capricorn,"Your intuition should be right on target when it comes to assessing the behavior and agendas of the people around you. What they’re saying may not be what they’re thinking or planning, so read between the lines. Use your sixth sense to guide you when it comes to assessing your own game plans too, as you may be expecting things to materialize faster than they really will. A balance of logic and intuition can serve you well, Capricorn.

"
3 november 2016,capricorn,"Your plans and dreams are under review by the cosmos, Capricorn. Pluto’s job is to point out areas of your life that need to be restructured, rebooted or tossed. Considering that this powerful little planet is in your house of self—your image, self-esteem and ambitions—just about anything in your life is up for grabs. Intelligent Mercury and Pluto hold a meeting today, asking that you create a short list of what needs to be changed. While you’re at it, make a bucket list of exciting adventures that you’d like to experience as well!

"
4 november 2016,capricorn,"As the passionate Moon starts traveling through your sign, you may be feeling emotional, especially when it comes to assessing how far you’ve come in 2016. Don’t beat yourself up for not being exactly where you’d like to be. That’s about to change real soon, next week in fact. When magnetic Venus enters your sign on Friday the 11th things will gain momentum.

"
5 november 2016,capricorn,"You may be tempted to toss out the old rule book that says that you have to live your life a certain way. It’s not surprising considering that maverick Uranus is acting up in the house that governs your sense of comfort and security. Are you ready to take a risk, one that will push you past the comfort zone? Pay attention to your gut, as Venus in your house of intuition is blessing you with the gift of insight.

"
6 november 2016,capricorn,"Family ties are called “ties” for a reason. Sometimes your connections to your relatives can feel like a ball and chain–or maybe a noose! And this can occur even when certain family members are long gone, having crossed over to the other side. Uranus jolts you out of the past, allowing you to cut any mental cords that haven’t been pleasant. Even if you still have to deal with a particular person it doesn’t mean that they have the right to take your happiness away.

"
7 november 2016,capricorn,"Over the past few months you’ve been considering what passion projects to pursue and what paths to take. But now it’s time to narrow down your choices and get to work on the ones that speak to your soul–and your wallet! Once Mars changes signs on Wednesday you need to be as focused as a laser beam.

"
8 november 2016,capricorn,"With assertive Mars and transformative Pluto working side by side in your sign over the past 8 weeks, no doubt you’ve concerned yourself with some big plans for the future. You’re not the same person you were even earlier this year, and your goals and ambitions have probably changed. But now it’s time to focus on the “package”, the vessel that will be carrying you into the successful year ahead: your body. Venus enters Cap on Friday, urging you to nurture, protect and pamper that body of yours. And while you’re at it, there’s nothing wrong with a new hairstyle or treating yourself to some chic new clothes. Look and act the part of a winner!

"
9 november 2016,capricorn,"Money machine! Get ready to start seeing a lot more green in the weeks and months ahead. You’ve been hard at work—now start cashing in. Megawatt Mars just entered your income sector for the first time since 2014. Push hard between now and the middle of December, holiday slowdowns be damned. A big boost comes from profitable Venus which enters your sign on Friday, making you (and your message) look like a winner.

"
10 november 2016,capricorn,"A sparkling Moon-Neptune conjunction will help take ideas that have been rolling around in your head, and turn them into something perhaps even bigger than you had originally expected. Sometimes a small spark of an idea ignites a chain reaction that can help you take a brainstorm and run with it. Now is that time!

"
11 november 2016,capricorn,"All eyes are on you now Capricorn—look and act the part of a winner! Now that Mars is charging forcefully through your let’s-make-some-money sector, you’re more than ready to seal some deals, launch businesses and start reaping the rewards of your hard work. But magnetic Venus enters your sign today, telling you to take some time out for pampering, a new hairstyle, some stylin’ clothes and a brand new attitude. Walk the walk and talk the talk.

"
12 november 2016,capricorn,"Your birthday season may be weeks away yet, but the cosmos is already shining its light upon you. Gentle Venus glided into your sign yesterday, suggesting an image and attitude upgrade. And today candid Mercury hustles into the house of your subconscious mind, telling you to dump toxic thoughts so that you can move on to a much better place. Let’s get this early birthday party started now.

"
13 november 2016,capricorn,"As Mercury swings through your house of intuition and inspiration for the next three weeks you should be paying attention to what your gut tells you. A super Mercury-Neptune aspect today is perfect for digging deep into the ocean of creativity and innovation. You may find some pearls of wisdom down there–grab them!

"
14 november 2016,capricorn,"What about love? Today’s full moon in Taurus puts that question front and center. If you’re unhappy in romance, or unhappily single, the planets indicate that a new flame could be on the horizon, and a keeper at that. A strong Mars-Mercury aspect is trying to bring you security–not drama–in love. Someone may be crushing on you behind the scenes, by the way, so keep your radar turned up. And for those of you who are in satisfying relationships, this lunation could take your romance to the next level.

"
15 november 2016,capricorn,"You may be raring to go with a business related project or a job offer, but confusing Neptune muddies up the waters today. It’s imperative that you understand all of the fine points of a deal before you sign or agree to terms. This holds true also for health care issues, such as an insurance policy or the expenses involved in a medical treatment–the kind that you  are responsible for. If possible, wait until early next week to finalize things.

"
16 november 2016,capricorn,"Group dynamics at the office, or within a business relationship, may need some changes. It may simply be a change in attitude on your part about how to react to the nonsense that goes on. Uranus in your house of contentment is acting up, asking you what’s more important: being right, or being serene? If people aren’t willing to change there’s nothing you can do to force them.

"
17 november 2016,capricorn,"You’re far less willing these days to put up with nonsense from other people, but blasting your opinions may not be the best way to go right now! Instead, why don’t you examine the emotions that are creating this lack of patience. While it may be true that people around you really are annoying, is there are more Zenlike way to deal with your reactions?

"
18 november 2016,capricorn,"It’s one thing to day dream and another to become delusional. As Mercury stirs up your subconscious mind, escapist thoughts may arise. The problem is that Neptune may be clouding your vision, leading you to turn them into over-the-top full blown fantasies. Keep your feet on the ground today. Don’t act on anything in which you don’t know all of the facts.

"
19 november 2016,capricorn,"It’s a sweet thing to be a Capricorn these days, as lovely Venus in your sign is amping up your charisma. If you’ve been considering a makeover or just a few minor tweaks to your looks—or your attitude!—then go for it. Now that Neptune has gone direct in your house of self-expression, people will be interested in what you have to say, what you put in writing, and any creative projects that you’ve been working on. Show the world that you’re a force to be reckoned with.

"
20 november 2016,capricorn,"Despite the fact that the holiday season is just about to kick off, you might find yourself in a quieter frame of mind today. A helpful Moon-Uranus trine could be just the impetus you need to slow down and examine your thoughts, feelings and priorities. The planets are determined to bring you greater peace and serenity, something you can certainly use, considering that your ambitions are running sky high.

"
21 november 2016,capricorn,"It’s time for some nurturing and relaxation, now that the Sun is in the most reflective part of your chart. This may sound impossible, or maybe impractical, with assertive Mars blazing a path through your income sector and Jupiter quite active in your house of ambition. But if you don’t slow down you run the risk of burning out. Not only that, taking things at a more relaxed pace will help you assess situations better for what they really are. Do less, and make more progress.

"
22 november 2016,capricorn,"A lot of people talk about “owning your power”, or stepping into it, as if it’s a kind of force field. And in a sense, it is. But that doesn’t mean that it’s a magical entity that can slay dragons or operate like Jedi mind control. Today is a good time to step into your personal power quietly, without a lot of fanfare. If you want to own it, you need to ask yourself why you haven’t felt this way in the past. Once you’ve figured that out, it will be easy to maintain.

"
23 november 2016,capricorn,"If your gut is telling you that something is off, it probably is—and you should be paying attention. Intelligent, quick thinking Mercury and rational Saturn both happen to be together in your vibey house of the subconscious mind and today they hold a powwow. As a result, you need to listen to your intuition and act on it. This is also the house of hush-hush matters, so it’s a super day to quietly apply for a new job, negotiate a business deal behind closed doors, or privately make decisions about your future without informing 27 of your closest friends. Really, does anyone need to know?

"
24 november 2016,capricorn,"Who are you, really? And what is it that you want out of life? That’s the question the cosmos poses to you over the next few days as you try to sort out which path to head down. It’s not surprising that this dilemma has arisen, considering that Jupiter is now in your house of ambition for the first time in 13 years. The issue is that metamorphic Pluto is in your house of self-identity, making you wonder if you’re going after certain goals out of habit or because they’re what other people want you to do. Spend some quiet time this weekend considering your options.

"
25 november 2016,capricorn,"Some major chapters in your life are coming to a close, Capricorn, but this is a good thing. You’re about to enter a phase in which you’re more in charge of your destiny than ever before. But this may not please others, as they don’t like the idea of you striking out on your own. Too bad. Your ambitions can not be denied, so forge ahead with your plans.

"
26 november 2016,capricorn,"Your intuition is in fine form today, so pay attention to what passes through your mind. A sudden burst of inspiration could provide you with just the answers you seek to a situation that may have been niggling away to you for ages, especially if it has to deal with emotional security and peace of mind. You’re in a highly cathartic period with plenty of healing energy around you–take advantage of it.

"
27 november 2016,capricorn,"It’s important this week to be brutally honest about what needs to stay in your life and what has to go. The new moon on Tuesday falls in your house of closure, and its goal is to clean house so that you can move on to a much better place. A smart thing to do today is to consider the effect that family matters, past and present, have on your moods and therefore your happiness. You can’t choose your relatives but you can control your attitude.

"
28 november 2016,capricorn,"Doubts and fears about the present and future may be rattling your cage a bit, but this too shall pass. The problem is that unreliable Uranus is acting up in your house of security and comfort, making you wonder if you have what it takes to move ahead. You do indeed, and the doubts serve a useful purpose. Rushing into situations too quickly is not in your best interest, so it’s wise to be a bit reluctant.

"
29 november 2016,capricorn,"They say that habits make the man (or the woman) and today’s new moon in Sagittarius asks you to reflect upon that statement. Our habits and rituals can make us or break us, and as this lunation falls in the house of the subconscious mind, you now have the opportunity to review practices that aren’t helping you move forward. Being honest with yourself is not always easy, but with optimistic Jupiter in your house of personal power, you can  change–for the better.

"
30 november 2016,capricorn,"Blurt alert! Keep your lips zipped today and tomorrow as a tough Sun-Neptune aspect indicates that you could say the wrong thing. Perhaps it’s an opinion that will offend someone; maybe a secret slips that should have remained confidential. Your thoughts and intuition seem to be right on target, but the people around you may be living in Lala Land. That’s their problem. Keep it real and keep it to yourself.

"
1 december 2016,capricorn,"Few signs of the zodiac work as hard as you do, Capricorn, and today brings a watershed moment. A turning point arises as go-getter Mars holds an important meeting with abundant Jupiter. All of the effort that you’ve been putting in is about to pay off, and you may see signs of this today or in the weeks ahead. Likewise, you may make a life changing decision to make a clean break from past goals, circumstances or situations that no longer serve you. With intelligent Mercury entering your sign tomorrow, you’ll be unstoppable.

"
2 december 2016,capricorn,"Your official birthday season may be weeks away, but the planets are already lining up in your sign, getting you ready for a good year ahead. Today vivacious Mercury zips into Capricorn, helping you come up with solutions to problems, smart ideas to follow up on, and the ability to speak eloquently. You may consider a writing project, such as penning a novel or starting a blog. Perhaps a teaching or public speaking gig awaits you. Jazzing up your self-image is also on the menu as glam Venus happens to be in this house, so let the transformation begin.

"
3 december 2016,capricorn,"It may be the weekend but your mind is on the almighty dollar. Maybe it’s because you’re doing your holiday shopping, or perhaps you’ve been hit with some unexpected expenses. Regardless as to the reason it’s time to start making bank, and serious Saturn has your back. Brainstorm ways that you can earn or save more, then set new habits in motion. When Venus changes signs next Wednesday you may be tempted to shop for luxury items, but hold back for now.

"
4 december 2016,capricorn,"It may be a Sunday, a day of rest for many people, but the planets are pushing Capricorns to hustle, and for good reason. You’re in a pretty amazing place to go after your big dreams, with lucky Jupiter in your house of ambition and Mars in your income sector. Even if making money isn’t your #1 goal, Mars can help you develop the right routines for making things happen, such as losing weight and getting toned. Today these two work in tandem to bring you closer to what you’re envisioning.

"
5 december 2016,capricorn,"Ancient peoples often set up “altars” at home. Some did this as a shrine to honor their ancestors, others viewed it as a practical way to bring worship into their daily lives. Today you might be inspired to create a special place where you can center yourself and find some peace. Checking in with your altar in the morning and evening could become a new habit that will surprise you with its benefits. Your life is about to become less erratic and more predictable–why not celebrate the serenity?

"
6 december 2017,capricorn,"It’s time to get more focused on the things that mean the most to you. You may have been distracted lately; not a typical situation for the hard-working goat, but hey, it happens! Mercury is now direct in the part of your chart that deals with your most cherished dreams. Don’t put them off any longer.

"
6 december 2016,capricorn,"Finding the cash to spend on home or family related expenses is not always easy, as these things can get expensive! But a happy Uranus-Mars aspect today suggests that you might stumble upon a way to finance something that you need or crave. Maybe it’s a 50% sale on that sofa you’ve been eyeing, or a home seller who’s desperate enough to take a low bid. Hunt down a great sale on Christmas and Hanukkah goodies for the family unit—bargains are out there.

"
7 december 2016,capricorn,"The planets are firmly focused on your career, especially the habits that will make you successful—or not! Today can bring about a turn of events as magnetic Venus moves into the part of the sky that helps you establish winning ways. The full moon next Tuesday is all about closure and release, and that includes negative ideas about money and achievement. For now, consider what you need to do to make 2017 a financial and career success. Then begin making changes at the time of the full moon.

"
8 december 2016,capricorn,"The cosmos is telling you that if one thing is necessary in your life right now, it’s order. Getting on top of your chores at home and the office is paramount, along with creating routines and systems that will streamline your daily grind. Greater serenity is one benefit, not to mention a potentially higher level of income. With Venus and Mars both in your earnings sector you can really boost your cash flow. The key is organization.

"
9 december 2016,capricorn,"The ancient Taoist masters believed that the best way to go through life was to carefully control the flow of information to the outside world. They used the analogy of a seedling growing; it needs to be watered, receive nutrition and protected from getting trampled. Therefore, when launching a new venture, they advised to not draw attention to it, otherwise it may get trampled by competitors. That, grasshopper, is the message the cosmos has for you today. Work behind closed doors.

"
11 december 2016,capricorn,"Taking good care of yourself shouldn’t be something you think about once a month, or worse, once a year! You need some extreme self-care, NOW. With so many planets in your houses of ambition, money and plowing through assignments and chores, you run the risk of burnout, not to mention being cranky. Make plans today to pamper and indulge yourself. Even if you can’t pull it off till next weekend, say, book it. You’re working too hard to not reward yourself.

"
12 december 2016,capricorn,"Inner work. The cosmos demands that you take stock of your attitudes and philosophies, as it appears that something’s gotta give. Often times we can be our worst enemy, but you don’t have to be in that position. Nor do you need years of angst-ridden therapy. A sudden, energetic blast of fresh air may waft through your mind today, clearing out the cobwebs. Hallelujah!

"
13 december 2016,capricorn,"If you’ve been avoiding the process of getting your act together, today’s full moon will give you a swift kick in the butt! It’s time to become a lot more organized and productive both at the office and at home. The problem is that you seem to have so many projects going that things are starting to fall through the cracks. Perhaps you’re spending too many late hours at work, not leaving enough time for keeping up with things at home. Regardless, with lucky Jupiter in your house of ambition til next October, the only way to reach your goals is to have a streamlined plan.

"
14 december 2016,capricorn,"There could be a subtle undercurrent going on, making you wonder if you’re getting the straight story from people around you. Politics and game playing may be draining your energy, Capricorn, to the point where you just want to crawl into bed for a long winter’s nap. But have no fear: the sturdy goat will be back on the trail in no time! When the Sun enters your sign next week, your energy will return. As for the people around you, you’ll be so focused on your end game that you won’t even notice them.

"
15 december 2016,capricorn,"You may be anxious to tackle things on your to-do list, not to mention your grander plans. But sometimes ya just gotta keep those home fires burning! Don’t neglect your family, lover or even yourself right now. If you do, you’ll hear about it from someone close. Your batteries seem to be in need of recharging too, so get some rest and slow down a bit. Don’t worry—when the Sun enters your sign next week, you’ll be operating at warp speed.

"
17 december 2016,capricorn,"I always love it when I look at someone’s chart and realize that the cosmos is telling them to slow down and enjoy life, and that’s what the planets are saying to you today, Capricorn! Specifically they’re suggesting that you spend a little time and cash turning your home into a more serene and relaxing abode. Pick up some luscious bath bubbles and body lotion. Buy some comfy pillows for the sofa or some new sheets. If you’re really ambitious, create a special spot for doing yoga, meditating or indulging in your hobbies. Think “home spa” and you’ll have the right idea.

"
18 december 2016,capricorn,"Your opinion of yourself is going to be under review in the weeks ahead, Capricorn. With both Mars and Venus occupying your house of self-worth, you’re in an excellent position to start feeling more positive. So why the doubts? The Moon in Leo is making you question if you have what it takes–to be a good lover or parent, to land the job, to score the success, to be serene and at peace. You do–and you will understand that after Mercury retrogrades in your sign tomorrow.

"
19 december 2016,capricorn,"Your brain will be working double overtime in the next seven weeks, Capricorn! Megawatt Mars has just entered your house of thinking, speaking and all forms of self-expression. This is a super placement for inventing, writing, drawing, blogging, teaching and coming up with smart business ideas. The only problem is that Mercury retrogrades in your sign for three weeks. The message? Brainstorm away but do your research before you go public with new plans.

"
20 december 2016,capricorn,"Your energy level should be rising as your celestial birthday season approaches. Start thinking about what you’d like to experience in the year ahead, which may involve doing less, rather than more. With serious Saturn in your house of closure and trimming the excess, perhaps you need to remove yourself from certain obligations and activities in order to focus on a critical few.

"
21 december 2016,capricorn,"A drumroll, please…the Sun enters Capricorn today! The next four weeks are literally your days in the Sun, as it spotlights what is most important to you. Get a handle on what you’d like to experience over the next year, as things can start moving rapidly as early as next week. If your energy level is low, do whatever it takes to recharge those batteries. The cosmic aspects are too positive to be squandered. Saturday is the perfect time to chill out and heal with a rare Saturn-Uranus aspect.

"
22 december 2016,capricorn,"How can you fit in all of your aspirations and still find time for yourself and the people you love? That’s the question today as the passionate Moon meets up with Jupiter. This topic won’t be going away soon, by the way, as the energetic Sun is encouraging you to pursue your dreams. Duty calls, however, and you don’t want to neglect quality time with people or self-care. The good news is that Mercury retrograde in your sign will help you come up with a solution.

"
23 december 2016,capricorn,"The urge to expand your contact list could increase today as assertive Mars suggests rubbing elbows with new people. With a new moon occurring in your sign on the 29th, you’ll be the belle or the beau of the ball, so make plans to get out there, not only on New Year’s Eve but the weeks and months ahead.

"
24 december 2016,capricorn,"It’s time to let go, Capricorn. A cathartic aspect between Saturn and Uranus is designed to help you finally release pain and a sense of unease.

"
25 december 2016,capricorn,"You’re starting to feel  more settled and secure on an emotional level. A highly cathartic set of aspects today bodes well for releasing the past and ignoring the crappy part of the present! This Thursday’s new moon falls in your sign, Capricorn, so “out with the old and in with the new” can start right now. Don’t wait another day.

"
26 december 2016,capricorn,"You seem to have a lot of balls in the air and worry about dropping some of them. How can you maintain a schedule that leaves time for family, a lover and your own personal interests? It ain’t easy, but with the Sun and Mercury in your sign, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to reflect upon this topic. Do it now before the new year starts. This week’s new moon in Capricorn is the perfect time to launch new endeavors; maybe you need to pare your list.

"
27 december 2016,capricorn,"Put as much time as you can into your passion projects as Mars is stoking your brain to come up with some pretty smart ideas. The rest of the world may be in holiday mode, but you need to strike while the iron is hot. Start promoting yourself while you’re at it.

28 december 2016,capricorn,"Buddha said, “What we think, we become” and truer words were never spoken for you, Capricorn. With the Sun and intelligent Mercury in your sign, inspiring your thoughts, positive actions can follow. Motivator Mars is in your house of expression, taking your thoughts and turning them into deeds. Make sure that your thoughts take you to a place where you want to go. There’s no pint in wallowing in the muck and mire.

"
29 december 2016,capricorn,"It’s time to start pleasing yourself instead of everyone around you. Today’s new moon in Capricorn is your birthday present from the cosmos to use as you see fit. Think of it as a gift card that can be applied toward any dream or passion of your choosing. Does that mean that goodies are just going to be dumped in your lap? Heck no. You’ll have to work for them, but with energetic Mars in your house of self expression, it’s time to get your ideas out there.

"
30 december 2016,capricorn,"The new year has already begun for you, Capricorn, thanks to the new moon in your sign yesterday. With inspirational Neptune so active in your chart between now and next week, have some fun and really let your brain dream up some exciting new scenarios that you’d like to see unfold in 2017. Neptune can take people to a delusional place, but not you, not now. You know exactly what you want and how to get there.

"
31 december 2016,capricorn,"Get ready to ring out a year that required a lot of hard work and not enough time for play, Capricorn! One of your 2017 resolutions should be to take more down time for yourself. With energetic Mars currently in the most social part of your chart, you can get rolling with that enjoyable goal right away! Mars will be in this spot for most of the month of January so make the most of it.

"
1 january 2017,aquarius,"You’ll be looking for guarantees as 2017 begins, needing to know exactly what lies ahead as January begins today. Shaky job situations, uncertainty in romance and other issues with big question marks around them just won’t work for you! But the reality is that if you want more security in the present and confidence about the future, that you’ll have to make it happen. Start drawing up those resolutions today.

"
2 january 2017,aquarius,"This is no time to wait for job offers and boatloads of cash to just show up magically at your door, Aquarius! Forget winning lotto numbers and raffle tickets too. The cosmos is telling you to make things happen with your finances, and you need to be vocal about it. Ask for the job, the raise, the order, the deal, or the opportunity. You don’t ask, you don’t get.

"
3 january 2017,aquarius,"It’s time to dispel any fears or concerns you have about romantic matters. This isn’t to suggest that life is rosy and that everything is perfect. But with so many planets in your house of security, you need answers, and the only way you’re going to get them is to ask. If your partner isn’t willing to communicate then you may decide to find someone who will. And singles, your days of hanging out with bad boys and divas seem to be coming to an end. A far more practical mood is starting to set in.

"
4 january 2017,aquarius,"Group efforts should start to pick up steam in the week ahead, culminating in a full moon on the 12th. So in order for teams to work together effectively—whether it’s your wedding party or a departmental effort at the office—everyone needs to know their role and just as important, the budget! Mercury retrogrades today back into your house of networking, so if anyone is slacking or unsure about what to do next, they need some direction.

"
5 january 2017,aquarius,"Loose lips sink ships and you need to make sure that the good ship Aquarius  doesn’t go down like the Titanic today. With the Sun and Pluto churning up the waters of your subconscious mind between now and the weekend, fears and negative emotions may be swirling in your mind. And while this is actually a helpful situation as it will eventually enable you to release toxic patterns (and people), a very emotional Moon-Uranus aspect could cause you to blurt something out that you might regret later. This is a recurring theme, and you also need to keep your lips zipped on the 10th, 11th and 31st. Start going within to find peace—and answers.

"
6 january 2017,aquarius,"This is good time to make plans with friends and solidify any activities going on with other groups, such as a volunteer effort, the PTO, your church, an industry group or a family party. You’ll be able to make even more progress next week. Your eleventh house of camaraderie is being activated, which makes for some good times. And you also might be interested to know that this sector governs your fondest hopes and wishes, so get as clear about them as you can.

"
7 january 2017,aquarius,"Pluto is the planet of metamorphosis, the orb that seeks out weaknesses and problems so that they can be addressed and eliminated. Today is one of the most transformative days of 2017 as Pluto meets up with the Sun, which will shine its light on what you need to work on. They meet up in the house of the subconscious mind, so this is all about doing inner work, Aquarius. What toxic ties or circumstances need to be cut? Are there bad habits that are holding you back, such as substance abuse or a constant flow of negative thoughts in your head? While it’s never easy to prune the dead wood from our minds, here’s a piece of good news; Mercury goes direct tomorrow in your sector of big dreams and wishes. So take out the “trash” in order to bring in the good stuff of life.

"
8 january 2017,aquarius,"The cosmos is getting ready to help you move forward with matters at the workplace, as Thursday’s full moon should put an end to delays and infighting at the office. Fortunately Mercury resumes direct motion today in your house of teamwork and technology, so a great way to get the momentum building is to update computer systems and reevaluate the roles people play in a group effort. On a personal level some of your deepest wishes may also start to manifest, perhaps slowly, but any progress is good progress!

"
9 january 2017,aquarius,"When things go wrong and relationships fall apart in Hollywood, “creative differences” are usually cited as the cause. And that’s what you may be dealing with today at the office or in a romance: differences of opinion about the path a certain project or relationship is taking. While this doesn’t spell doom and gloom for your alliances, it does  mean that your patience will be tested over the next few days, especially at the time of Thursday’s full moon. Make sure that you’re not doing all of the “heavy lifting” in a partnership or group effort.

"
10 january 2017,aquarius,"You’re such a gregarious sign that you don’t expect others to be sullen and moody, but that’s what you might be dealing with over the next few days. Don’t let anyone rain on your parade, Aquarius! The problem is that with the Sun in one of the most sensitive parts of your chart, you could easily take offense. Let this pass and hang with the people who have your back.

"
11 january 2017,aquarius,"Practicality rules with a sturdy Mars-Pluto aspect that will help bring more security into your life. The key to working with the energy of the cosmos these days is to keep things real: budget, strategize, assign responsibilities to others, and develop good habits for yourself. The rose colored glasses need to go, and realistic timelines need to be applied to your endeavors. Do that and you’ll be looking at success over the next six months.

"
12 january 2017,aquarius,"Yowza! That little brain of yours is firing on all cylinders, Aquarius. With the full moon in your house of efficiency and getting things done, and Mercury entering your intuition sector, both the right and left sides of your noggin are cooking. Add Jupiter into the mix, which is coaxing you into considering grand visions and plans, and the stage is set for Too. Much. Thinking. But I suppose this is better than having no ideas whatsoever about where you’re headed! Just try to take it slow and deal with one idea or project at a time. When the new moon occurs in your sign in two weeks, you’ll be in a much better place to clarify your agenda.

"
13 january 2017,aquarius,"With so much planetary activity taking place in practical houses, no one would blame you for wanting to unplug. And considering that the Moon is now in luxury-loving Leo, this weekend is the perfect time for treating yourself to some goodies: a night out on the town, a massage, a mani-pedi or a sparkling bottle of champagne. The work will still be there on Monday–forget about it for now.

"
14 january 2017,aquarius,"Your birthday season is approaching, Aquarius, and it’s time to start cleaning house—figuratively, that is. Intelligent Mercury just entered your house of closure, encouraging you to cut ties with people and situations that have reached their sell-by date. You may have discovered recently that not everyone shares the same opinions as you, nor do they seem to be on the same path. If that’s the case you may have some decisions to make, as a secure future is becoming increasingly important to you.

"
15 january 2017,aquarius,"You’re searching for direction or answers, but they may not come easily today, or tomorrow either for that matter. Is it any surprise that you want to know the scoop? Your birthday season kicks off this Thursday and it would be helpful to have a road map for the next year. That’s OK. Sit tight and wait til Wednesday when clarity starts to return.

"
16 january 2017,aquarius,"We all need to do inner work and today a happy Moon-Pluto aspect will enable you to do just that. Consider which parts of your psyche need healing, then determine to take care of them. Whether you meditate, talk to a therapist or take a long walk in the woods, find a modality that works. With the Sun entering your sign on Thursday any old baggage that’s been weighing you down needs to be kicked to the curb.

"
17 january 2017,aquarius,"It’s time to examine your attitude about earning money and saving it, as the planets are focusing a lot of energy on this part of your chart. With Mars in your house of self-esteem you’re probably very motivated to increase your net worth, but first you need to be honest with yourself. Emotional spending and running up too much credit card debt has to go.

"
18 january 2017,aquarius,"Scale back? No doubt you’re ready to see progress, thanks to megawatt Mars blasting through your house of income and self-esteem. But you may be trying to do too much in too little time, or planning grandiose schemes without the good habits to make them happen. Today is excellent for analyzing your methods and projections. You may need to do less in order to achieve more.

"
19 january 2017,aquarius,"Happy birthday, Aquarius! The Sun enters your sign today, showering you with cosmic attention for the next four weeks. But despite the celebratory mood, you seem to be unsure about what’s going on with the people around you: friends, colleagues at the office, or groups that you’re a member of. There is some static among these folks, and the question is—do you want to be a part of it? Sometimes it’s better to stand back and go solo, something that may sound a bit odd with your birthday season under way. It’s OK though, because once energetic Mars enters Aries on the 28th, you can swing back into the social scene.

"
20 january 2017,aquarius,"Woo-hoo! It’s your time in the Sun, Aquarius. If you’re trying to figure out which dream to go after first, why not consider your career and earning more? Red hot Mars is now in this part of your chart for the first time in two years. It will only be there till the 28th, so the next eight days are super for job hunts, asking for a raise or boosting your company’s revenues.

"
21 january 2017,aquarius,"Are you getting paid what you’re worth, or are you settling for crumbs? The desire to earn more—and  to be recognized in your field—could hit you hard today as the passionate Moon stokes this part of your chart. It forms a cleansing trine with Chiron, telling you to release any feelings of worthlessness. The new moon in your sign on the 27th is a confidence builder: don’t hold back.

"
22 january 2017,aquarius,"Aquarians are known as the most social of all the signs, and now that the Sun is in your first house it’s the perfect time to socialize and meet new people. It would also be wise to connect with a mentor, coach or savvy expert who can help guide you. A series of eclipses begins this year in Aquarius, meaning that there are BIG changes ahead. Make sure you’re ready for them.

"
23 january 2017,aquarius,"If a group project is going off the rails, you may need to be the person who will speak up and set things straight. The presence of unreliable Neptune indicates that others may be unwilling to so their share of the work, or fail to stick to a budget. Neither is acceptable. But you’re best off pulling some strings behind the scenes rather than confronting someone about their flaky attitude.

"
24 january 2017,aquarius,"Inspiration flows like wine today thanks to a heady meet up of dreamy Neptune and intelligent Mercury. The best part about this aspect is that you won’t be in airy-fairy land, conjuring up crazy ass fantasies that will never work! Nope, there’s an air of practicality involved in this meeting, so be prepared to think creatively and to act rationally.

"
25 january 2017,aquarius,"There’s a time to hustle and a time to slow down and the cosmos urges you to take a break—at least for a day or two! This includes shutting off the “monkey mind” in which thoughts are constantly hopping around in your poor brain like a crazed chimpanzee. The ability to still your conscious mind will be an important attribute in the week ahead. Mindfulness training, anyone?

"
26 january 2017,aquarius,"The new moon in Aquarius is on its way, which is like your annual New Year’s Eve event. But before it arrives tomorrow the cosmos asks that you temper some of your big ideas with practicality. Generous Jupiter is in your high-flying ninth house of being bold and optimistic. Venus is in the house that deals with realistic plans, such as budgets and time management. These two are having a conversation today about the way in which you’ll go after your passion projects, and from the way it looks, you’ll have just the right amount of logic and enthusiasm.

"
27 january 2017,aquarius,"Yee-ha!! The Aquarian new moon sparkles in the heavens, putting your needs and desires front and center. However, there’s an odd mix of aspects that deals with how much you should be sharing with others. Mercury and Pluto are encouraging you to work behind the scenes on new endeavors, whether it’s a diet, book proposal or career decision. On the other hand, Saturn and Jupiter suggest finding a mentor or friend who can provide you with advice and guidance. How to finesse this? Be circumspect about what you share and with whom. Create a small master mind group to rely on.

"
28 january 2017,aquarius,"Aquarius, you are no shrinking violet. Yesterday’s new moon in your sign opened up a six-month period of focusing on your desires and plans. And today, megawatt Mars enters your ever-so-vocal third house of self-expression. The time is ripe for meeting people, discussing your ideas, planning the next steps to take, taking a class, flirting and dating, and working on the marketing/social media part of a business plan. Stand up for yourself and expand your contact list.

"
29 january 2017,aquarius,"Friday’s new moon fell in Aquarius, highlighting your self-image and kicking off an important six-month cycle in which you can go after just about any ambition. But today subterranean Pluto and intelligent Mercury are holding a meeting, suggesting that before your plunge into new activities that you do a little quiet thinking first. Are you holding yourself back with fear, grudges or past traumas? Do you have any bad habits that need to be addressed before you move ahead? Is your physical health up to par? Take an assessment and make the necessary changes, then dig in.

"
30 january 2017,aquarius,"Stop worrying about what other people think and let your own wisdom be your guide. With intelligent Mercury in your house of intuition you should have no trouble with that, providing you slow down long enough to hear that small still voice from within. It’s a powerful day to pick up inspirational and creative ideas too.

"
31 january 2017,aquarius,"Mixed signals fill the air waves, Aquarius! No, Mercury isn’t retrograde but he’s in a tussle with erratic Uranus. This is not a good day for making big decisions as your intuition and logical mind are at war with each other. Furthermore, you can’t necessarily trust the advice of other people. Wait a few days before making your next move.

"
1 february 2017,aquarius,"Ouch! The pen is mightier than the sword and your words might cut like a knife today, Aquarius. Be careful what you say and to whom, as a difficult Moon-Jupiter aspect could push your emotional buttons, making you say (or text) words that you’ll regret later. Wait till Friday if you need to vent. Gentle Venus glides into your communication sector, softening your tone.

"
2 february 2017,aquarius,"Pay attention to that small voice inside that’s telling you to take a chance on something. With Mars in your comfort driven house of domesticity you could be digging in your heels, thinking that you need to stay put–in a particular job, relationship, town or family responsibility. Not so! You don’t have to chuck it all but you can take a few calculated risks.

"
3 february 2017,aquarius,"A far more social period opens up in your life today thanks to Venus entering your third house of socializing. But while you’re brunching and enjoying cocktails, slow down a bit as the cosmos indicates that you’re trying to do too much in too little time. The next month is perfect for taking three-day weekends and getting out of town to a nearby destination, so plan a mini vacay now!

"
4 february 2017,aquarius,"With so many planets focusing on the next big steps of your birthday year, it may be hard to pin down where to start. Today the emotional Moon shines its light on your home environment. Are you happy with where you live? Are you surrounded by beauty and comfort? Does everyone under your roof get along, not to mention your extended family? If not it’s time to make some changes. When Mercury enters Aquarius on Tuesday you’re going to become a lot more vocal about what you need.

"
5 february 2017,aquarius,"Don’t kid yourself about your finances, Aquarius. A difficult Moon-Neptune square indicates that you may be tempted to spend on unnecessary items. Jupiter is scheduled to retrograde tomorrow in your house of big thinking, demanding a more practical approach to all of your major plans. Many of the goodies we want in life have a price tag attached—make sure that you’re saving up to cover them.

"
6 february 2017,aquarius,"Yes, you’re the celestial favorite right now and yes, it’s your birthday season. The Sun in Aquarius may be making you feel like a kid in a candy shop as you consider all of the possibilities ahead. The problem is that abundant Jupiter slows down in your house of expansion for the next four months. This doesn’t mean that you can’t have any fun or that you’ll be denied opportunities, but it does mean that you have to be realistic with timetables. You might also have to create a short list of what activities you’re going to take on first and get to the rest over the summer.

"
7 february 2017,aquarius,"Your birthday season picks up more steam today, Aquarius, thanks to energetic Mercury entering your sign! Chances are you’re going to be more assertive and start to feel like yourself again. It’s a great time to revamp your image, too, whether it’s your appearance or a change in attitude. In August a series of eclipses are going to start in your sign; your life will change in ways that you may not even be able to imagine right now.

"
8 february 2017,aquarius,"Sometimes the best thing to say is nothing, especially if you’re surrounded by people who defend their bad behavior (slacking, whining, diva tantrums) with indefensible logic. The problem, Aquarius, is that you have several planets in highly opinionated, verbal houses. But today there are too many tense aspects in the heavens that advise against expressing yourself. Wait until tomorrow when a silky Venus-Mercury aspect allows for better communication.

"
9 february 2017,aquarius,"Go tell it from the mountain! Spontaneous Uranus is in your verbal sector, and it could prompt you to be loud and proud today. And so what? Your opinion should  be heard. You’re an Aquarius and the Sun is in your house of self. The end.

"
10 february 2017,aquarius,"Put a ring on it! Tonight’s eclipse in Leo is designed to take a romantic relationship to the next level—or not. Eclipses are game changers, bringing about fast change. As this is a lunar eclipse it will shine its light on a close relationship, essentially making this a big decision moment. Many Aquarians will get engaged, move in together or make future plans that solidify their union. Is it possible that you could part ways? Maybe, if things haven’t been going well. But it’s not likely as this lunation is surrounded by a bevy of helpful planets. Exciting new business collaborations could also be on the horizon, and they could end up being grand in scale.

"
11 february 2017,aquarius,"While the recent lunar eclipse may find you questioning your role in a partnership, today’s happy Sun-Jupiter aspect is going to fire up your optimism, sense of spontaneity and enterprising spirit. Over the next eight months you’ll be a heck of a lot more interested in following your own path, one that’s more rewarding than those you’ve trod in the past. Who will travel with you on your journey? That’s for you to decide.

"
12 february 2017,aquarius,"Avoid making major financial decisions as this week begins as a confusing Moon-Neptune aspect indicates that you may not have all of the facts. Worse, someone may be concealing them. There’s no need to go Rambo on anyone whom you think may be playing games. Just wait until Thursday when a smart Sun-Saturn angle shines its light on the situation.

"
13 february 2017,aquarius,"How much passion do you have toward life? Are you just going through the motions or do you look forward to what the day has in store? Today a helpful Moon-Sun aspect lets you get in touch with your emotions and passion. Get ready to take a chance because the energy tomorrow is all about going after your dreams.

"
14 february 2017,aquarius,"With both the Sun and magnetic Mercury in your sign, your charisma factor is pretty darn high this Valentine’s Day! Better yet is that stable Saturn is in a terrific angle, helping you focus on your deepest desires. Singles should hit the social scene tonight with Mars and Venus both in your convivial house of networking, and coupled up Aquarians should be out on the town too. It’s the perfect time to hold serious talks, by the way.

"
15 february 2017,aquarius,"Slow down there, Aquarius. Mars is turning you into the mother of all social butterflies. Your brain is probably going “snap, crackle, pop” with ideas besides. All of this is lovely, but it may cause you to leap into associations or projects without much thought. Curb your enthusiasm and create a short list of the activities you want to partake in, otherwise you’ll burn yourself out.

"
16 february 2017,aquarius,"It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it. Assertive Mars in your communication sector is putting the right words in your mouth, so stick up for yourself, share your brilliant ideas and network like crazy.

"
17 february 2017,aquarius,"The toughest thing you’ll have to do over the next week is to create a short list of all the adventures and projects you’d like to dive into. Mercury is in your sign, stirring up your imagination and desire to explore new things. But are you afraid that career and other obligations will hold you back? They won’t unless you let them!

"
18 february 2017,aquarius,"Your confidence should start to rise now that the mighty Sun is in your house of increased income. Better yet is the solar eclipse in this part of the sky that will take place on the 26th, the last one in a series that has been designed to take you out of a sparse financial situation. But nothing is going to happen magically on its own—you’ll have to put in some effort. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

"
19 february 2017,aquarius,"Quite impressive! You’re in an excellent spot to dazzle others this week, thanks to eloquent Mercury in your sign. Today and tomorrow the energy is ripe for discussing your biggest dreams and wishes with the people who can help make them happen. Whether it’s a job recruiter, banker, your lover or a trusted friend, share your ideas with other for both making progress and receiving feedback.

"
20 february 2017,aquarius,"Don’t hold back! It’s wise to express your opinion today, even if it throws others off their game. Your goal is not to insult or create drama; the cosmos just wants your voice to be heard. This entire week is excellent for self-expression, except  Wednesday when you really need to keep your lips zipped.

"
21 february 2017,aquarius,"You’re in a pretty expansive mood these days, Aquarius, thanks to lucky Jupiter stirring up your open-hearted, spontaneous house of big possibilities. The problem is that some malcontents in your midst may want to burst your bubble. But your attitude is too upbeat for them to succeed with their Grinch-like maneuvers.

"
22 february 2017,aquarius,"No matter how tempted you may be to speak your mind, the planets warn that discretion must be your #1 goal today. A tense Mars-Pluto standoff indicates that someone in your midst may not have your best interests at heart. The problem is that they may keep their opposition under wraps, so while you’re blabbing away, they’re taking mental notes–and then strategizing how to block you.

"
23 february 2017,aquarius,"Long term connections can be forged today, whether it’s a romantic union or an iron clad business deal. With chatty Mercury in a sweet spot, talk things over with the people who count. It’s also an auspicious time to make new friendships and to join groups of like minded people, such as a volunteer organization. You’re entering into a more mature, stable time period and the company you keep will reflect that.

"
24 february 2017,aquarius,"You have the gift of gab today with a cheeky Moon-Venus aspect, so use it to charm and beguile. This is also a good weekend for some makeover magic as luxe Venus is in your house of self-expression. Consider how to update your look and then get moving. A visit to a spa is a nice way to start!

"
25 february 2017,aquarius,"Believing in yourself is one of the best things you can do to improve your financial situation, Aquarius, and that should be easier now that intelligent Mercury is in your house of income. Put yourself in a position to be noticed by decision makers. You have the talent–showcase it.

"
26 february 2017,aquarius,"One last push? Today’s solar eclipse in your money house is the last one in a series that started a few years ago. If you’ve been hard at work, trying to close deals, switch to a new occupation or land a promotion, then continue to hustle between now and August. Sell yourself and don’t be shy about it.

"
27 february 2017,aquarius,"Truth or dare? You’d better be telling the truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God, with an ornery Mars-Jupiter opposition. This is not a good day to bulls**t your way through a situation, nor is it wise to be way too opinionated. Attention all of you Aquarians who have been bottling up your feelings: they could explode today. Consider yourself warned, and consider the consequences.

"
28 february 2017,aquarius,"Your sign is known for its open friendliness, but sometimes being easy to read can work against you. That’s the case today. While I’m not suggesting that you lie or engage in flattery, you don’t have to tell others everything that you’re thinking or planning to do. Reveal the barest minimum and keep your most important thoughts and ideas to yourself.

"
1 march 2017,aquarius,"Your self-esteem gets a healthy boost today from the cosmos, thanks to a cordial meeting of the Sun and inspirational Neptune. In the days ahead your mind may open to new possibilities, things that will give you a greater sense of enjoying life while remaining proud of your accomplishments. FYI: some of this newfound confidence could come from a higher paying job. Consider your options.

"
2 march 2017,aquarius,"Sshhh! Discretion is the watchword as a tough aspect in the heavens warns against speaking out—no matter how convinced you are that your opinion is just fine, thank you very much. Needless to say, trolling, ranting and gossiping can and will backfire against you. It’s not worth it. Just because you think something doesn’t mean that you should say it.

"
3 march 2017,aquarius,"Security conscious? A number of planetary aspects starting today and continuing over the next week will help you get a handle on your finances as well as your personal relationships. An added benefit is the presence of subterranean Pluto in your house of intuition, which will enable you to see behind facades and agendas. Listen more than you talk and don’t jump to conclusions.

"
4 march 2017,aquarius,"Slow down and think before you speak, Aquarius. No, Mercury isn’t retrograde but Venus is—in your house of communication no less. This could create arguments, sulking and the sense that you’re not being appreciated by others. Your thoughts create your emotions, which then lead to your actions. In order to feel resentful, for example, you first need to think disempowering thoughts that will create the resentment. Be wary of going into this moody place too often between now and April 2nd.

"
5 march 2017,aquarius,"They say that people make the world go ’round, and nothing could be truer for you today, Aquarius. A super Mars-Saturn meet up encourages you to reach out to friends and colleagues, old bosses and folks who would make great mentors. Work that contact list–and have some fun along the way!

"
6 march 2017,aquarius,"They say that “talk is cheap” but not for you this week, Aquarius. This is one of your best times all year to ask for a raise, schedule a job interview or develop a new income stream. A meeting today between intelligent Mercury and the Sun will help you come up with ideas. Don’t wait–run with them over the rest of the week.

"
7 march 2017,aquarius,"If you’re expecting cooperation from others today, Aquarius, you may not get it! People at home or work may be in major slacking mode, so don’t wait for them if you need to make progress. This doesn’t mean, however, that you should let them walk all over you. Tomorrow is a good day to set boundaries, even if they’re personal, confidential ones.

"
8 march 2017,aquarius,"Developing a firmer foundation both in love and your finances is the goal of the cosmos, Aquarius. Today is a good time to reflect upon changes you need to make, habits that could be improved, and thought patterns that might be holding you back from enjoying the comfort you deserve. The full moon on the 12th will put all of this in sharp focus, opening up a six-month chapter in which you can make enormous progress. But you have to be in the right mindset first.

"
9 march 2017,aquarius,"There are three houses that govern your emotions, and all of them are loaded with planetary action—so beware of meltdowns! Mars enters your house of security today, which quite frankly could make you more emo than usual. A full moon is coming next week in your intimacy and libido sector (another mine field), and subterranean Pluto is stirring up your intuition and deepest thoughts. This could end up being the perfect storm or the perfect opportunity to work on your sense of contentment and serenity.

"
10 march 2017,aquarius,"You’ll be feeling like a team player, which is a good thing for your love life, family relations and office environment. Don’t worry, you’re not going to end up being a doormat, With the feisty Sun and intelligent Mercury in your responsibility and routines zone, no one will be able to dump their s*** on you. Just make an effort today to play nice with others.

"
11 march 2017,aquarius,"Pay close attention to facts and figures along with the bigger picture. Optimistic Jupiter is helping you think on grand terms…perhaps a little too grand for your budget these days! With tomorrow’s full moon in your finance sector, building a solid fiscal foundation is the name of the game.

"
12 march 2017,aquarius,"What a perfect day for dreaming! I’m not talking about fantasy-fueled escapist escapades, but a creative visualization session. Think long and hard about the future, Pisces, as a full moon in the sector that governs passion. What is it that you desire in love? Your career? What kind of “toys” do you want to possess, such as luxury real estate or cars? The Sun in your grounded second house will help you come up with concrete plans for making these things a reality.

"
13 march 2017,aquarius,"Speak up! Now that Mercury is in your house of communication you can really get your point across, especially to family members or a lover. With yesterday’s full moon in your house of passion and intimacy, clearing the air with your amour should be first on your agenda.

"
14 march 2017,aquarius,"No one likes surprises when it comes to launching big plans—like your wedding, that European vacation, an online store or presenting your thesis. The cosmos urges you to go over all the details today to make sure that you’ve got everything covered. While you’re at it, assess the players who are involved—is everyone supporting you? Don’t kid yourself. Take an honest assessment.

"
15 march 2017,aquarius,"Things may get tangled up in red tape as the week goes on, but at least you know what needs to be done–and by what deadline! A strong Moon-Saturn aspect helps you define the direction a project or idea should be heading in. Try to get your point across to others, but don’t be surprised if they drag their feet and can’t reach a consensus.

"
16 march 2017,aquarius,"You’ll have no shortage of ideas when it comes to spending money, and fortunately innovative Neptune will help you dream up more ways to earn it. Let the creative machinery of your mind get to work on the earning and savings portion. Once the Sun moves into Aries next week you’ll be able to turn brainstorms into actual strategies.

"
17 march 2017,aquarius,"Your financial picture needs some examining, Aquarius. Your bank account may not be matching your plans for the future. Serious Saturn tells you to either scale back your plans or save more before you continue. Long term plans may also be facing delays, especially if they require the cooperation of other people. Next week is a far better time to make progress.

18 march 2017,aquarius,"It’s time to speak up! A powwow between chatty Mercury and Venus sets the stage for getting things out of your brain and into the open. And this weekend is just the opening act. Once the Sun enters Aries on Monday you’ll have four weeks at your disposal in which to lecture, negotiate, learn, teach, write, strategize and socialize.

"
19 march 2017,aquarius,"Who is true blue? Think about the people in your life, be they personal connections or from your job. You’re about to enter a highly social period once the Sun enters Aries tomorrow. Serious Saturn urges you to cull the frenemies, malcontents and divas from your life before you start booking meetings, brunches and get togethers.

"
20 march 2017,aquarius,"Get ready for a busy month ahead, Aquarius–socializing, taking classes, running errands, finishing term papers, blogging, writing, communicating. The Sun has entered your chatty, brainy third house of communication and thinking. This is also an excellent time for negotiating contracts, applying for grants, and taking some quick trips out of town. Three day weekend anyone?

"
21 march 2017,aquarius,"With optimistic Jupiter in your house of taking risks for the first time in over a decade, you are being encouraged to go after some lofty goals. However, fears and negative thoughts like “I’m too old” or “I need security” may be holding you back. In addition, you could be too concerned about what others will think. No one said that you have to completely overhaul your life. Take a few baby steps and see where they take you.

"
22 march 2017,aquarius,"Over the next few days pay closer attention to what your gut tells you rather than what others say. It’s not that they’re trying to deceive you (although one or two of them might); it’s more a situation in which they don’t know what they’re talking about. Getting bombarded with unsolicited and ill-advised opinions won’t help you. Your own intuition will.

"
23 march 2017,aquarius,"Uh, does anyone here know what they’re doing? Confusion may abound—at home, work or anywhere else for that matter—as communications planet Mercury gets gobsmacked by Pluto. Chances are that you’ll be the most reasonable person in the room, thanks to intelligent Mercury in your house of thinking. But others may not be as logical, with some even playing the passive-aggressive game. Saturday is a better day to get through to people

"
24 march 2017,aquarius,"Big ideas and plans may have to be put on pause as you reconsider how to go about them. The good news is that you’re in a highly mental phase right now (think brainiac) due to the presence of the Sun, Venus and Mercury all sequestered in your intelligent third house. Solutions are there if you look for them, so take some time this weekend to ponder.

"
25 march 2017,aquarius,"Show your feelings. Better yet, let people know how much you love them. With magnetic, emotional Venus in a good angle this weekend, sharing your feelings and thoughts is well aspected. Speaking up for yourself at work and in your community is also favored after the new moon on Tuesday.

"
26 march 2017,aquarius,"Can we talk? A spontaneous meeting between chatty Mercury and maverick Uranus could spur a conversation that you may not have been expecting, but good nonetheless. A person you’re dating could admit that they’re in love. A family member may finally try to settle a squabble. You and someone else could hit upon a brilliant idea that could put a lot of cash in your pocket. Whatever discussions being today will continue over the next few weeks.

"
27 march 2017,aquarius,"Confusion regarding a family or romantic matter should clear up this week, thanks to assertive Mars in control of your domestic sector. There may be people in your midst who need to become aware that rules and routines are meant to be followed. Today is a good time to remind them of that, with love of course!

"
28 march 2017,aquarius,"Busy, busy! That’s going to be your MO in the months ahead as today’s new moon kicks off a social yet informative time. The lunation occurs in your third house of networking, errands, social action, nearby travel, education and self-expression. Got a blog, book or screenplay inside that brain of yours? Want to code an app or learn Photoshop? Then get moving, as you can make impressive headway by August.

"
29 march 2017,aquarius,"Network like nobody’s business today, Aquarius! The connections you make can pull strings or help you in ways that you can’t even imagine right now. This includes online dating, which (believe it or not) can be fruitful. Saturn, planet of maturity and long term relationships, is forming a trine—the best angle possible in astrology—to chatty Mercury, so work it.

"
30 march 2017,aquarius,"Slow down, Aquarius! You run the risk of trying to do too much too soon, thanks to optimistic Jupiter pushing you to get past your comfort zone. While you may indeed need to make a break from the past (also known as “getting out of a rut”), it seems that your batteries are a little low. Rest, recharge, then blast forward with confidence.

"
31 march 2017,aquarius,"A social time is opening up for you, thanks to the recent new moon in your chatty third house. And today Mercury buzzes in to your family sector, placing the focus on them. Over the next few weeks you should be spending more quality time with the kids, siblings, a lover, your parents and the neighbors. Business can wait, and to a certain extent so can your friends. It’s also an auspicious time to start some spring cleaning and gardening.

"
1 april 2017,aquarius,"It’s time to stop worrying about other people and to get in touch with your own emotions, Aquarius! Now that Mercury is in your sensitive house of nurturing and feeling secure, you need to indulge in some extreme self care. Pamper yourself, create a home that feels like a spa and spend some quiet time with your thoughts and feelings.

"
2 april 2017,aquarius,"Get your priorities straight about money, Aquarius, as profitable Venus will demand that you focus on this part of your life into mid-April. Next week’s full moon falls in the most expansive part of your chart, encouraging you to take some risks. But before you do, make sure that there is a solid bedrock of cash beneath you.

"
3 april 2017,aquarius,"The planets are inspiring you to become more organized by creating more efficient routines and habits, the kinds that could even put more money in your pocket. However, this may have an effect on your personal life in some way. For example, if you decide to cut back on alcohol, you may see less of your friends. Or you realize that certain connections are holding you back from getting your chores done or getting to bed early enough. Run with what works for you.

"
4 april 2017,aquarius,"You’re more than motivated to get things done but watch that you don’t get too pushy in the process. If you annoy someone whose help you need they won’t hesitate to give you a piece of their mind. With the Sun in your opinionated third house you could come across as being brash or rather impressed with yourself. Slow down and respect others and their time.

"
5 april 2017,aquarius,"You enjoy being in the spotlight, and why not? But for you it’s not all ego and attention. You have something to say that people can benefit from, so don’t hold back. Show the world your talent and ideas.

"
6 april 2017,aquarius,"Team efforts, group activities and friendships may experience slowdowns now that Saturn is retrograde in your eleventh house of networking. It may be time to distance yourself from people or circumstances that don’t share your values or work ethic. This is no time to be a welcome mat, enabler or the good soldier. If others don’t hold up their end of a commitment you may have a decision to make.

"
7 april 2017,aquarius,"Step away from drama today as there may be plenty of people in your midst who want to create it. And you may want to slap on a headphone set too in order to avoid the egotistical rantings of people who think that everyone is entitled to their opinion. Oh, and by the way….you don’t want to be one of those obnoxious people yourself, do you? Stay humble and say little.

"
8 april 2017,aquarius,"What people say and what they mean could be two different things today. This could be in the business area as well as your closest relationships, so pay close attention to subtle cues that will tip you off to someone’s true agenda. Protect your interests and don’t be afraid to say no to anything that sounds “off”.

"
9 april 2017,aquarius,"If you’re smart you’ll use the planetary energy on offer over the next few weeks to take care of housing and family issues. Mercury just went retrograde in this sector, so patch up relations with your parents, get the landlord to fix the plumbing and make your kids clean their rooms. You have such light hearted energy taking place in other parts of your chart that you should be enjoying life without these things hanging over you.

"
10 april 2017,aquarius,"A battle is brewing between your optimistic side and the part of you that’s a bit negative or cautious. It will come to a head with tomorrow’s full moon in your adventurous, big-picture-thinking sector. The cosmos is encouraging you to take a calculated risk, but Pluto is acting up in your worry sector. It’s also possible that someone else may be placing fears in your mind. Follow your own judgment, not someone else’s opinion.

"
11 april 2017,aquarius,"Your ability to see possibilities where others cannot is extraordinary, Aquarius. Tonight’s full moon will help you take a gamble on a new job, relationship, move or adventure that will make your soul sing. But the people who cannot see your vision may balk, throwing up roadblocks or criticism. Be diplomatic but forge ahead nonetheless.

"
12 april 2017,aquarius,"Your self-esteem gets a nice boost from a happy Moon-Neptune connection. From your chart it appears that you may have been a bit down, selling yourself short and not realizing what wonderful qualities you have. That’s about o change, especially after Saturday when Venus resumes direct motion.

"
13 april 2017,aquarius,"Your reputation is a valuable asset, and today’s planetary aspects will help you enrich yours. What you say and do will count for a lot in the weeks ahead, so make sure that your actions and statements are impeccable. The best part is that your own sense of self-worth and dignity will rise along with your reputation.

"
14 april 2017,aquarius,"Tell it like it is, babe. With the sensible Sun meeting up with rebellious Uranus, it’s time to voice your opinion. You may have been hesitant to speak up over recent weeks, but now is the moment to be direct while still being respectful. If other people can’t take what you have to say, that’s their problem–not yours.

"
15 april 2017,aquarius,"Yessss! Profits planet Venus finally goes direct in your income sector, opening doors for making mo’ $$. You’re in quite a visionary place these days too, so now it’s time to take some of your best ideas and run with them. Things won’t take off overnight–not with all of the April retrogrades going on– but the next six months are some of the best ever for getting things started.

"
16 april 2017,aquarius,"Sometimes we need to be reminded about what’s important in life, and today a sweet Venus-Mars aspect does just that. Your relationship with loved ones will become more important in the weeks ahead, so why not start today by spending some quality time with them? Create some new traditions while you celebrate the old ones.

"
17 april 2017,aquarius,"Your words count for a lot today, so be measured in your speech. That’s because long-term-ramification Saturn is involved, indicating that the things you say and do have power and energy that can carry forward for years to come. This is an excellent day to make presentations and network; the more people, the better. You never know where some of these conversations will lead.

"
18 april 2017,aquarius,"Rely on logic today as the Moon may be drumming up fears that aren’t based on reality. If you suspect that someone is trying to get the upper hand or is somehow not being truthful, sit back and give them all the rope they need rather than being confrontational. You may discover that your fears are unfounded.

"
19 april 2017,aquarius,"Feeling secure and content is the order of the day now that the Sun is in your emotional fourth house. This sector governs your family, the place where you live and memories of the past. It’s a good time to do some inner work, releasing the parts of your life that may have hurt you as a child while cherishing the remembrances of the good times. It’s also auspicious for turning your abode into a cozy nest, a place that you love coming home to at night.

"
20 april 2017,aquarius,"You are entering one of the most healing chapters of the year thanks to two planets moving retrograde today. Both Mercury and Pluto start to backstroke in houses that govern mental health and the way in which you express yourself. This is an excellent time for seeking help, whether it’s via a therapist, a bereavement group, meditation or reading up on metaphysics. Not only will you start to feel more optimistic about life, but your creativity will flow.

"
21 april 2017,aquarius,"Honey, when you’ve got it, flaunt it! Lusty Mars sashays into your spicy fifth house of fun, flirting and romance, its first visit here in two years. You’re in a great spot to find new love or jazz up an existing relationship. But there’s a warning attached: Mars can stir up drama and jealousy when it’s here. Furthermore, Pluto just went retro in your moody house of the subconscious mind which can drum up fears and toxic remembrances from the past. The key: don’t rush into new relationships, and avoid making the same kinds of mistakes you’ve made before in love, whether you’re single or already attached.

"
22 april 2017,aquarius,"One of the best ways to ensure that there is stability in any relationship—family, romantic, business, volunteer work—is to determine if you’re on the same page as the other person. A tough Venus-Saturn aspect warns to not kid yourself about this. Get real about shared visions and values, don’t put anyone on a pedestal and don’t tell yourself that things will change one fine day. Next week is excellent for doing some digging on this topic.

"
23 april 2017,aquarius,"If you need to have The Talk—you know, the one that asks where this relationship is going—today’s a good time to do so. Likewise, having a discussion about anything that’s important to the stability of a relationship is well favored. This vibe continues into the week, so don’t feel that you need to get a firm answer today.

"
24 april 2017,aquarius,"Some promising new contacts can be made today, so by all means reach out to people whom you’d like to get to know better. With serious Saturn in the mix, some of the folks you meet could be in your life for decades to come: a potential spouse, a new, tried and true best friend, savvy business colleagues and folks who share the same hobbies and interests. Charitable and volunteer activities are also well favored, so give back to the world and meet some terrific people in the process.

"
25 april 2017,aquarius,"A happy time is about to begin with tomorrow’s new moon in one of the most emotional parts of your chart. This is the house of family and love, but the planets are also encouraging you to make more friends and to get out there and mingle more. Spontaneous Uranus could bring some new introductions your way, so be open minded and ready to let some new people into your world.

"
26 april 2017,aquarius,"Feeling like a social butterfly? You will be, thanks to a bevy of planetary influences all activating the people-centric parts of your chart. But this isn’t just about heading off to cocktail parties and brunches. Sure, you can start booking those dates but leave time for family and loved ones as the new moon occurs in your cozy house of nesting. And don’t forget to set aside some down time for yourself.

"
27 april 2017,aquarius,"Pluto is the planet that plumbs the subterranean depths, and it happens to be retrograde in the house that governs your subconscious mind. This could be a pretty heavy placement but today the dwarf planet is in a helpful mood. It joins up with the emotional Moon to help build a more solid psychological foundation for you. You know best what inner work needs to be done, so don’t delay.

"
28 april 2017,aquarius,"Closeness counts now that Venus is in your highly social third house. Get tighter with your friends, a lover or even your neighbors as magnetic Venus helps you chat, brunch and hold some deep discussions. Spontaneous Uranus is in a good mood, so don’t be surprised if someone calls you out of the blue. Singles could meet a new hottie while out and about.

"
29 april 2017,aquarius,"Be wary of putting someone on a pedestal, Aquarius, or thinking more highly of them than they deserve. The Moon may be fogging up your brain with happy-happy thinking. Keep it real. It’s wonderful to have positive thoughts but if your intuition is off, you could easily be led astray.

"
30 april 2017,aquarius,"Believe it to not, you might actually get motivated to get some grunt work done around the house over the next few days. The Sun is in your domestic sector, a boon for creating a more cozy nest. Start pulling things together at your place as it appears that you have a very social time ahead. You don’t want to waste valuable fun time this summer cleaning out the garage, do you?

"
1 may 2017,aquarius,"A colleague or client could set you off today with a rude remark or diva-like attitude. The same goes for people in the world of “customer service” who have no intention of serving you, the customer, with respect! You don’t like having your time wasted with this nonsense either, but the planets tell you to count to ten. Mercury is retrograde in your communication sector til Wednesday and you might blow your top. Just breathe.

"
2 may 2017,aquarius,"Your love life gets a boost from a happy meeting of the passionate Moon and lusty, affectionate Mars, always a good thing! Mercury has been retrograde in your third house of communication, which could have been creating hurt feelings or drama. Start patching things up today because Mercury resumes direct motion tomorrow.

"
3 may 2017,aquarius,"Say “hallelujah”, say “amen”: Mercury resumes direct motion in your third house of thinking, writing and speaking. Of all the signs you may have been affected the most as this intelligent little planet governs self-expression. Negotiations, discussions, strategizing, socializing—all of these should become easier in the weeks ahead. With next week’s full moon occurring in your career house, now’s the smart time to start shopping your resume or dazzling decision makers.

"
4 may 2017,aquarius,"It’s not always easy to find the right words to say, especially when you’re with someone close. Or, spilling some deep thoughts that have been hidden inside for so long. But it should become easier today as a helpful Moon-Venus aspect helps to let the words and ideas flow. Next Wednesday is another awesome day to speak your piece, so if you’re not ready today then you still have another chance.

"
5 may 2017,aquarius,"Happiness at home may be on your mind these days, thanks to the Sun in your domestic zone. Fortunately an optimistic Sun-Jupiter aspect paves the way for good times and better relationships. A family vacation or reunion may be in the works, so consider some of your options— Disney, a big party this summer or the year end holidays at your place. Singles, reconsider the kind of person you want in your life, as Jupiter is pushing you to take a risk.

"
6 may 2017,aquarius,"You might be filled with a lot of adventurous energy this weekend, but what about the people around you? Chances are you’ll feel like the only one who knows how to have a good time or willing to take some risks. If that’s the case the pursuit of happiness may be a solo endeavor. Either that, or you need to make some new friends.

"
7 may 2017,aquarius,"Life’s too short to sit at home watching TV and the cosmos wants you to get out there and see the world. With a full moon approaching in your success sector, you could end up traveling for business or watching your brand reach people on the other side of the planet. Your earning power is increasing too, so set some cash aside for adventures.

"
8 may 2017,aquarius,"Open mouth, insert foot? Unless you want to end up eating your words you need to be careful today, Aquarius! The emotional Moon may provoke you to speak your opinion, which in and of itself is not a bad thing. But the moon opposes Mercury, indicating that the other person on the receiving end of your comments may not take kindly to them. This energy builds as Wednesday approaches, by the way, so you’ll need to tread warily for the next 72 hours.

"
9 may 2017,aquarius,"Planetary aspects are urging you to heal your tired mind, body and soul, Aquarius, whatever it takes: a nice long vacation, a massage at the spa, a serious discussion with a loved one or cutting yourself off from stressors. The Sun is shining its light on where improvement needs to be made and Pluto is taking a no-nonsense, let’s-get-this-done approach. With tomorrow’s full moon in the most ambitious part of your chart you need to lighten your load before charging ahead.

"
10 may 2017,aquarius,"Your career prospects skyrocket courtesy of tonight’s full moon in the most ambitious part of your chart. If you’ve been trying to land a more prestigious position, a raise or a new gig the cosmos has your back. That goes as well for those of who who may have been laid off and are looking for employment. The key for all Aquarians is to promote yourself like crazy, as Mercury is in a terrific spot to help you. Unpredictable Uranus is active too, indicating that news could come your way—good news—about something you weren’t expecting. By the way, this lunation is fabulous for all of your goals, not just career, so strategize, brainstorm and talk yourself up.

"
11 may 2017,aquarius,"Take your sweet time in matters of the heart, Aquarius. It doesn’t matter if you just started dating someone or you and the SO are talking about having another baby. A difficult Mars-Neptune square creates confusion, which is certainly not helpful when it comes to making key decisions. Your future security is at stake here. Singles, don’t plunge headlong into a romance before knowing more about your new flame. Attached Aquarians need to make sure that there will be guarantees ahead, such as an engagement ring or enough money to pay for the house or baby. Keep it real, as unromantic as that may sound.

"
12 may 2017,aquarius,"What’s the rush? You could be in a big one today, but I’m not talking about racing to work. This is more about trying to overhaul your life in a very short period of time. It’s one thing to be motivated, it’s another to be so driven that you dive headlong into a new situation without giving things the thought they deserve. That said, this is an excellent time to make tracks with a plan. Just make sure that you understand the risks as well as the rewards.

"
13 may 2017,aquarius,"You may need to take more control over a family situation or a group activity, Aquarius. Strong man Pluto is telling you to not get run over by the people around you. There is only so much you should be doing for others; at some point they have to figure things out for themselves. It may be a simple matter of setting some boundaries, as the cosmos wants you to take more time for yourself.

"
14 may 2017,aquarius,"Your opinion certainly counts, but is everyone around you ready to hear it? A tense aspect arriving toward the end of the week warns against being too vocal. So  if you need to get something off your chest, do it today while the cosmos has your back. You may need to soften your approach but at least you’ll have the chance to vent.

"
15 may 2017,aquarius,"Moody much? Pluto’s current position could be stirring up all sorts of emotions, especially those dealing with security. The good news is that once Mercury changes signs on Tuesday you’ll be able to come to grips with the things and people, past and present, that may be making you feel as though you don’t have a strong enough foundation. Keep your thoughts to yourself, though, or share them only with a close confidante.

"
16 may 2017,aquarius,"The ties that bind us to others will be the focus now that perceptive Mercury is in your house of loved ones, nostalgia and comfort. If a family battle has been dragging on now’s the time to end it. The same goes for issues with a lover, kids or an ex with whom you share custody. The good news is that the Sun enters your very  enjoyable fifth house of love, fun, children and creativity this Saturday for a four-week stay. Try to get matters resolved before then if you can.

"
17 may 2017,aquarius,"You’ve got some pretty firm ideas in your head these days, not being influenced easily by others. And that’s a good thing! Today the passionate Moon forms a terrific link with optimistic Jupiter, expanding your mind even further. Will everyone in your world be thrilled with your opinions and plans? Probably not, but that’s their problem. You may get pushback this Friday but don’t let that stop you.

"
18 may 2017,aquarius,"Getting people to reach a consensus today could be almost impossible, courtesy of a Venus-Jupiter opposition in the heavens. There may be lots of chatter that sounds nice and appears to be productive, but is there any meat in there? It’s not that people are trying to deceive you; it’s just that they may be thinking in grandiose terms, doing more dreaming than strategizing. Make sure that you’re not guilty of this yourself!

"
19 may 2017,aquarius,"Your sign is not known for flying solo, usually seeking the camaraderie of others in your personal life as well as business. Which is a good thing as a stellar Saturn-Uranus aspect urges you to join forces with others in the months ahead. If you’re already part of a team effort, some surprising and positive news could arrive. The next six months are also highly auspicious for tech efforts, finding a mentor and online dating.

"
20 may 2017,aquarius,"Ahh, sweet love. The Sun is now in your fifth house of romance, flirting and enjoying the more savory side of life. It’s time for singles to be out shopping for a beau or a belle, while coupled up Aquarians add more spice to their union. However, stern Saturn is warning you from the sidelines to make sure that you share the same values with your amour. This is no time for rose colored glasses thinking. At the same time your friends may be trying to spend more time with you, or butting into your life with unwanted opinions. Keep them in place, talk to your lover about the future and enjoy yourself.

"
21 may 2017,aquarius,"Considering that Thursday’s new moon falls in your house of romance, now’s the time to get ready for a new phase. And with the Moon today in your communication sector it would be wise to air any grievances and discuss long term plans. Singles who are looking for love should be working their contact list and going to as many local events as possible, as online dating isn’t auspicious right now.

"
22 may 2017,aquarius,"If you have something you want to say to someone, this is the day to do so, Aquarius. Lovely Venus sidles up to the Moon, making your words flow like honey. Trust me, this won’t be the case by Thursday as Pluto will be in a mood to strong arm people. Put your legendary charm to work while the skies are still clear!

"
23 may 2017,aquarius,"Lusty Mars is burning a swath through one of the most fun-loving parts of your chart, urging you to cut loose and enjoy life to the fullest. The only problem is that you may become too  flirtatious, social and devil-may-care in your ways. Stern Saturn warns that you might alienate pals or a lover in the process, not to mention losing your focus on your goals. Strike an intelligent balance between play time and work.

"
24 may 2017,aquarius,"Thursday’s new moon falls in your house of romance and having more fun, which should  be something to get excited about. So why are you so grumpy? Could be due to the presence of Pluto, making you more emotional than usual. If you’ve been way too anxious lately about gaining someone’s approval, or demanding guarantees, then you might not be able to enjoy the energy of the upcoming weeks. Put your worries aside, relax and have some fun.

"
25 may 2017,aquarius,"The love train is chugging in to town, thanks to the new moon in the most amorous and frisky part of your chart. You can really enjoy the next six months, provided that you know exactly what you want in love and you’re not afraid to ask for it. Don’t base your ideas about what a happy relationship should look like upon what others are saying or doing. The key is to be true to yourself and to be with someone who respects that.

"
26 may 2017,aquarius,"Some fun activity is brewing in your partnership sector, so get ready. Singles could meet someone new over the weekend, and this won’t be online. Head to parties and barbecues as your best bet for snagging a mate is right in the neighborhood. Couples should plan a spontaneous trip nearby, if possible. Love planet Venus is in your house of “local events” so you won’t have to go to another time zone for romance.

"
27 may 2017,aquarius,"It’s time for you to follow your own inner GPS rather than relying on the advice or opinions of others. The recent new moon should be making you feel like breaking out of a rut or trying a new approach. This shouldn’t be drudgery, either;  doing things for the joy of them is what it’s all about.

"
28 may 2017,aquarius,"Opportunities are going to open up for you in the weeks ahead, and they are the kind that help you develop more security (rather than taking on more risk). With so many planets in your houses of thinking, intuition and creativity you can’t help but succeed. Just stay true to your own vision rather than taking on too much advice from others, no matter how well meaning they may be.

"
29 may 2017,aquarius,"Living for today has its benefits: after all, the mindfulness gurus all talk about focusing on each moment as it passes, not dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. But the cosmos warns that you really do need to get real and start planning ahead more. Flying by the seat of your pants may seem OK right now but it will catch up to you. Consider the consequences of your actions and avoid people and situations that could lead you down the wrong path.

"
30 may 2017,aquarius,"Your ability to network is important today and in the week ahead, so connect with people who are as creative as you are. Together you can come up with some brilliant ideas in both your personal and professional lives. Looking for love, or play dates for your kids, or want to make some new friends? All the more reason to reach out to others.

"
31 may 2017,aquarius,"Getting closer to the people you cherish the most, such as family, gets easier now that chatty Mercury is in a bonding sector. If you need to mend fences or come to grips with old childhood issues (and we all  have them, honey) do so now. The relief that you feel will be palpable.

"
1 june 2017,aquarius,"You’re in an excellent spot to share your ideas with others, so don’t hesitate. This is especially true with group efforts, such as a department meeting at the office, a volunteer effort or your closest confidantes. Exciting new collaborations could be created, and with rational Saturn nearby the success of any endeavor is all but guaranteed.

"
1 june 2016,aquarius,"Love and money don’t always mix, and today you could see evidence of that. A tense angle between the Sun and Neptune could create drama. Perhaps your lover is bent out of shape that you’re earning more than them, or that you’re not making enough! Or your SO wants you to spend cash on items that aren’t necessary: expensive electronics, new kicks for the kids, a pricey vacation to Europe. Work this out while you can, because as the week progresses, things become more incendiary.

"
2 june 2017,aquarius,"There’s a time to hole your cards close to your vest and say as little as possible. Then there are times when it’s in your best interests to open up and let people know what you’re thinking and your plans for the future. The happy Sun and optimistic Jupiter are encouraging you to pursue the latter course. You might be surprised how many people want to travel with you on your journey. As a matter of fact, next week’s full moon is all about networking and joining forces with others.

"
2 june 2016,aquarius,"You may feel moody today Aquarius, but this is not a bad thing. The Moon is stirring up your emotions, specifically your feelings of security, confidence and self-worth. La Luna forms a glorious trine with the North Node, helping you release negative feelings that somehow you “deserve” to be unhappy. Puh-leeze! That’s not the case. Take the toxic trash out to the curb for good.

"
3 june 2017,aquarius,"Can we talk? Hell yeah! Aquarians become quite the motormouths this weekend as charismatic Venus and free-spirited Uranus meet up in your house of witty banter and socializing. You have the cosmos’s permission to go to every cocktail party or barbecue in town. Chat people up, flirt, make some important new connections and meet the neighbors. If your verbosity lends itself to the written word, then start penning that novel or blog.

"
3 june 2016,aquarius,"The Sun and Venus are asking you to take a chance in love, but Saturn is slamming on the brakes. One minute you’re ready to elope, the next minute you’re considering joining a nunnery. Venus fills your head with romantic notions, then Saturn tells you to get real. Even if you’re not this confused (lucky you!) you may find that you’re deep in thought, considering all of the variables of your relationship. Single? You may be questioning whether romance is worth it right now!

"
4 june 2017,aquarius,"Motivation alert! Megawatt Mars is now in your ultra-efficient sixth house of organization and getting things done. It ain’t glamorous, the sixth house, but boy will you feel happier once you’ve completed all of the items on your to-do list. And you will, both at home and at work. This is also the house of fitness and vitality, so the next two months are super for getting back on a diet and exercise regimen. Start eating healthier foods and logging more ZZZZs too……you’ll need the energy!

"
5 june 2017,aquarius,"In 1786 a lovesick Thomas Jefferson penned a twelve page  letter to British artist extraordinaire Maria Cosway, describing the battle going on between his head and his heart as he pined for her. While this may sound juicily romantic, having your head in a twist isn’t always the easiest thing to go through. And right now yours may be in the same place, courtesy of a confusing Sun-Neptune square. Whether you’re mixed up about romance, your career or a family matter, relax. Clarity will arrive at the end of the week.

"
6 june 2017,aquarius,"Your focus will switch to your nearest and dearest thanks to two planets changing signs today: Venus and Mercury. Yes, your career and household chores are calling your name, but they can be pushed to the back burner for awhile. Now that Venus is in your domestic sector, it’s time to spend some quiet time with the people you love…and that includes yourself!

"
7 june 2017,aquarius,"It ain’t easy being sexy and gorgeous, but somebody’s gotta do it, and it might as well be you! Slick little Mercury joins the Sun in your house of fun, flirtation and romance. You can charm the birds from the trees, not only in love but business as well. By the way, hosting Mercury here is superb for heightened creativity and innovation. “Fun” includes hobbies and interests that may have fallen by the wayside. Get back into them.

"
8 june 2017,aquarius,"From your chart it appears that you need to think in a more adventurous way when it comes to your income. No, no, the cosmos isn’t telling you to quit the day job to start the next Microsoft in your basement. But if you feel as though you’re stuck in a financial rut, or you’re worth more than you’re getting paid, it’s time to start doing some research. Tomorrow’s full moon occurs in your house of networking, so reach out to others in your industry or a completely different one. Finding a life coach or a mentor would be a wise move too.

"
9 june 2017,aquarius,"People make the world go ‘round, so they say, and you’d be wise to remember that old adage in the weeks ahead. Tonight’s full moon in your house of camaraderie and networking suggests that you should be mingling with as many people as possible—for finding love, making new business contacts or getting involved in a volunteer project that means a lot to you. With Saturn in a good angle nearby, the connections you make could be in your life for years to come. There’s quite a visionary vibe to this. Be willing to share your ideas and philosophies with others and pay attention to their’s as well.

"
10 june 2017,aquarius,"Business as usual? Hell no! Mighty Jupiter has just gone direct in your freewheeling, risk-taking sector. This is where we grow mentally as we decide to do things differently, maybe even taking a risk. Fortunately wise Saturn is in an auspicious angle, and since this is the planet of logical thinking you should be making decisions that push you beyond previous limits without taking on too much risk.

"
11 june 2017,aquarius,"Get real about your career prospects and financial future, Aquarius. Murky Neptune retrogrades this Friday in your earnings sector for several months. Use this week to wrap up job hunts if you can, and put together a sound budget.

"
12 june 2017,aquarius,"Your ability to find creative solutions that others can’t see will be high today, Aquarius. Better yet is that your personal magnetism will be high, so expect admiring glances from not only your colleagues but potential and existing lovers!

"
13 june 2017,aquarius,"It’s essential that you keep spending in check over the next few months as Neptune is scheduled to go retrograde in your money sector on Friday. Today the watery planet squares off against logical Mercury, which could raise questions about your spending habits when it comes to swag, dinners out and buying things that are nice but not necessary. Also, spending cash on kids (yours or someone else’s) could be in the spotlight. Start being frugal.

"
14 june 2017,aquarius,"Who’s true blue? Figuring out who’s a BFF may be on your mind over the next week. Sometimes the best of friends are the kind of people who stay out of your business and keep their opinions to themselves, unless asked. You may realize that sharing all of the juicy deets of your life isn’t the best way to go.

"
15 june 2017,aquarius,"Not everyone should know your private business, Aquarius, so think twice before you broadcast your latest scoop on Facebook. There is something to be said for maintaining a level of privacy in your life. A Sun-Saturn smackdown today indicates that the juicy tidbits you put out there could come back to haunt you.

"
16 june 2017,aquarius,"Count your pennies—and your hundred dollar bills. Then put them safely away in your bank account, not to be touched for some time. Murky Neptune retrogrades today in your house of income and savings, telling you to be careful about money. Vet new job offers or raises carefully, along with potential clients who appear on the surface to have deep pockets. This may sound austere but it’s better to be safe than sorry.

"
17 june 2017,aquarius,"The planets warn that you need a lot more structure in your life, Aquarius. Whether it’s a morning routine that helps you get out the door easier or a better way of handling the work flow at the office, start making some changes. The new moon on the 24th is all about making progress and decluttering your life. Get a head start this weekend.

"
18 june 2017,aquarius,"Your imagination is on fire this week, so use it to your advantage. There is a creative solution out there for just about any kind of problem you’ve been facing. It’s time to think–and act–out of the box.

"
20 june 2017,aquarius,"Don’t be surprised if someone suggests a spontaneous adventure, something that will take you away from the mundane chores and worries of the day. But you don’t have to wait for the phone to ring—you can also be the one who dreams up some kind of caper and gathers the posse to make it happen.

"
21 june 2017,aquarius,"Like a hot knife through butter! That’s going to be Aquarians over the next four weeks, blasting though their chores, assignments and exercise regimens at warp speeds. An ultra-motivational aspect occurs today—the entry of the Sun and  Mercury into your sixth house of getting things done. A new moon occurs here on the weekend, so get some rest. You’re going to be on a roll.

"
22 june 2017,aquarius,"Put on the rubber gloves and grab the broom. You should be motivated to start decluttering and organizing both your home and office, thanks to hosting three megawatt planets in your house of efficiency. It ain’t sexy doing this kind of work, but will you ever be happy once everything is in order. Feng shui, baby.

"
23 june 2017,aquarius,"When the going gets tough, the tough get going, as they say. It’s time to roll up your shirtsleeves and start taking care of things that are cluttering your physical space and your mind. Unfinished business is just way too stressful. Knock out the grunt work–you’ll be much happier for it.

"
24 june 2017,aquarius,"You need to get handle on the day-to-day “stuff” of life if you want to feel more serene and less stressed. Lighting a fire under you is today’s new moon in your house of organization and productivity. Between now and late December you can make progress when it comes to streamlining your life. And with luxe Venus in a good angle, you should be aiming to beautify your surroundings while you’re at it.

"
25 june 2017,aquarius,"Practicality is the name of the game these days, courtesy of a bevy of planets crowded into your house of efficiency. Lucky for you, inspirational Neptune suggests that the more organized you become the easier it will be for you to earn more. The key, however, is to think big but plan small. Take bite-sized chunks out of your plans, otherwise overwhelm will quickly set in.

"
26 june 2017,aquarius,"Details, details. Sometimes nitpicking is a problem, but this week it’s your best MO. Carefully go over all of the “moving parts” of a project before pushing ahead. Overly optimistic Jupiter may be encouraging you to throw caution to the wind and go for it, but the smart Aquarian slows their roll and takes out the magnifying glass.

"
27 june 2017,aquarius,"Time to create a short list! You may have more things on your to-do list than a human being could possibly accomplish, and that won’t serve you. Having a lot of unfinished tasks hovering over you is a serenity drainer. Pick a few and work on them until they’re complete, then move on.

"
27 june 2016,aquarius,"Momentum starts to build in your career as energetic Mars goes direct in your house of ambition and success! The red planet has been asleep at the wheel for the past few weeks, but this may have helped you crystallize your goals. Now it’s time to put the pedal to the floor. Mercury, planet of negotiation and intelligence, zips into your house of work assignments, bringing in new clients, assignments and potential job offers. Neptune douses you with the inspiration you need to find new sources of income. It’s all good!

"
28 june 2017,aquarius,"You can’t stop a train! And that’s what you’re going to be, Aquarius–a locomotive barreling forward at 90 miles per hour. High energy Mars meets up with faster than lightning Mercury in your house of efficiency, turning you into a powerhouse.

"
28 june 2016,aquarius,"“We have no secrets…we tell each other most everything”, sang Carly Simon years ago. And the planets today are telling you to be open with a partner, be they a lover or business alliance. Let’s face it, there are times when discretion is the greater part of valor, but now is not one of them. The planets sat that it’s wise to let your partner what you’re really all  about.

"
29 june 2017,aquarius,"You would be wise to keep your opinions and bright ideas to yourself today, as it seems that a person around you has a hidden agenda. Your brain should be bubbling over with smart plans and more efficient strategies: don’t let someone else block them, or worse—steal them and then present them as their own.

"
29 june 2016,aquarius,"Sometimes words come flying out of our mouths in a most unexpected manner, and this is not necessarily a positive thing! The same goes for a good rant online, or a strongly worded e-mail. But today’s planetary aspects indicate that letting your thoughts be known is advisable. You may catch some people off guard with your candor, and you might release some deeply held convictions, but so be it.

"
30 june 2017,aquarius,"The eye of the hurricane. That’s where you’ll be today, thanks to a happy Moon-Jupiter connection. Whereas other people around you may be fussing and fighting, steer clear of their petty dramas and go within. Optimistic Jupiter is putting you in a place where you can see the big picture.

"
30 june 2016,aquarius,"Psychologists say that we all have a “shadow side”, and today you may catch a glimpse of one in someone close to you. Truth is it may be a bit unsettling, due to a difficult Venus-Pluto opposition in the heavens. Be wary especially if money or contracts are involved, as well as job interviews, as making an important life decision under these aspects can be dicey. Otherwise, keep your wits about you and your radar on.

"
1 july 2017,aquarius,"Big dreams often cost money, and a practical Moon-Neptune aspect today will help you figure out how to finance your plans. You may need to revise your ideas or trim the fat, something that will become easier to do once the full moon arrives on the 8th.

"
1 july 2016,aquarius,"Healing can occur in so many ways, from the physical, to recovering from grief, to letting go of stress. A magnificent angle today between beneficial Jupiter and magnetic Venus can bring you the healing you need. If you are faced with a physical ailment, ache or pain, sometimes you have to get into the right mindset before the doctor or physical therapist can do their job. Let go and let the curing and repair begin.

"
2 july 2017,aquarius,"Not everyone deserves the inside scoop, Aquarius, so be careful with whom you entrust valuable information. A harsh Mars-Pluto aspect today warns you to keep things on the downlow. With a full moon coming next weekend in the confidentiality sector, this is going to be your MO for the next few weeks.

"
2 july 2016,aquarius,"Planetary influences suggest that it’s time to get your priorities in order, and you may need to get some grunt work out of the way first. Let’s face it, we’d all love to spend time socializing and vacationing, but sometimes you just need to get the oil changed in your car and get your teeth cleaned at the dentist. Take care of the little stuff so that you can enjoy the big stuff.

"
3 july 2017,aquarius,"It may be a holiday weekend in the US but your mind is firmly on big plans for the future. The moon is stirring up your passion to go after your heart’s desire, Neptune is providing inspiration and the Sun is in a practical, “let’s do this” kind of a mood. What are you waiting for?

"
3 july 2016,aquarius,"Routines exist for a reason–they help us streamline our lives so that we can have more free time and less stress. A Sun-Neptune connection today encourages you to examine your habits and routines so that you can sail forward with ease.

"
4 july 2017,aquarius,"Well, ain’t you somethin’. Today sexy Venus enters your house of fun, flirting and romance. Then on Wednesday vivacious Mercury zips into your commitment sector, the place where love and sex gets more serious. And on Saturday a full moon occurs in the house of seclusion….as in,”get a room”. Or seclusion as in “If you don’t want me, I’ll find someone else who will.” What can I say, Aquarius? It’s a win-win for you.

"
4 july 2016,aquarius,"Ready to get your life in order? The new moon in Cancer today falls in your house of efficiency and productivity. The more you streamline, the more new projects you can handle, both at work and at home. Logical Saturn is in an excellent angle from the sector that governs your biggest hopes and dreams, which means that you’re going to be shown a practical way to make things happen.

"
5 july 2017,aquarius,"Sometimes all that’s required to have more goodies fall into your lap is to be more open to receiving things. No, I’m not telling you to read The Secret.  There is a highly practical vibe going on that says if you want more, you need to open your mind to the possibility that it could actually happen. A fabulous Jupiter-Neptune aspect will help you start considering your options.

"
5 july 2016,aquarius,"It’s a great day for money talks, as chatty Mercury forms a trine, the best angle possible, with inspirational Neptune. This isn’t necessarily just about finding a new job, but also about making progress where you are now. 

"
6 july 2017,aquarius,"Your friendliness and generosity are legendary, Aquarius, but sometimes you need to hold back. From your chart it appears that someone may be trying to take advantage of your abundant attitude. You don’t owe them anything, and they also need to learn how to figure things out for themselves.

"
6 july 2016,aquarius,"Your ability to get things done, quickly and effectively, is highlighted with a marvelous Venus-Mars meet up. Monday’s new moon fell in your productivity sector, so the next six months are custom-made for pulling both your personal and business lives in order. Today you can make a terrific impression on the boss, a client, an investor, or anyone in a powerful position. Work those connections, but keep your strategies and discussions under wraps, as tomorrow’s energy is a bit funky.

"
7 july 2017,aquarius,"If a relationship needs some lightening up, then it looks like you’re the one who’s going to have to do it!  With Venus in your fun-loving, frisky fifth house you’re not going to want to be around gloom and doom types. Try to pull them out of their funk and out the door to an interesting concert, movie or cafe. But if they insist on feeling sorry for themselves, then go out and have a good time without them!

"
7 july 2016,aquarius,"Keep your wits about you at the office, as planets in your work sector are acting up. You may get the feeling that things are going on behind the scenes, and it’s possible that there is truth to this. Someone who is acting like a friend could have an agenda of their own. Be observant and reveal little.

"
8 july 2017,aquarius,"If you feel that it’s time to close the door on parts of your life that are simply not worth the trouble any longer, now’s the time to take action. The full moon in your house of healing and moving on will help you assess what (and who) needs to stay or go. A positive Saturn-Uranus aspect suggests that you seek the advice of a mentor or close friend if you’re unsure about some of your decisions.

"
8 july 2016,aquarius,"Time is money, and the more streamlined you become in your daily routine, the more you can earn and save. Over the next six months you’ll be rethinking your regimes, chores and schedules, both at home and at work. Saving money is just one benefit. The other is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your life is in order.

"
9 july 2017,aquarius,"Forgive and forget, or get angry and let it out? That may be the case today as the Moon opposes Mars. If you can wait, Tuesday is a much better time to handle this issue as the Moon will be in your sign.

"
9 july 2016,aquarius,"If it’s been difficult to get your point across in recent days, the planets have your back! A fortuitous meeting between optimistic Jupiter and the thought-provoking Moon will help you spell things out. Mars is helping you from the most authoritative part of your chart, lending gravitas to the discussion.

"
10 july 2017,aquarius,"Just how much sacrificing do you have to do in order to keep other people happy? From your chart it appears that the people around you are expecting a lot. Whether they deserve it to not is another story. If you’re feeling annoyed or resentful, pay attention: it may be time to start letting people handle their own problems.

"
10 july 2016,aquarius,"Sometimes the best thing we can do is to set aside our own personal agenda and cooperate with others, if just for a few days. In doing so, there’s a terrific side benefit–you make a good impression upon people whose opinions count. Planetary influences indicate that you can make a lot of swift progress by letting go of the feeling that you need to protect your own territory.

"
11 july 2017,aquarius,"With the moon in your sign you’ll be more open to taking some chances–and from the looks of your chart, there could be some fun new experiences to be had. You’ve spent enough time lately dealing with other people’s needs (and nonsense)–now it’s your turn to chill out and enjoy life.

"
11 july 2016,aquarius,"A colleague or family member could be a source of drama, as quirky Uranus is sparking them to act out. Whether it’s the silent treatment or a volcanic eruption, you’re not going to be happy. You have a job to do and want to get it done now.  This energy reappears on Saturday, so just do your best to make progress.

"
12 july 2017,aquarius,"Just as we have good personal hygiene habits, such as brushing our teeth or washing our hair, so we need smart mental hygiene habits. And with the Moon in the house of creating helpful routines, you should be thinking about ways to “clean up” your inner landscape.

"
12 july 2016,aquarius,"Are you in the mood for love, Aquarius? Now that Venus is in your house of committed relationships, even the most confirmed bachelors and bachelorettes will be thinking of settling down. Mercury glides into this house tomorrow and the Sun on the 22nd. With this planetary trifecta in place, you don’t stand a chance of remaining single—or unhappy in romance! Start considering your options.

"
13 july 2017,aquarius,"The recent full moon fell in your house of transitions and moving on. And if you’re interested in moving on to a higher pay scale, then take advantage of today’s Moon-Neptune conjunction, an aspect that can help. Money-making ideas could enter your mind, so take note of thoughts or even dreams that may contain some wisdom.

"
13 july 2016,aquarius,"Let’s talk! The planet of meaningful conversations moves into your commitment sector, setting the stage for productive conversation. The next few weeks are superb for discussing issues with your mate, so get everything out on the table. If you’ve been considering entering into some kind of business alliance, reach out. This includes hiring someone one a retainer basis, such as a booking agent, stylist or social media maven.

"
14 july 2017,aquarius,"The recent full moon encouraged you to drop things (and people) that aren’t working for you, which is not always an easy task. But things lighten up considerably with an optimistic Mercury-Jupiter meet up. Finding the right people to take with you on the journey ahead is important, and you’re now in a position to meet some dynamic folks.

"
14 july 2016,aquarius,"No other sign of the zodiac has more ambition than you right now, Aquarius, thanks to Mars barreling through your house of aspirations. But it’s wise to slow down and examine the advantages and disadvantages of your passion projects. With innovative Uranus in your house of perception, you’ll have no shortage of bright ideas. Just vet them first.

"
15 july 2017,aquarius,"Obstacles that appear to be in your way can be overcome more easily than you may have expected. A super Moon-Mars trine will provide you with the insight and motivation to either go around them, under them or mow them over.

"
15 july 2016,aquarius,"Long-term plans get a boost today from a helpful Saturn-Moon meetup in the sky. The Moon will provide you with the passion and excitement to carry them through and Saturn will help you create a sensible, step-by-step system for achieving them. Next week’s full moon is in the most secluded part of your chart, telling you to work behind the scenes–at least for now.

"
16 july 2017,aquarius,"Sitting back and letting others run the show isn’t going to work for you today, especially if they have no freaking clue what they’re doing. Which is why you may need to speak up and voice your opinion–even if they haven’t asked for it!

"
16 july 2016,aquarius,"Wonderful day to have a serious conversation with your amour! Love planet Venus meets up with unreserved Mercury in your commitment sector, opening up hearts and minds.

"
17 july 2017,aquarius,"When it comes to matters of the heart, there are times to be ultra romantic and other times when ya just gotta have the facts–and know where things are heading. Today these two aspects go up against each other. Wait until the Sun enters leo on Thursday before you make any decisions.

"
17 july 2016,aquarius,"As the Moon enters your vibey twelfth house of intuition, meditation, yoga and closure, you may feel like retreating from the world just a bit. The full moon on Tuesday falls in this part of your chart, helping you to create new rituals that are all about self-care and nurturing.

"
18 july 2017,aquarius,"Teamwork and diplomacy are key, especially if you want to enjoy long term success and happiness with an endeavor. This is true in both your personal and business lives. This is no time to fly solo or try to control others. Be willing to share and communicate!

"
18 july 2016,aquarius,"Sometimes we have to take a good long look at ourselves and recognize that we could benefit from some inner work. That’s the message from the cosmos, as transformative Pluto meets up with the Moon in the house of your subconscious mind. What habits, attitudes and thought patterns need to go? What toxic influences might there be in your life, and how can you remove yourself from them? Tomorrow’s full moon in this part of the sky helps you cut out the dead wood.

A fabulous aspect today between romantic Venus and stable Saturn sets your focus on the Real Deal.

Get ready.

"
21 july 2017,aquarius,"Check the fine print today as it appears that there could be an unexpected element lurking in the shadows.

"
23 july 2017,aquarius,"Romantic and business partnerships get a boost from today’s new moon in Leo, and of all the signs of the zodiac you stand the best chance of creating a lasting union.

"
23 july 2016,aquarius,"Now that the Sun is in your house of relationships, your focus will turn to partnering with others.

A good day to talk things over with a partner is next Wednesday.

"
24 july 2017,aquarius,"Too many chefs spoil the sauce, as they say, and receiving input from everyone you know can be exhausting. By all means, seek the advice of others, but be discerning about where they’re coming from. Pull out the nuggets that work best for you.

"
24 july 2016,aquarius,"Speak up! The Moon has just entered your talkative third house of expression. If you have considered entering into a business alliance, now is an excellent time to do so.

"
25 july 2017,aquarius,"Your ability to read between the lines is going to increase dramatically over the next three weeks thanks to probing, intelligent Mercury in your eighth house. This will be especially true in close personal relationships. Figuring yourself out ought to be a lot easier too!

"
25 july 2016,aquarius,"Which can you trust–your emotions or logic? Both will be operating at full tilt, with your intuition throwing in a few statements here and there. The bottom line: don’t make any major decisions today. Consider all of your thoughts, feelings and ideas as valuable input…which you’ll use to figure things out later in the week.

"
26 july 2017,aquarius,"Romance can heat up faster than a house on fire, thanks to a synergistic meeting of the Sun and Mars.

26 july 2016,aquarius,"How you handle family matters is the question of the day, Aquarius! Pluto, the great change maker, asks you to take a more intuitive approach in dealing with parents, siblings, kids or roommates. The recent full moon was all about setting boundaries, but sometimes you need to take the back door approach rather than the front door.

"
27 july 2017,aquarius,"You know what you want and you intend to get it! The only issue is that you need the help of others to make things happen. Don’t leave their needs and opinions out of the picture.Cooperate and make faster progress as a result.

"
27 july 2016,aquarius,"The astrological picture suggests that the next few days are excellent for communicating your ideas to others, especially romantic partners or business alliances. If plans need to be made about which direction your partnership is heading in, it’s wise to firm them up before Friday when Uranus goes retrograde. You’ll be able to make progress after then, but there could be disagreements about details.

"
28 july 2017,aquarius,"Your optimism should be rising thanks to a happy Moon-Jupiter meet-up—so why are you feeling reluctant or unsure? Maybe you’re convinced that God/The Universe doesn’t have any goodies in store for you, or that your karma sucks. Nothing could be further from the truth; it’s just your own fears. Chin up!

"
28 july 2016,aquarius,"No doubt you’re feeling quite industrious these days, as get-things-done Mars is ratcheting up your ambition. But the Moon in Taurus opposes Mars today, suggesting that you slow down a bit and take stock. You can’t be on the go all the time. Nesting at home with your family, pets, garden and hobbies is a good way to recharge those batteries of yours, which I’d like to point out are a little drained!

"
29 july 2017,aquarius,"Blurt alert! You could accidentally spill today, and your words could land you in a difficult spot. Avoid the temptation too to let someone have it, even if they have it coming. They might retaliate in a subtle yet powerful way.

"
29 july 2016,aquarius,"Slow down! Uranus has just gone retro in your house of socializing and zipping around the neighborhood. Uranus loves technology, so maybe you’ve gotten used to texting instead of face to face talking, or ordering your groceries online rather than shopping at the store. Instead, why don’t you head to the farmer’s market on weekends and eyeball the delicious produce and homemade breads and jams. Call a pal and spend the afternoon just catching up. Give the electronics a rest and go Luddite. You might be pleasantly surprised–and less stressed.

"
30 july 2017,aquarius,"Today’s a day when you might even surprise yourself, as spontaneous Uranus encourages you to say or do something out of character. But this is a good thing. You’ve gotten stuck in a rut and need to bust out of it. Creativity soars thanks to Venus, so let a new freaky flag fly.

"
30 july 2016,aquarius,"With so much planetary energy in your house of commitment, no doubt your mind is on matters of the heart, whether you’re attached or single. Fortunately for you, perceptive Mercury glides into your eighth house of deep emotions and intimacy today, allowing you to get in touch with your most private thoughts and concerns. Better yet is that you’ll be able to share them with the people closest to you. Don’t hold back.

"
31 july 2017,aquarius,"Rising above silly distractions and petty people becomes easier now that Venus is in your house of getting things done. You’ll never get around to finishing anything if you can’t get focused. Over the next three weeks you’ll be surprised at how much you can accomplish.

"
31 july 2016,aquarius,"Take a time out, Aquarius. The cosmos is telling you that both your body and mind need some TLC. Rest, rejuvenate, pamper yourself. With so much planetary activity in your office and efficiency sector, you’ve been busy with errands, household chores and your work flow. Chill.

"
1 august 2017,aquarius,"You’re going to have to play the role of the consummate diplomat today, whether you’re dealing with clients, co-workers or people in your personal world. A lot can be accomplished but everyone needs to get on the same page first–and you’re looking like the one who may have to pull everyone together.

"
1 august 2016,aquarius,"Partnering up with others is on the planets’ agenda for you these days, and two terrific trines can make it happen. A surprise offer could come your way from someone who’d like to enter into a business alliance, or ask you to join a team of like-minded people. On the romance front singles could find that a pal is instrumental in introducing them to a new love, and this is a serious contender, not a wannabe.

"
2 august 2017,aquarius,"Who loves ya, baby? Consider the people around you who are of the “tried and true” variety rather than the on-again, off-again flakes. If a certain connection isn’t solid you may decide at the time of next week’s eclipse to cut the cord and move on.

"
2 august 2016,aquarius,"Time to board the soul train! A sweet new moon in your commitment sector could bring about a soulful connection with another over the next six months. Existing romances could become deeper, and all Aquarians can see forward movement in their big plans. Mars enters your house of closely held dreams and wishes today just as the new moon occurs. Nice timing.

"
3 august 2017,aquarius,"Next week’s lovely lunar eclipse is in your sign, setting the stage for you to make some major changes over the next six months. From your chart it appears that learning more is the ticket to success, whether you’re looking for a promotion at work, to lose twenty pounds or to become more organized. Uranus is retrograding today in your house of thinking and planning, a wonderful aspect for gaining better skills.

"
3 august 2016,aquarius,"Your ability to communicate your ideas with flair and eloquence is high, Aquarius. Use it to your advantage, whether you’re chatting with friends or making a presentation to a group. Over the next six months your life can improve enormously by meeting new people, so join groups, attend seminars and networking events, or volunteer for a good cause. This week is awesome for lining up a new partnership of a serious nature, be it romantic or business related.

"
4 august 2017,aquarius,"Is your gut telling you that you’re overlooking something important? It could be with subterranean Pluto in the intuition sector squaring Jupiter. You may be so optimistic about a certain project or person that you may not be focusing on key details. Slow down and take an assessment.

"
4 august 2016,aquarius,"As the passionate Moon swings past Venus and Mercury in the house of intimacy, you will be reflecting upon the state of your union. Is your current relationship providing you with the freedom to be who you really are, and to go after some of things you’re most passionate about? Singles need to consider this as well before they enter into a new relationship. A romantic alliance shouldn’t feel like a confined space.

"
5 august 2017,aquarius,"Some relationships have too many “rules”; others could use a few more. Take an assessment of your close alliances to determine if any of them need to be altered. Truth be told, with Monday’s lunar eclipse coming in your sign, you’re not in the mood for anyone overstepping their bounds.

"
5 august 2016,aquarius,"Venus, planet of ease and comfort, glides into your house of intimacy today, encouraging you to share your thoughts with the people closest to you. But a strained aspect with Mars suggests that you choose you confidantes wisely. Just because someone is a friend or lover doesn’t mean that they get a free access pass to your mind.

"
6 august 2017,aquarius,"You may feel pulled between playing it safe and living on the edge, and the problem is that your intuition won’t be any help! No problem, however. All of this is due to tomorrow’s impending eclipse in your sign, stirring up your desire for change. There’s no need to make any major decisions today.

"
6 august 2016,aquarius,"With Saturn getting ready to resume direct motion on the 13th in the house of your fondest wishes, your mind should be focused on the future. But who is going to travel forward with you on this journey? That’s the big question this weekend as a bevy of planets are stirring the pot. Are certain people going to be left behind as new ones come on board? Give it some thought, but don’t make decisions just yet. Wait for Saturn to start moving forward.

"
7 august 2017,aquarius,"Well ain’t you special. A rocking lunar eclipse in Aquarius puts you front and center: your needs, desires, dreams, image and esteem. As full moons bring things to a close, this happy eclipse closes out a chapter in your life that may have been unfulfilling. Between now and your birthday season you can replace the worn-out parts with some sweet and successful alternatives.

"
7 august 2016,aquarius,"Some long term plans may need readjusting, as the Moon in Libra finds you questioning their affordability. You may also be ruminating over the practical considerations that need to be dealt with. Planetary influences indicate that your emotions may be getting stirred up also, so give your deepest feelings their due. This Wednesday is perfect for getting to the bottom of the matter.

"
8 august 2017,aquarius,"The effects of yesterday’s lunar eclipse in your sign will be felt for months, and things could actually get rolling today. Brilliant Uranus, planet of innovation, is active in your thinking and strategizing sector, pushing you to come up with new ideas now  about what you’d like to manifest in the year ahead. Why wait?

"
8 august 2016,aquarius,"Some readjustments are in order when it comes to pursuing your goals, especially when it comes to financing them. With luxury-loving Venus now in your house of debt and financial obligations, you may be tempted to spend money on swag (not to mention sports cars, boats, dream houses), but the planets warn to save some cash for a rainy day. When saturn goes direct this Saturday you’ll be able to develop a logical and secure plan.

"
9 august 2017,aquarius,"If something has been niggling away at you about a close relationship, it’s time to do some digging. You need to know where you stand and what others are thinking. If that means doing a little snooping so be it.

"
9 august 2016,aquarius,"The planets are casting their gaze on your security, be it romantic or financial, and naturally this can bring up strong emotions. Recent activity in the cosmos may have made you unsure as to the best direction to head in, but that begins to change today. The Moon in Scorpio is bringing out your decisive side, and it forms a helpful angle with Venus. The message? Change doesn’t need to be painful or dramatic!

"
10 august 2017,aquarius,"A Mercury-Venus aspect is perfect for talking about emotional issues in a level-headed, practical way. The cosmos is telling you to develop more structure and stability in your closest relationships. Today is a smart time to do so without drama or unrealistic thinking.

"
10 august 2016,aquarius,"Soul connection. A superb Mercury-Pluto trine enables you to get in touch with your deepest thoughts and feelings. Whether they’re traumatic or joyful, the bottom line is that you can experience a lovely change in the days ahead. Pluto’s goal is to help you reframe the way you view life, because this dwarf planet knows that your thoughts create your reality.

"
11 august 2017,aquarius,"The recent lunar eclipse in Aquarius is putting your needs front and center, but this doesn’t mean that you’ll be going it all by yourself. As a matter of fact, a helpful Sun-Jupiter aspect suggests that you team up with others in order to make progress. Two heads are better than one.

"
11 august 2016,aquarius,"The energy of a group dynamic is the focus of the planets today, as Mars and Saturn in the friendship and teamwork sector stir the pot. Just how much should you say or reveal? No matter how much you might trust your tribe it would be wise to censor what you put out there, verbally or via social media and texts. While it doesn’t seem that there’s a frenemy lurking about, the danger is that your feelings may get hurt if you feel that your point of view isn’t being considered.

"
12 august 2017,aquarius,"Lock up the credit cards, Aquarius! Mercury retrogrades in your debt sector til the 31st, making the next few weeks a bad time to splurge. Be super vigilant when it comes to financial documents, such as mortgage papers. Avoid shopping online and protect your passwords. Keep your confidential information safe.

"
12 august 2016,aquarius,"The planets are shining their focus on the people in your circle, Aquarius, and you might be entering into quite an active, social time. But “keeping up with the Joneses” is a possibility under today’s influences, as you hear about your friends’ raises, vacations and wedding plans. Your dreams may have seemed out of reach over the past few months, but that’s about to change. Quit comparing your life to other people in your circle–instead, pay attention to your  path ahead.

"
13 august 2017,aquarius,"Collaborations with others can really heat up over the next six months, and your best experiences will be with others by your side. The next 48 hours could bring some new people your way, or suggestions for alliances that are certainly interesting. These  have some serious long term potential, by the way, so get ready to commit.

"
13 august 2016,aquarius,"Everyone knows that you’re the ultimate team player of the zodiac, but over the past five months you may have discovered that others have had their own agendas take precedence over those of the partnership or group. Well, that’s about to change, aquarius, as mighty Saturn moves direct in your eleventh house of teamwork. This house also governs technology, so if you’ve been stuck in techno hell trying to iron out apps, programs or a website launch, expect the computer gremlins to go bye-bye.

"
14 august 2017,aquarius,"Time for some feng shui? Even if you don’t believe in that concept, the cosmos is telling you to declutter your space, both at work and at home. A cluttered desk leads to a cluttered mind. Who needs the stress?

"
14 august 2016,aquarius,"Looking for ironclad guarantees in a relationship? They may be hard to come by over the next few days. Venus and Neptune are at odds with each other, creating a dilemma in which your need for security is pitted against the desire for more than that. Wednesday’s venus-Pluto trine will help you get to the bottom of the matter.

"
15 august 2017,aquarius,"You can’t believe everything you hear, so be wary of taking someone at their word. From your chart it appears that someone has a hidden agenda, and that you may be too quick to buy into it. Vet everything you hear and avoid making key decisions this week.

"
16 august 2017,aquarius,"You may be in a playful mood, wanting to take a quick vacation with your lover or splurge on the kids, but the planets warn against overspending. Stick to your budget and come up with activities that don’t cost a lot. Once the Sun enters Virgo next week you’ll be able to boost your savings.

"
16 august 2016,aquarius,"Innovative Uranus is your best friend today, sparking your mind with creative (maybe even genius!) ideas. If so, don’t keep them to yourself. A positive Sun-Uranus trine encourages you to share your brainstorms with people who can help you turn them into something real. There’s a strong profit potential involved with this; make sure that although you’re willing to collaborate, that your interests are protected.

"
17 august 2017,aquarius,"Nitpicking won’t get you far today; as a matter of fact, it may piss people off. It can also create paralysis by analysis with a project or goal of yours. Sometimes you just have to let go and trust that things will work out…which they will.

"
17 august 2016,aquarius,"Ready to move ahead? Tomorrow’s full moon in Aquarius will set the stage for the next six months, so consider what you’d like to achieve between now and your birthday. Today you benefit from an auspicious meeting: Venus and Pluto are discussing what to toss and what to keep. Pluto may require that you start over completely in areas of your life that are over, done; and Venus’ goal is to make the changes ahead come easily for you.

"
18 august 2017,aquarius,"Getting organized becomes a heck of a lot easier when take-it-easy Venus is on your side. The weekend is here, so start digging in to some tasks that you’ve been meaning to get to. Break them into bite-sized chunks so that you don’t become overwhelmed, a real possibility under the current cosmic picture.

"
18 august 2016,aquarius,"“Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you….”  What? It’s August! But that doesn’t mean that the cosmos isn’t delivering goodies your way. Today it does, with a full moon in Aquarius. You may be wrapping up initiatives that started back around the time of your birthday, and now you’re ready for some new ones. Matters of the heart are especially focused on with a Sun-Uranus trine. It’s an excellent time to have a conversation with a lover about where you’re heading.

"
19 august 2016,aquarius,"With Mars in your house of big plans in a tense angle to confusing Neptune in the income sector over the next week, it may be hard to get to grips with a budget or business plan. The key is to slow down and carefully consider your options. In the days ahead you’ll be able to come up with rational, concrete goals that you can afford.

"
20 august 2016,aquarius,"The recent full moon in your sign is helping you make key decisions, Aquarius. Over the next few weeks and months you’ll be culling out what’s important and what needs to go. A Moon-Venus opposition today will shine its light on your closest relationships and just how secure you feel in them. While you’re being encouraged to speak your mind and let others know exactly how you feel, someone may not be as open or willing to talk right now. Don’t push it. The atmosphere improves next week.

"
21 august 2016,aquarius,"Teaming up with others is a big theme in the days and weeks ahead, and today the Moon is in a good position to help you find the right connections. Someone that you may not have expected to be a good fit could actually be just the right person, so keep an open mind.

"
22 august 2016,aquarius,"Money talks, and it certainly will be talking to you over the next few weeks. Today the Sun rolls into your eighth house of finances, joining profitable Jupiter, intelligent Mercury and charismatic Venus. This is one heck of a lineup for analyzing your portfolio and figuring out how to increase your net worth. There may be opportunities coming your way to team up with someone else–for work, a business partnership, or as an investor. Entertain offers but do your homework before you invest your precious time and money.

"
23 august 2016,aquarius,"Joining forces with other people is the name of the game right now, Aquarius, and your friends could be the key to some exciting opportunities in the future. The chance to be part of a team in your industry is also on the table and networking could pay off handsomely in the weeks ahead. One caveat: be careful of investing your hard-earned money in a venture that may come your way, whether it’s a pal’s destination wedding or a relative’s new restaurant. You need to protect your financial portfolio and build it through things that are rock solid.

"
24 august 2016,aquarius,"Be meticulous when choosing the people in your circle, Aquarius. A stern meeting today between Saturn and Mars is designed to help you pick and choose the players you want by your side, from friends to lovers to work colleagues. Your long term plans stand an excellent chance of succeeding, as Saturn is lending its wisdom and Mars its drive. But the wrong partners will not only slow your progress, they can derail it.

"
25 august 2016,aquarius,"Whoever coined the term “FOMO” was on to something. Fear of missing out is an ugly little demon made worse by incessantly tuning in to social media and watching “everyone else” have fun. Watch that this little bugger doesn’t bite you on the butt today, quite possible under current planetary influences. Comparing yourself to others–and spending money you may not have to keep up with them–is only going to making you more unhappy. With an awesome solar eclipse next week in your financial zone, you’ll be looking at more love and cash flow over the next six months.

"
26 august 2016,aquarius,"You may feel a bit like a fish out of water today, due to a Mars-Neptune square that could undermine your sense of self-worth. This may be especially true among friends or people you see on a regular basis, such as team members or people who are in the same volunteer or charity group as you. But it seems that your fears are unfounded, so go easy on yourself. There’s no need to be defensive.

"
27 august 2016,aquarius,"An emotional bonding today between two of the most benevolent planets in our solar system will work wonders for soothing your soul. They meet in your house of spiritual clearing, sexual chemistry and deep emotions. It’s quite a healing vibe, so take the time to be good to yourself.

"
28 august 2016,aquarius,"Lunar activity indicates that you might hit upon a bright idea for earning more, and it seems to come from having to struggle in the past. The old saying about learning from your mistakes is so true today. But with the Moon in a tough angle to blabbermouth Uranus, keep any brainstorms you may have to yourself for now. They could be quite profitable and you need to own that information.

"
29 august 2016,aquarius,"Hold your horses there, pardner. You may be anxious to get ambitious plans off the ground–going back to school, starting a business, traveling to an exotic locale–but Mercury retrogrades in your finance sector tomorrow. Don’t make any major decisions or embark on a new venture without having the monetary details completely vetted, especially if you’re taking out loans or relying on an investor.

"
30 august 2016,aquarius,"The planets are pushing you forward onto a larger stage with a bigger spotlight thanks to Venus entering the most adventurous part of your chart. You could be getting ready to apply to grad school, get engaged, travel around the world or patent an invention. But Mercury retrogrades in your house of finances, indicating that you need to make sure that the money is there before you move forward. A lover may also be on the defensive as you discuss your plans–are they afraid that you’ll fly away?

"
31 august 2016,aquarius,"An independent streak is going to start blazing a path in your mind, and I pity the person who tries to hold you back. It’s not that you’re going to be selfish or thoughtless, but Venus is pushing you to take better care of yourself. And if that means setting boundaries or even cutting ties, so be it.

"
1 september 2016,aquarius,"You’ve got mail! News could be coming your way soon about a joint venture that someone would like to enter into with you, and this could be romantic as well as business-related. Today’s solar eclipse in Virgo can boost your finances as opportunities open up for investing and earning passive income. And your love life could take a sexy, more intimate turn for the better as you become more confident about being vulnerable and strong at the same time.

"
2 september 2016,aquarius,"Emotional much? The good news is that a happy meeting between Jupiter and Mercury will help you make progress when it comes to relating to a loved one or healing outworn, negative feelings. But Neptune may start whispering in your ear, “Don’t rock the boat! There’s nothing wrong with the crummy old past!” Uh, yes….there is. And it’s time to take it to the curb.

"
3 september 2016,aquarius,"Ooh la la! The passionate Moon winks at generous Jupiter in your house of libido, then swings past love planet Venus in the place where we become (ahem) adventurous. 2 + 2=4. This one isn’t hard to figure out. Singles, you’re not left out of this conversation. You could spend some time this weekend with Mr. or Ms. Right Now, or wait for Mr./Ms. Right to show up around the time of the lunar eclipse on the 16th.

"
4 september 2016,aquarius,"Open mouth, insert foot? You may want to keep your opinions to yourself today as the Moon may prompt you to blurt something out that you’ll regret saying. While your opinions and emotions are probably right on target, thanks to the Sun’s position, you could create a destabilizing situation for yourself by venting. Sometimes you just have to be more concerned about your security than rocking the boat, and this is one of these days.

"
5 september 2016,aquarius,"Powerful planetary forces are at work trying to help you earn and save more money, but you seem to be dealing with some negative emotions that are getting in your way. Memories of past financial problems may be bubbling to the surface, or the feeling that you tried something before and it didn’t work. Or perhaps you lack the self-confidence to visualize a more prosperous future. That’s going to change on Friday, when Jupiter’s move into Libra starts filling you with more optimism.

"
6 september 2016,aquarius,"The iron fist in the velvet glove. That describes you today, Aquarius, as the cosmos tells you to take command of a situation–without making a big stink about it! On the contrary, you should seize the reins with a smile on your face and honey dripping from every word. No one’s telling you to lie or be deceitful. It’s just that sometimes true power needs to be cloaked.

"
7 september 2016,aquarius,"Get out the dream catchers, some incense and those beautiful crystals. A powerfully healing aspect between two major orbs, the Sun and Pluto, will help you put things in the right perspective. Catharsis can happen while you’re in the shower or standing on line at the bank, but you can speed things along by creating a little altar at home with objects that help center you. Daily devotion to your inner peace is time well spent.

"
8 september 2016,aquarius,"Your mind will stop focusing on mundane things like getting the grocery shopping done and instead dwell on loftier aims: travel, going back to school, immersing yourself in other cultures and maybe even taking up philosophy. If you’ve never read the book 1000 Places to See before You Die, now’s a good time. No, you’re not dying. But the moon forms a superb angle with Mars and Saturn today, making you realize that there’s more to life than the little world you’ve gotten used to.

"
9 september 2016,aquarius,"Feeling entrepreneurial? Got wanderlust so bad that you’re ready to pack a bag and head to the airport—now?! Ready to take on a course load at a college or skill development academy? Thank generous Jupiter for the sudden surge in ambition and the desire to expand your mind. Today the big planet heads into Libra, where it will stir you over the next year to live a much bigger, more adventurous life.

"
10 september 2016,aquarius,"A tough Saturn-Neptune square urges caution when it comes to money matters, especially when it comes to financing big plans of yours. For example, don’t plan the wedding of the century, operating on the premise that you’ll receive enough money in the form as gifts to cover the cost of the affair. And don’t let friends (or your envy of them) seduce you into spending money just to keep up with their lifestyle. With murky Neptune in your income and security sector, you have to be pragmatic about finances.

"
11 september 2016,aquarius,"Sometimes you just gotta tell it like it is, but beware of being too blunt. Venus in Libra may make you quite opinionated, and while there’s nothing wrong with “speaking your truth” as the saying goes, today’s tense angle with Pluto means that you could be up against some opposition. The problem is that the other person may mask their displeasure. Think before you speak.

"
12 september 2016,aquarius,"Your brain will be buzzing with ideas about how to build a more solid financial foundation, Aquarius! With smart-as-a-whip Mercury linking to the illuminating Sun, you can make progress in paying down debt, going after monies owed to you or lining up some kind of passive income on the side. But remain patient. Mars is burning a path through your house of big dreams and wishes, possibly making you impatient to see more dinero. One step at a time.

"
13 september 2016,aquarius,"With Mercury retrograde in your eighth house of finances, this is an excellent time to get a handle on your portfolio. Figure out ways to pay down debt, start putting away more money for retirement and consider starting a business that will pull in more cash, even if it’s a side gig for now. With Friday’s lunar eclipse in your income sector a “little business” could morph into something much bigger.

"
14 september 2016,aquarius,"Your sign is known for its love of life and the desire to socialize, so today’s celestial aspects are going to be right down your alley. A happy Moon-Uranus-Mars connection is perfect for doing something spontaneous with your tribe. Take advantage of it now, because once the lunar eclipse occurs later this week, your thoughts will turn to more practical matters—like making mo’ money.

"
15 september 2016,aquarius,"You’re entering a major crossroad at which you’ll need to make decisions about money, your occupation, and even your self-worth. Tomorrow’s eclipse in Pisces will bring long-simmering issues and concerns to a boil. But don’t make any major decisions today, as foggy Neptune is meeting up with the  emotional Moon. You run the risk of operating on feelings and not facts.

"
16 september 2016,aquarius,"Your self-esteem is about to get big boost, along with your income! A powerful and productive lunar eclipse today will put an end to past dry spells when it comes to money. As eclipses work quickly, you could suddenly come up with an income-building strategy that will take off. Likewise, a new job offer could come your way in the months ahead. And as you earn more, save more.

"
17 september 2016,aquarius,"Keep your schedule light today, as independent Uranus could spark an impromptu party, brunch, dinner out or a trip to the beach. Don’t be surprised if a pal calls you at the last minute to plan an adventure. You only live once—make sure that you fill your days with some fun here and there!

"
18 september 2016,aquarius,"If there’s one sign of the zodiac that should be feeling like taking a risk and living a more adventurous life, it’s you, Aquarius! And today spontaneous Uranus could spur you into looking into new avenues, whatever that might mean to you. It may hit you all at once that you’re living just a little bit too safe. Get out of that box!

"
19 september 2016,aquarius,"You’re in a good spot in which your knowledge, intuition, and wise input from others can all come together. Run your ideas past a mentor, friend or expert today as a helpful angle between Venus and Mars could ring you the answers or solution that you’re seeking.

"
20 september 2016,aquarius,"If you feel as though you’re going through therapy (even if you’re not meeting with a counselor!) you can thank mental Mercury and cathartic Pluto for your intense thoughts and emotions. The good news is that they form a glorious trine today, enabling you to start tossing out old thoughts and feelings that need to be excised from your psyche. Once Thursday arrives you can move forward with more confidence and ease.

"
22 september 2016,aquarius,"If there’s going to be one sign of the zodiac that is itching to pack a bag and get out of town it’s you, Aquarius! The Sun enters Libra today, your inspirational ninth house of travel and adventure. Considering that it’s joining optimistic Jupiter, you won’t let anything hold you back. And that includes all areas of your life, like love, education, and your career.

"
23 september 2016,aquarius,"With lucky, optimistic Jupiter and the Sun now in the most adventurous part of your chart you should be brimming with big ideas and plans. A small voice, however, may be whispering in your ear, questioning whether you can pull them off. The key is to pay attention to the details. Take care of the small stuff and the big stuff will happen.

1 october 2016,aquarius,"A luscious new moon in your adventurous ninth house occurs, encouraging you to start coloring outside the lines! Problem is, Mars and Pluto in the moody, mysterious twelfth house of the subconscious mind may make you a bit reluctant to put yourself out there and take a risk. Since Pluto governs our “shadow side” you may want to reflect upon the ways that your fears have held you back in the past. That being said, a super Venus-Neptune trine the same day is perfect for going after a higher salary and/or a new gig.

"
11 october 2016,aquarius,"It’a a corny old saying, but here goes: “Minds are like parachutes. They function best when they’re open.” Truer words were never spoken for you, Aquarius, as a megawatt conjunction between perceptive Mercury and blessed Jupiter helps blow the cobwebs out of your brain.

"
15 october 2016,aquarius,"Keep a close eye on your thoughts and words as four planets are snarling at each other in the sectors that govern your mind and how you communicate.

"
16 october 2016,aquarius,"Got something to say? Then today’s full moon in your communication sector may push you to get the word out. Wrap up anything you’ve been working on, such as a thesis, contract, Powerpoint demonstration, piece of art, a music video or CD, anything that acts as a form of self-expression. But keep it positive, as maverick Uranus is in a tight position to the Moon. Don’t troll, rant or vent. And make sure that the projects you’re working on are polished so they shine.

If you head off every day to a soul sucking job that doesn’t fulfill you, or work with difficult people, you might feel more annoyed than usual. That’s OK though— the Sun’s entry into your success and ambition sector on Saturday bodes well for making positive changes.

"
22 october 2016,aquarius,"You won’t need Tony Robbins to motivate you, Aquarius! The Sun will do the job, thank you very much, now that it’s in Scorpio, your tenth house of ambition and success.

Create goals, plan strategies, brainstorm, and reach out to mentors or decision makers who can help you progress. A terrific new moon here on the 30th is the perfect time to kick off fresh initiatives.

"
23 october 2016,aquarius,"With the holidays coming you may have some serious spending on your mind, but the planets are warning you to keep a lid on expenses. A helpful Jupiter-Neptune angle today suggests that you sit down and create a solid budget, rather than flying by the seat of your pants when it comes to money. With Jupiter in your house of big plans and deceptive Neptune in the savings sector, you may be far too optimistic about cash flow.

"
24 october 2016,aquarius,"Your mind will be more focused than a laser beam, Aquarius, now that quick witted Mercury has just joined the fiery Sun in your house of ambition. While the Sun helps point you in the right direction, it’s little Mercury that pushes you to draw up plans, prioritize, reach out to others who can help you and express your ideas. Thursday is a super day for progress.

"
25 october 2016,aquarius,"Usually our friends provide us with winning advice as they know us better than anyone—and they want the best for us. But a tense Venus-Neptune angle today indicates that a pal or colleague could make a remark that will leave you feeling unsettled. You could also feel that a romantic relationship is off somehow. Let this pass, as tomorrow brings an upbeat vibe that will make this a distant memory.

"
26 october 2016,aquarius,"Friends and colleagues could suggest some kind of venture, and you may want to consider it.

These two orbs are holding a power lunch in your career and ambition house, so this is serious stuff! This is  not a day to be shy.

"
28 october 2016,aquarius,"Finish what you’ve already started before leaping into new activities. A zesty Moon-Jupiter aspect may get you fired up to take on new challenges, but trying to move forward before you have closed the door on other ones could create havoc. For your own peace of mind, slow down and do things the right way.

"
29 october 2016,aquarius,"Just because a thought pops into your head doesn’t mean that you should express it out loud! As a matter of fact you’d be better off holding your tongue as erratic Uranus could prompt you to blurt out something that you shouldn’t. This is especially true when it comes to a matter involving a friend or a group that you’re involved with. Likewise, if you’re taking action toward some cherished goals, keep the details to yourself for the time being.

"
30 october 2016,aquarius,"Yeah, baby! Gotta love today’s new moon in your career sector. Every year each sign of the zodiac receives a new moon in this part of their chart, but this one is more helpful than those of years past, Aquarius.

Better yet is that intelligent Mercury, also in this ambitious house, forms a harmonious trine with Neptune in your earnings sector. Want to see more green? Then show people your innovative side.

"
31 october 2016,aquarius,"Brand new opportunities are coming your way, things that can fulfill some lofty ambitions. The recent new moon will open doors. The question is–should you walk through all of them? Take your time as impatient Mars in your house of closure could make you way too anxious to move on to greener pastures. And erratic Uranus could find you babbling about situations that should be kept confidential for now. Say little and observe a lot.
 

"
1 november 2016,aquarius,"With so much recent planetary activity in your career house no one could blame you for being confused about which direction to head in. The fog should begin to clear today thanks to the Sun’s influence. It appears that you need to get real about spending and budgeting for starters. Don’t kid yourself that you can stretch a dollar further. If you need to have more money coming in, you need to take action to make it happen.

"
2 november 2016,aquarius,"You may have been teetering back and forth as to what to do regarding a career matter, but things are looking up. A recent Sun-Neptune trine is opening your eyes to a number of possibilities that you will be able to pursue in the weeks and months ahead. Neptune is retrograde, so if your concern is “show me the money”, you may need to wait for it to resume direct motion before you see more dinero. Fortunately the watery planet resumes forward motion on the 19th.

"
3 november 2016,aquarius,"Superman, Zorro, the Green Hornet, Batman—all of these are archetypes of the strong silent type, the hero who doesn’t want or need recognition. As the Wizard of Oz said, “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.” And that’s the kind of vibe you have going on today, as powerful Pluto, in the most hidden part of your chart, meets up with the authoritative Sun. You’re stepping into your own power without a lot of fanfare, but who cares? Sometimes it’s more advantageous to be working quietly behind the scenes.

But clinging to comfort and security may be holding you back. The full moon on the 14th will help you realize that.

"
6 november 2016,aquarius,"If you have a goal or dream that you’d like to see happen, today and the early part of the week are perfect for talking about it with others. Seek out a mentor or someone who has already accomplished what you would like to manifest. Ask a trusted friend or family member for their advice. Attend a seminar that applies to your dream, or pick up a book on the topic. Uranus encourages you to open your mind and let new information flow in.

"
7 november 2016,aquarius,"Got talent? Then don’t hide your light under a bushel. But it is perfectly OK to dazzle someone behind closed doors, like going on a job interview or holding a confidential meeting. People in positions of power may be holding back, but don’t let this frustrate you. Things will gain momentum by the end of the week.

"
8 november 2016,aquarius,"Watch out world! Mars is just about ready to enter the sign of Aquarius on Wednesday, its first visit here in two years.

Use the red planet’s abundance of energy to kickstart new projects and ambition that you’ve had in mind for some time now, whether it’s a fitness plan, a business launch or looking for a new house. While you’re at it, wrap up unfinished projects once Venus goes into Capricorn on Friday. The process should go smoother than you think and the peace of mind you gain will be terrific.

"
10 november 2016,aquarius,"Can’t see the forest for the trees? You may have been so fixated as of late with going after some big projects or ambitions that you may have neglected some of the smaller stuff. You know–habits, routines, protocols, the fine details that actually add up to something big. Start focusing on how to just get through this day and week before you worry about achieving world domination.

"
11 november 2016,aquarius,"Now that ambitious Mars is gracing your sign, it’s time to overcome inertia and get moving on pet projects. But keep your thoughts and plans to the confines of your trusted inner circle, as Venus just glided into your confidentiality sector. Her presence in this part of your chart could also make creative juices flow like wine, so get ready to get inspired.

"
12 november 2016,aquarius,"Now that Mars is finally visiting your sign for the first time since 2014, you can start focusing on some big changes you’d like to make.

"
13 november 2016,aquarius,"Talks can heat up in the weeks ahead when it comes to joining forces with other people who share a common goal.

"
14 november 2016,aquarius,"Major changes are afoot in a domestic or family situation as a full moon occurs in this part of your chart. Something may be reaching an end point, such as your willingness to deal with nosy parents, roommate or a kid’s attitude. Perhaps you’ve grown tired of the house you’re living in, or the neighborhood. The good news is that this lunation closes out an old chapter and opens up a better one, so get ready for positive changes.

And with assertive Mars in your sign, you could end up in the spotlight. But make sure that everyone knows their roles and that the budget for this project is well researched. Otherwise this could go off the rails in the near future. When the Sun enters Sagittarius on the 21st, clarity returns.

You’re not lacking in ambition, not with the Sun in the success part of your chart. But you do need to tweak your methods to make sure that you’re working smart, not hard.

"
18 november 2016,aquarius,"You’re sign is friendly by nature, and with the Sun about to enter your house of camaraderie you should enjoy a social month ahead. But the planets warn that you need to vet the people around you, especially when it comes to sharing your finances. This goes for close pals wanting to borrow money, being part of a (potentially very expensive) wedding party, going in on a beach house or even team projects, such as a charitable venture. Make sure that you know what you’re getting in to.

"
19 november 2016,aquarius,"Looking for a raise? Trying to boost your company’s revenues? Then get ready for action as Neptune finally bolts forward after a five-month nap in your earnings sector. Indecisive clients may now sign deals, bosses could approve promotions or you could launch a business idea that will bring home some serious bacon. But keep your ideas and negotiations under wraps, as profitable and helpful Venus is sequestered in your hush-hush house of confidentiality.

"
20 november 2016,aquarius,"Now that Mars is in your sign for the first time in two years, you’re a person on a mission. And today’s goal is to cut loose with people you adore and have some fun. Spontaneous Uranus urges you to pick up the phone and call someone, even if you haven’t spoken in awhile or they live on the other side of the planet. With the Sun entering the friendliest part of your chart tomorrow, it’s people–not material things –that will mean the most to you.

"

The cosmos delivers a gift to you today in the form of a Mercury-Saturn conjunction, a meeting of two intelligent and forward-thinking planets. The new few weeks will rock for socializing with existing pals, sharing ideas with industry colleagues, and meeting new faces (some of them sexy indeed). It’s also an auspicious time to plan your long range future, as the rose colored glasses will be off and logical thinking will prevail.

"
24 november 2016,aquarius,"No guts, no glory! Remaining hidden in a little protective shell isn’t the best way to go through life.

Happy-go-lucky Jupiter is now in your corner for the first time in 13 years, so it’s time to blossom.

"
25 november 2016,aquarius,"New people may start showing up in your life, both the business and the personal side. Your natural gregariousness may encourage you to warm up to them quickly, but is that wise? Hold back a bit, especially when it comes to your most private thoughts and big plans. Learn whom to trust before you share.

"
26 november 2016,aquarius,"The people in your orbit can be surprisingly lucky for you in the days ahead, so make every effort to get out there and spend time with them. A pal could introduce you to your future spouse, tip you off about a job opening or be a sounding board for some fresh ideas that you’d like some input on. Working with others on a team basis could also get you much further than flying solo, so consider partnering up.

"
27 november 2016,aquarius,"Ouch! Don’t step on anyone’s toes today, Aquarius. A tense Moon-Mars angle nay make you feel way  too big for your britches. Unless you want people calling you Mr. or Ms. Bossy Pants behind your back, keep the attitude dialed down a notch. You’re going to need people in your corner, especially with this week’s new moon falling in your house of networking and team efforts.

"
28 november 2016,aquarius,"You won’t be suffering from a shortage of energy, ambition and bright ideas, but your cash flow is another story altogether. Perform due diligence before you leap into anything with a price tag attached–college, having another baby, starting a business, that big vacation–as Neptune is clouding your vision. Make sure that you have plenty in the bank first and don’t run up your credit cards.

"
29 november 2016,aquarius,"Come out of your shell! The new moon in Sagittarius is all about meeting new people. Toss out preconceived notions about the “right type” of friend, lover or teammate. Now’s the time to start expanding your circle to folks who are different. Maybe they’re more creative, from a different ethnic group, or they espouse a contrasting philosophy to yours. They say that people make the world go round, and in your case, new pals can add a lot to your world.

"
30 november 2016,aquarius,"Slacker alert! Make sure that you don’t get the wrong end of the stick today as deceptive Neptune is playing games with all the signs of the zodiac. People around you may wimp out on their responsibilities, expecting you to soldier on bravely and pick up their slack. Sorry, it doesn’t work that way. Let them know that guilt, passive-aggressive antics and flattery aren’t going to work with you.

6 december 2016,aquarius,"With lovely Venus getting ready to enter your sign tomorrow, you’re looking like the cat’s pajamas. And as any cool cat can tell you, they draw admirers—kind of like catnip! Therefore, don’t be surprised if someone—a potential lover, boss or existing friend—calls you out of the blue with the aim of talking bidness, romance or just having fun. With spontaneous Uranus acting up, anything can happen.

"
7 december 2016,aquarius,"Oh yeah! Ain’t you the hottest thing on two legs. Sex bomb Venus just entered Aquarius, making you the person to watch! Since Venus governs beauty, the next three weeks are the perfect time to doll yourself up. Maybe a new hair style, some chic new outfits and some cosmetic procedures should be on the agenda. And while you’re at it, don’t forget a massage—and a glass of champagne is most definitely a prerequisite.

"
8 december 2016,aquarius,"“Adventure” is your middle name these days, Aquarius! With four celestial orbs pushing you to take risks as you focus on your most closely held desires, you may feel unstoppable. Fortunately you have a few other planets in the more cautious part of your chart, urging you to consider the moves you make. There’s nothing wrong with developing momentum as long as you take time outs now and then to assess your progress, as well as the practicality of your goals.

"
9 december 2016,aquarius,"It’s nothing but green lights ahead with a super Sun/Jupiter aspect. Big dreams can take flight as your efforts have been noticed by people who are decision makers. But even though the cosmos is encouraging you to team up with others, with Mars in Aquarius you can make a heck of a lot of headway on your own.

"
10 december 2016,aquarius,"Put a fork in it—it’s over.  Done, cooked, finished. A megawatt meeting between the Sun and Saturn helps you to finally put an end to anything or anyone in your life that is not adding to your journey, but instead is taking away. As a result today may feel heavy, because being honest with ourselves is not always an easy task. Sometimes we  are the problem and change must begin within. Consider this as a gift, however. The more toxic stuff you take to the trash now will free you up for a fabulous birthday season ahead.

"
11 december 2016,aquarius,"What do mac and cheese, hot chocolate and Grandma’s cookies all have in common? They’re comfort foods, along with homemade stews and soups. The cosmos tells you to get in touch with your warm and fuzzy side, that part of all of us that craves old fashioned comforts. Whether that means good food, good company or a beautifully decorated abode, nurturing yourself this way will provide some very happy psychological benefits.

"
12 december 2016,aquarius,"If you want to move ahead with certain passions and projects, the best way to go about it is to network. Talk to industry insiders, find a mentor or coach, ask a trusted friend for advice, let everyone know you’re looking for a mate. This is no time to sit at home on the couch waiting for the cavalry to ride in and rescue you. Serendipity rules today, so you never know who might be able to help you.

"
13 december 2016,aquarius,"Love is in the air with today’s full moon in your house of romance, but so is drama! Something may be coming to a close, such as moving from the dating stage to living together. If you want to keep your sanity in the weeks ahead it would be wise not to plunge into anything without calmly determining if the two of you are right for each other. With dynamic Mars just about ready to move into your house of security and guarantees, you’ll need to know for sure which way the wind is blowing.

"
14 december 2016,aquarius,"Too many chefs spoil the sauce! That’s the dilemma as you seem to be surrounded by people who all want their way, or at the very least for their voice to be heard. The noise may get louder in the days ahead, so if you need some quiet time to chill and consider what’s going on, take a break. The best time to do so is after the 19th when Mercury goes retrograde in your house of silence, reflection and closure. Use this valuable time period to see beneath the surface of things.

"
15 december 2016,aquarius,"Despite your desire to get things done, there could be interruptions today that stall your progress. With the Moon in the most efficient part of your chart you may get easily annoyed with the people or situations that are slowing you down. Take a deep breath and count to ten. When energetic Mars moves into your house of routines and protocols next week, you’ll be able to steamroll over things that are in your way.

"
17 december 2016,aquarius,"Put a ring on it? With the Moon in your commitment sector you may be interested—very interested—in the direction a certain relationship is going in. Maybe you want a baby, or another date, or more quality time with an amour. Now’s the time to talk about the future, and you may be surprised that even a commitment-phobic partner will open up.

"
18 december 2016,aquarius,"This is the last day in awhile that you’ll be hosting assertive Mars in your sign, so give some thought as to what you’d like to achieve in 2017. Your goals and dreams are paramount, but today a tense Moon-Mars angle indicates that you may be worried that others won’t go along with your plans. The reality may be that you  are the cause of your fears and concerns more so than others. When Mars enters Pisces tomorrow your sense of self-worth will increase.

"
19 december 2016,aquarius,"The planet Mars can act like a double edged sword and today it rolls into your house of money: making it, spending it and saving it. Play it safe and avoid the urge to spend, a strong possibility with the aggressive red planet here. Mercury retrogrades also in your house of confidentiality, making the next few weeks a good time to quietly seek a new job or research a business launch.

"
20 december 2016,aquarius,"With aggressive Mars now in your income sector you’re probably raring to go when it comes to earning more. But don’t move so quickly that you overlook all of the beneficial opportunities that are out there. Don’t assume that you have to grab the first deal that is offered to you, as over the next seven weeks there could be a number of them. Some of them may require some digging as they won’t be obvious, but the hunt could be worth it.

"
21 december 2016,aquarius,"If any sign of the zodiac needs some R&R these days it’s you, Aquarius! Not only do you need some peace and serenity, but according to the planets you could also benefit from some practical changes to your life. Which means examining your habits and routines to see if they’re making your life more discombobulated or more relaxed. Streamlined, well thought out habits make it easier to go through life on automatic pilot. Use the slow pace of next week to get your act together.

"
22 december 2016,aquarius,"Think before you speak as an emotional Moon-Jupiter connection could stir up deep seated feelings…and powerful words. Likewise, you could be on the receiving end of someone else’s strong opinions, which may not sit well with you. With a new moon arriving on the 29th in your house of healing and closure, you’d be wise to wait til then to sort out your thoughts.

"
23 december 2016,aquarius,"New Year’s Day is over a week away, but your mind may turn to increasing your cash flow in 2017. Maybe it’s the holiday spending, maybe it’s just the desire to feel more secure, but either way your motivation to save more will grow. Next week is perfect for setting aside some quiet time for strategizing.

"
24 december 2016,aquarius,"Speaking your mind and letting the world know what you’re all about should become easier in the weeks ahead. A sparkling and rare Saturn-Uranus aspect today helps kick off a period in which you can become more visible and respected. Tomorrow is even better for expressing yourself to friends, lovers and family.

"
25 december 2016,aquarius,"The cosmos has a sweet gift for you on Christmas Day, and it’s called renewed self esteem. Lovely and gentle Venus is in your sign, forming a number of positive aspects with other planets. It’s time for a new look, a different way of thinking and maybe even some new friends or business contacts. The 29th is a good day to start initiating conversations.

"
26 december 2016,aquarius,"It’s a super day to entertain discussions about a new job or a promotion that has more money attached, but you have to tread warily. Verbal Mercury is in the house of confidentiality, so keep a lid on your plans and negotiations. Furthermore, a tense standoff between Jupiter and Uranus warns that you shouldn’t come off as being too opinionated. And if you have some excellent ideas to propose, don’t put them on the table too soon. Get paid for your brilliance!

"
27 december 2016,aquarius,"Your intuition is on overdrive, and chances are it’s highly accurate too. This isn’t a temporary situation either, but something that you will be experiencing for the next three weeks. As a result pay close attention to gut hunches you receive. Today you might get a hunch about a financial situation that could pay off in spades.

"
28 december 2016,aquarius,"Life is too short to settle, Aquarius, and you may be getting tired of watching others have all the fun. If you find that you’ve been daydreaming quite a bit, imagining a happier future, it’s not surprising–tomorrow’s new moon is in the house of the subconscious mind. However, with ambitious Mars charging through your house of routines and planning, you may find it possible to take those dreams and make them a workable reality.

"
29 december 2016,aquarius,"If you’d like to start off 2017 without carrying a lot of emotional baggage with you, then today’s new moon in Capricorn is just the ticket for finding some peace of mind. Over the next two weeks you can dig deep and toss old, outdated ideas that have been weighing you down. With Mars and Neptune active in Pisces, an increased sense of self-esteem will emerge.

"
30 december 2016,aquarius,"Why are you holding back? Uranus just went direct in your house of self-expression, encouraging you to put yourself out there–your opinions, ideas, written pieces, artwork, proposals–but you don’t seem anxious to do so. It could be due to yesterday’s new moon in the house of the subconscious mind, stirring up doubts and insecurities. That’s OK. By New Year’s Day your confidence will return.

"
31 december 2016,aquarius,"To thine own self be true! It’s time to get back to the essence of who you really are, Aquarius. Quit worrying about what other people think about you and the roles they might want you to play. The recent new moon encouraged you to toss out old ways of thinking that no longer serve you, and this is one area that needs to be addressed.

"
1 january 2017,pisces,"Everyone had better get out of your way! With megawatt Mars meeting up with Neptune today in your sign, absolutely nothing is going to stop a Pisces this year from going after their ambitions. 2017 is all about your  needs and aspirations for once, so don’t feel selfish about pursuing your own dreams. And if having a juicier love life is part of your plan, magnetic Venus enters your house of amore on the 3rd for a one-month stay.

"
2 january 2017,pisces,"With the Moon forming a perfect angle today with Mars and Neptune, your spirits should be lifting. Maybe you’ve sold yourself short in the past, not really believing that you can pull off certain aspirations. But confidence should be creeping in to replace fear and doubt. When Venus enters your sign tomorrow you’ll feel even stronger.

"
3 january 2017,pisces,"Hey there, you sexy thang. It’s not enough that glamorous Neptune is in your house of self-image along with charismatic Mars. Hell no, now you Pisces folks have latched on to alluring Venus too! The planet of beauty and luxury has just entered your sign for four weeks. Remember that commercial for hair products, the one that said, “Don’t hate me because I’m beautiful”? Work it, Pisces. Let the haters hate!

"
4 january 2017,pisces,"With so much planetary firepower in your sign, you may be raring to go with your 2017 plans. Aggressive Mars in Pisces is saying, “Go, go, go!” but….Mercury retrogrades today in your house of ambition and success. This is a short window of time, just until the 12th, so spend a few days reconsidering your plans before you charge ahead

"
5 january 2017,pisces,"Show me the money! You may be ready to shout that from the rooftops as the Moon connects with rebellious Uranus in your income sector. But with Mercury currently in retrograde motion in your career house, being forceful about seeing more green could backfire. When the messenger planet goes direct on Sunday you’ll be in a much better spot to speak up. By the way, if you want to earn more.expand your contact list. There is definitely a “it’s not what you know, but who you know” vibe going on for Pisces right now.

"
6 january 2017,pisces,"Wrap up any major negotiations you have going on with a client or prospective employer. Put the finishing touches on a product, service, website or marketing plan you’ve been working on too. Mercury is retrograde in this part of your chart, a helpful aspect as it gives you time to review your activities. It resumes direct motion on Sunday, so get ready for forward movement.

"
7 january 2017,pisces,"Your sign is known for its ability to work well in solitude but the cosmos has another plan for you, Pisces. The Sun and Pluto meet up today in your eleventh house of teamwork, a highly auspicious aspect that can bring movers and shakers into all areas of your life. Consider joining an industry think tank or taking a seminar that will be full of like minded people. Join a charity or volunteer group with folks who share your passion for improving the world. Rally people in your neighborhood to create a community vegetable garden. But this is also the house of technology, so any kind of digital venture (such as an online store, blog, website or coding an app) can take off like a shot. With Pluto and the Sun involved, strategy is key.

"
8 january 2017,pisces,"Mmmm, the sweet smell of success. You might start catching a whiff of it now that Mercury is direct in your highly ambitious tenth house. Not all of the road blocks will be out of your way, but keep your eye on the big picture and keep pushing on. With mighty Mars in your sign you’re a force to be reckoned with–don’t forget that.

"
9 january 2017,pisces,"You’re the envy of the zodiac, Pisces, as you’re kicking off 2017 with dynamic Mars in your sign. If anyone ought to be off and running with audacious goals and plans it’s you! But the moody blues could strike as the Moon enters an emotional spot today, perhaps making you doubt yourself, or creating concern that you’re trying to take on too much. The good news is that power broker Pluto has your back and will help point out the flaws as well as the benefits in your actions. Sally forth.

"
10 january 2017,pisces,"You’re absolutely visionary these days Pisces, thanks to the Sun and Pluto both in your house of big ideas. The problem is that not everyone shares your vision, ambition or strategy as to how to get things done. As a result don’t expect everyone to sign on right away, but don’t give up hope either. When Mercury changes signs on Thursday you’ll be in a better position to make progress.

"
11 january 2017,pisces,"With aggressive Mars in your sign, you are definitely in the mood for getting things done. And with tomorrow’s full moon in your house of romance and enjoying life, you’ll be motivated to treat yourself to some good times with the people you love! However, friends and colleagues may not be on the same page, putting up resistance to your ideas. A group effort especially may start going off the rails, whether it’s planning a family reunion or a task force at the office. Not to worry. When Mercury enters Capricorn tomorrow you’ll be able to get it back on track.

"
12 january 2017,pisces,"Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou? Art thou on the same page as me? That may be the question in your mind as today’s full moon stars up drama in close relationships. A romance could be quite passionate, but where is it headed? Do you both want the same things? Singles need to watch the tendency to compare themselves to friends, or to rush into a romance out of loneliness. That being said, this lunation could bring out the passion and amour in all Pisces, so enjoy it!

"
13 january 2017,pisces,"Well ain’t you somethin’! The two most amorous planets in the solar system, Venus and Neptune, meet up today in Pisces, making you a sight for sore eyes. You should be feeling pretty frisky today as yesterday’s full moon fell in your house of romance. This is an excellent time for a makeover, as the lunation occurred in one of the most creative parts of your chart. Who would you like to be?

"
14 january 2017,pisces,"Sweet seduction! With the two most romantic planets, Venus and Neptune, meeting up in Pisces you’re more than ready to start living a more sizzling life. But it takes two to tango, and if your lover isn’t making your heart sing, you may need to make a big decision. When the Sun enters Aquarius next week you will enter into a deeply reflective stage, not only about love but life in general. If anything or anyone is making you unhappy you may quietly determine to move on. Take your time and think things over, as this vibe will continue into late February.

"
15 january 2017,pisces,"Love planet Venus is active today, prompting you to consider a makeover: a chic new hair style, a different look with makeup, perhaps a big wardrobe change. But do it for yourself, not someone else. You’re in quite an independent mood these days, and your self-image should be a manifestation of your authentic self, not what other people expect of you.

"
16 january 2017,pisces,"What about me? That thought may be on your mind as you realize that your own desires need to be met. Planets in your relationship and friends sectors are pushing you to be a team player, but at some point you just gotta look out for #1. Otherwise your resentment may bubble out of you like a volcano that’s releasing pent up steam. Once the Sun enters Aquarius on Thursday you’ll have four weeks of “me” time.

"
17 january 2017,pisces,"Megawatt Mars in your house of self-image is just the ticket for a makeover, so if you’re changing up your looks you know why. But the red planet also asks you to consider your image on a more emotional level. How intimate are you with a lover; how much do you share? Do you tend to dwell in unhappy thoughts? It’s time for some inner work, Pisces, something that will become more apparent after the Sun enters aquarius.

"
18 january 2017,pisces,"It’s time for an emotional tuneup! With healing Jupiter in the part of your chart that deals with cleansing your psyche, you can make headway today when it comes to improving your state of mind. This is just the beginning, however. This vibe continues well into February, right up to your birthday season. The new moon on the 27th can bring about a breakthrough.

"
19 january 2017,pisces,"Isaac Newton correctly stated that a body in motion will remain in motion unless a force stops it. That’s Newton’s First Law, and you’re going to get a taste of it today. The problem is that aggressive Mars is in your sign, wanting to put rocket boosters on your plans. But sober Saturn is the force that’s going to act against this, creating drag and friction. Red tape, indecisive or uncooperative people and circumstances that aren’t gelling could create frustration. Get used to it—this will be in play for at least another week. Relief arrives when Mars enters Aries on the 28th

"
20 january 2017,pisces,"Tone it down a notch, Pisces. Yes, Mars and Venus are in your sign, adding swagger to your step. But the Sun just entered your hush-hush twelfth house yesterday for a four-week stay. Bragging, showing off, getting in someone’s face, or even being open about your plans and goals have no place right now. Hide your light while you quietly work behind the scenes.

"
21 january 2017,pisces,"Nothing big in life is achieved by thinking small. Just ask any inventor, self-made millionaire, humanitarian or Nobel winning scientist, they’ll tell you—they had to firmly believe in the “beauty of their dreams”, to quote Eleanor Roosevelt. How expansive and visionary are your dreams? A happy Moon-Chiron aspect today helps you think bigger.

"
22 january 2017,pisces,"The planets are stirring up the depths of your subconscious mind, perhaps making you aware that changes need to be made with your thoughts and emotions. A helpful Moon-Sun aspect today helps you recognize that if you want to achieve certain ambitions, that you need a little help. Seek out the advice of an expert, whether it’s a self help author, a therapist or a wise mentor.

"
23 january 2017,pisces,"Your head and your heart may be pulling you in two different directions when it comes to a big goal or aspiration. Planetary influences recommend that you use your head more, as foggy Neptune could cloud your judgment. This is no time for rose colored glasses or pie in the sky thinking. Keep it real.

"
24 january 2017,pisces,"You’re in an excellent position to win people over to your side today, Pisces. Diplomacy and open conversations are the name of the game, so don’t be afraid to express your view point. Better yet is that you can come up with some creative solutions to problems that may have been plaguing you, a partnership or a group effort. Be sure to share them with others.

"
25 january 2017,pisces,"The upcoming new moon on Friday falls in the most reflective part of your chart, the twelfth house. This is where we make decisions to cut things from our lives that are no longer working or aren’t helping us on our journey. One of the biggest questions you need to ask yourself right now is about the company you keep. Who’s true blue, and who isn’t? Are there commitments that are taking up too much time, such as clubs or industry meetings? Are you hanging out with people who share your values? Take an inventory as the new moon will be a turning point.

"
26 january 2017,pisces,"Manage your emotions! Gentle Venus is in your house of self, encouraging you to get a better handle on your feelings. Jealousy, fear, obsession, anger, resentment, boredom, anxiety—whatever negative emotions and thoughts that you’re experiencing, it’s time for them to go. Fortunately Venus is linked today to optimistic Jupiter and with their help you can easily heal and release toxic patterns.

"
27 january 2017,pisces,"Healing, cleansing and nurturing—your tired body and mind need these desperately, and today’s new moon in Aquarius is your signal to slow down. Nobody can take better care of you than you, Pisces, and with disciplined Saturn by your side you can take charge of your progress. Set appointments with your doctor or masseuse. Confide in a good friend or a therapist. Take long walks in nature or spend a few hours immersed in a good book. Between now and August you’ll be able to see results as you become more serene and centered.

"
28 january 2017,pisces,"Your finances can take a turn for the better as dynamic Mars charges into your house of earnings today. Truth be told, you can spend too much when Mars is here, but as long as you keep a pragmatic eye on your wallet you should be OK. Chances are that you won’f find financial success by working alone. The planets recommend expanding your contact list via networking, especially reaching out to mentors and power brokers.

"
29 january 2017,pisces,"Some of your closest relationships can come under a microscope today as Mercury and Pluto meet up in your networking sector. Truth be told, under current planetary aspects you’re looking for only the true bluest of friends and colleagues. If you suspect that someone doesn’t have your best interests at heart, or that of the group, it may be time to make some changes. Between Mercury’s intelligence and Pluto’s ability to sniff out problems, you’ll be able to pull this off without a problem.

"
30 january 2017,pisces,"You could be in a dreamy state of mind as the Moon and Neptune combine their mystic energies. Which is fine….as long as you pay attention to the demands of your real life. Pour this misty energy into your sensuality while you keep your rational mind firmly focused on dollars and cents.

"
31 january 2017,pisces,"Does everyone in your circle know what their responsibilities are? Do they appreciate the need to stay on task and on budget? If you sense confusion or slacking off, it’s time to grab control before your plans go off the rails. You have too much invested in this to let that happen. Use your sixth sense to guide you as it’s right on target.

"
1 february 2017,pisces,"“Show me the money!”  Famous line from a movie, along with “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore!”. And that could be your mindset today, especially where your income is concerned. Hey, this can work in your favor if you channel your frustration about not having enough money into making more. The good news is that Venus, one of the planets that governs profits, is scheduled to move into your income house on Friday for an unusually long stay.

"
2 february 2017,pisces,"Speak now or forever hold your peace! Mouthy Mars is in your house of self-expression, so don’t hold back if something needs to be said. There’s no need to beat people over the head with your message, however. There’s a difference between speaking with aggression and speaking with passion. Choose passion and let your words shine.

"
3 february 2017,pisces,"Money talks and it should be talking to you—loudly—over the next few months. Today Venus enters your income sector, a boon for those of you looking for a higher paying gig or more robust revenues. While this could definitely help you pull in more cash, you’re advised to save and invest it carefully with Jupiter about to retrograde in your house of financial security next week. It’s an excellent time to get a side business going or a passive income stream.

"
4 february 2017,pisces,"If you and someone close need to get on the same page, this weekend is a good time to start. Jupiter will be heading retrograde in your intimacy sector on Monday were it will remain for four months. Your best bet is to clear the air between now and March 4th, after which time it will be tougher to reach an agreement.

"
5 february 2017,pisces,"It appears from your chart that you need a break, Pisces, and the cosmos is getting ready to give you one. Today a tense Moon-Neptune aspect may make you all too aware of the demands that your family or lover are placing on you. Fortunately Mercury enters your restorative twelfth house on Tuesday, letting you retreat into your own world for several weeks for some extreme self care.

"
6 february 2017,pisces,"The ancients in their wisdom placed “sharing” in the same astrological house—sharing bodies, emotions and financial assets. They understood that as people become more connected to each other, that their lives become intertwined in so many ways. Abundant Jupiter has been in this part of the sky since September but now retrogrades for four months, indicating that you need to take a second look at intimacy and net worth along with your romantic partner. Even if you’re single, it’s crucial to examine what you expect from a lover and to build a strong financial base. Slow down, cut back on spending, research investments, talk things over, examine emotions like jealousy and resentment and heal your soul. By early June you’ll be in a much different place.

"
7 february 2017,pisces,"If there was ever a time to flush negative emotions and thought patterns down the toilet, it’s now, Pisces. Mercury just entered your twelfth house of cleansing and closure where it will remain for the next three weeks. Truth be told, this could be an intense time, but getting to the root of unease is never effortless. The good news is that this Friday’s eclipse will help you develop solid habits that will enable you to move forward.

"
8 february 2017,pisces,"Sometimes it seems as though our plans and dreams are never going to work out, which certainly can lead to frustration and sadness. Today a tense Moon-Pluto aspect could make you feel that way, but know that this soon shall pass. Friday’s lunar eclipse in Leo will give you a swift kick in the pants, motivating you to take greater control as you come up with a logical plan of action.

"
9 february 2017,pisces,"Inspiration strikes, and it has dollar signs attached. Pay attention to any ideas that seem to come from the ether as they could be be worth their weight in gold. This vibe continues into the weekend, and Friday’s lunar eclipse is an added benefit. It falls in your highly efficient house of getting things done. Get inspired, then create a plan and work it.

"
10 february 2017,pisces,"It’s time to get your act together, Pisces—big time. Unbalanced checkbooks, cluttered closets, work piling up on your desk, a flabby tummy, e-mails that need to be deleted, employees that need to be excessed—all of this has to go, pronto. Tonight’s lunar eclipse in Leo will kick you square in the pants and make you get moving, whether you want to or not! But this is a happy lunation, so chances are that you’ll be motivated to dive in. It’s an excellent aspect for improving your health too, and you may discover that new habits are easier to establish than expected.

"
11 february 2017,pisces,"Tremendous emotional healing can take place in the days ahead if you’re open to the idea. Jupiter’s retrograde spin is designed to help you release old pent-up feelings, including anger and resentment. Developing strong friendships is also in the stars, so reach out to people who are simpatico.

"
12 february 2017,pisces,"As Valentine’s Day approaches, many people have love on their minds. But you may be taking a rather hard headed approach toward romance as it appears that you want more control over what goes on in your love life. The Moon might be making you feel testy today, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Who wants to feel as though they have no say-so in their relationship? The 14th helps you get everything out on the table.

"
13 february 2017,pisces,"Some adjustments need to be made to a romantic alliance. You have needs and desires that must be met, Pisces, so if you’re selling yourself short it’s time for a wakeup call. The same goes for singles who have been more worried about pleasing a lover than themselves. Tomorrow is a good day to call the shots in love, but you won’t have to be forceful about it.

"
14 february 2017,pisces,"What can I say? Pull down the shades, Pisces, because the Moon and Jupiter are both in your sexy eighth house for Valentine’s Day. But with other planets in your house of tradition and luxury, you’ll also want to go the champagne and candlelight route for dinner. Singles, a serious contender is on the horizon but it may take some “digging” to find them. Is it possible there’s someone you’ve been overlooking?

"
15 february 2017,pisces,"First, the good news: Mars is in your income sector for the first time in two years. This can help you land a raise or increase revenues. Now for the bad news: Mars in this part of the sky can run up spending. Today, a dicey Jupiter opposition could make you overly optimistic about your financial picture, to the point where you might spend money you shouldn’t. Keep the credit cards hidden and avoid borrowing money if you possibly can. You have excellent aspects for earning more, but you need to sock some cash away first.

"
16 february 2017,pisces,"Your intuition will be spot on about a career or money matter, so go with your gut. With the Sun about to enter your sign your self-esteem should be on the rise. Be more willing to take chances as they could pay off handsomely.

"
17 february 2017,pisces,"Your birthday season is about to begin, but you seem to be harboring doubts about whether some exciting new changes will take place or not. They will, and your confidence on that score will rise next week. However, the cosmos is going to demand that you become more structured about going after your dreams, so get ready for some discipline.

"
18 february 2017,pisces,"Woo-hoo! Your official birthday season is here, Pisces. Get ready for an exciting month ahead, especially with the last solar eclipse in your sign on the 26th. Chances are that you’re not the same old guy or gal you were back in 2015 when this series of eclipse began. It’s time to strut your stuff and take ownership of your power. You’re going to surprise a lot of people, but hey, they could use some shaking up.

"
19 february 2017,pisces,"Now that the Sun is in your sign you can start taking action on things that mean a lot to you. However, with chatty Mercury in your house of secrecy (an oxymoron to be sure), you shouldn’t be blabbing your ideas to everyone, at least for the next few days. Keep your cards close to your vest, especially on Wednesday.

"
20 february 2017,pisces,"Confusion about money matters or the direction your career is heading in could clear up, and quickly at that. Intelligent Mercury will be in your house of intuition just for one more week, so use it to your advantage. Today genius Uranus sends sparkling beams to Mercury, so get ready to get inspired. A smart income boosting idea could come your way.

"
21 february 2017,pisces,"Some quiet reflection could go a long way as you make the decision to start treating yourself better. Meditation, yoga, mindfulness, reiki, prayer–all of these can work wonders. Go within; your soul is waiting for you.

"
22 february 2017,pisces,"All that glitters is not gold, Pisces. Be discerning about the people you spend time with and your plans for the future. Often times we stick with certain people and goals out of habit, when in actuality we have outgrown them. If something or someone no longer holds a dazzling allure for you, acknowledge it–then adjust and move on.

"
23 february 2017,pisces,"With stern Saturn in your house of authority you’re in no mood for dealing with nonsense and game playing. However, a diplomatic Mercury-Saturn meet up will enable you to get your point across without offending the sensitive egos of others. They’d better get used to hearing your opinion in the weeks ahead.

"
24 february 2017,pisces,"Get a good idea as to where you want to head with your finances over the next six months. Sunday’s solar eclipse occurs in your sign, the last one in a series that began in 2015. A hush-hush meeting of the Moon and profits planet Venus today bodes well for some quiet strategizing.

"
25 february 2017,pisces,"Your birthday season is going to take off like a house on fire over the next few days, Pisces. First, sociable Mercury enters your sign today, helping you focus on your personal goals and desires. Then a solar eclipse tomorrow will wipe the slate clean, enabling you to move away from past dramas. It’s time to move on.

"
26 february 2017,pisces,"You’re not the same person you used to be, Pisces. A series of eclipses in your sign over the past two years has pushed you into new places that are destined to bring about immense personal growth. It may not have been easy, and you may not understand yet why certain things have happened, but today the last eclipse in this series takes place. Between now and August you could manifest important new connections and circumstances.

"
27 february 2017,pisces,"Yesterday’s solar eclipse in your sign lit a fire under you to get moving with your plans, but take it slow today. Aggressive Mars is in one hellacious mood, meeting up with his unpredictable brother-in-arms, Uranus. It’s the perfect storm for doing something stupid, like quitting the day job to open a tiki bar on an island somewhere. Or yelling at the boss that you deserve a raise, and dammit, when are you going to see it? Chill, grasshopper.

"
28 february 2017,pisces,"Slow and steady wins the race, Pisces. Don’t let others rush you into getting things done, as mistakes will be made—and you’ll get stuck cleaning them up. The recent solar eclipse in your sign has no doubt inspired you to get moving on a lot of personal plans, so focus on your own goals rather than getting sucked in to the agendas of other people.

"
1 march 2017,pisces,"What a week you’ve been having, Pisces! Last Sunday there was a solar eclipse in your sign, and today the Sun and Neptune meet up there. It’s all good—amazing, actually. Considering that Neptune is the planet of inspiration, your desire to try new things and stretch past old limits should be increasing. Saturday is a good time to talk to mentors, friends or industry experts about some of the interesting plans you’re coming up with.

"
2 march 2017,pisces,"Rage against the machine? You could be in one heck of a rebellious mood, courtesy of an epic Jupiter-Uranus smackdown. If you perceive that anything or anyone is holding you back—your job, a lover, society, your parents, the system—chances are you’ll be ready to bolt. However, don’t make any quick decisions under this aspect. Venus retrogrades this weekend in your sign, giving you four weeks to ponder your next move.

"
3 march 2017,pisces,"Is it time to add to the tribe? A happy Moon-Pluto aspect encourages you to reach out to some new folks and make their acquaintance. Over the next week a number of fresh contacts can be made in all areas of your life. You never know where these connections might take you. Getting introduced to your future spouse, hearing about a job opening or enjoying the company of close confidantes are all possible.

"
4 march 2017,pisces,"Keep a close eye on expenses over the next four weeks as Venus retrogrades today in your income sector. If a major expense can wait, then hold off, as your money situation could not be as robust as you’d like. Naturally this includes luxury items as our gal Venus is fond of swag. Do you share your finances with someone else? All the more reason to be careful as disagreements may arise about spending and saving. That said, Monday is a good day to interview or ask for a raise.

"
5 march 2017,pisces,"Benjamin Franklin wants to be your new BFF, Pisces. He wants to get real close to you–like in your wallet. Gotta love it when the cosmos is trying to dump more money in your lap, and that’s what’s happening today with a highly motivating Mars-Saturn trine. Want to see more green? Then do what’s necessary: update your resume, ask for a raise, start the business.

"
6 march 2017,pisces,"Venus may have gone retrograde in your house of feeling safe and secure, but that doesn’t mean that you should suffer in silence. Heck no! As a matter of fact today is the perfect time to speak up and let others know how you feel. If you need to bounce some ideas off a friend, do so on Wednesday or Thursday, optimal days for receiving sound advice.

"
7 march 2017,pisces,"Group activities can pick up steam this week, such as planning a family reunion or wedding, a girls-only trip to Vegas or a departmental project at the office. But there could be some “creative differences” today. Relax. It’s a temporary situation, one that will be gone as the week progresses.

"
8 march 2017,pisces,"With chatty Mercury and the feisty Sun both in your sign, you’re no wallflower these days Pisces! A terrific aspect today encourages you to expand your social network. It’s a great time to get involved in a charity or volunteer effort, as Pluto is active in your humanitarian eleventh house. Find an exercise buddy, start a book club, hook up with an accountability partner, become a soccer coach. The more you give of yourself the more you’ll get back. It’s a universal law.

"
9 march 2017,pisces,"Go loud and proud or go home, Pisces. Megawatt (and megamouth) Mars moves into your talkative house of expression today, its first visit here in two years. This is one of your best times all year to socialize (for fun as well as for making profitable new connections), self promote, blog, take classes, teach, write or get involved in the graphic arts. With so much planetary action bubbling away in your income sector, you might want to think about how to bring home more cash. It’s not going to land on your doorstep, so use this Martian influence to go out there and earn it.

"
10 march 2017,pisces,"Switch up the way you communicate with bosses, clients and colleagues, Pisces. Aim for a more congenial tone. No one is accusing you of being difficult or arrogant, however. Just play the diplomat, as this role will help you out more in the months ahead than playing the lone wolf card. With the Sun about to enter your income sector you need to work well with other people.

"
11 march 2017,pisces,"The smart Pisces makes an attempt to work out financial or personality issues with a partner today (and that includes business alliances). Don’t let wishful thinking blind you to the realities of your budget, expenses or emotional state. Otherwise the full moon in Virgo tomorrows bring them to a rolling boil. From your chart it appears that you’re the one who’s going to have to play the heavy.

"
12 march 2017,pisces,"Moving closer, or further apart? Today’s full moon in your commitment sector can be a game-changer. If a romance has been less than fulfilling you may decide to move on. On the other hand, this lunation could increase your resolve to find common ground and become even more secure. One thing that you’re NOT going to want is someone else calling the shots. Advocate for yourself.

"
13 march 2017,pisces,"Time to talk turkey! Now that oh-s0-verbal Mercury is in your income sector, let it be known that you are actively seeking more dinero. Whether you ask the boss for a raise or decide to find a new gig, your options for earning more are excellent. Get your resume and your act together. Once the Sun rolls into this part of the sky on the 29th, things will start to move.

"
14 march 2017,pisces,"In order for you to develop a solid financial foundation, you have to make sure that you have an emergency fund for unexpected expenses. Something could happen today that will make this clear! You also need to create a cushion for larger projects that may require more cash than you had planned. Today’s aspects tell you to create a nice cushion.

"
15 march 2017,pisces,"It’s a good day to clear the air with a loved one, and to put an end to a drama or discussion that has been going on for far too long. There won’t be any tears or screaming necessary, just a calm but authoritative manner on your part. Try to maintain this aura as the week continues, as it looks like colleagues and even bosses may need to be set straight.

"
16 march 2017,pisces,"Thinking about chucking it all and moving into a beach shack somewhere? Or maybe you’re day dreaming about getting out of the rat race and following an entrepreneurial dream. Or finding Mr. Right and sailing off into the sunset. No problem, folks! Just be aware that a tough aspect tomorrow could bring resistance to your ideas. That, however, doesn’t mean that they won’t work.

"
17 march 2017,pisces,"Just how skilled are you, Pisces? As a mother, or a student, or as an employee? Regardless of the role you play, there is room for improvement in all areas of our lives. Take an honest assessment. With disciplined Saturn in your most ambitious sector, you can definitely make headway, provided you buckle down and develop the necessary skills.

"
18 march 2017,pisces,"Ahh, the sweet smell of newly minted greenbacks. The crisp sound they make as you stack them and place a few Benjamins in your wallet. Get ready to see more green, Pisces, and it ain’t because spring is coming. The Sun is just about to enter your income sector on Monday, but the fun really begins today. Profitable Venus holds a conversation with shrewd Mercury about how to increase your bottom line. Start coming up with a plan.

"
19 march 2017,pisces,"You can start making some serious coin once the Sun enters Aries tomorrow, but first you need to figure out a game plan. Strict Saturn is active today, telling you to put aside emotions and just go with the facts. Forget what other people around you say and what they want. In the weeks ahead others will try to pull you off course. Are they worth it?

"
20 march 2017,pisces,"Hopefully you used the energy of your birthday season to figure out your next moves. Now that the Sun is in Aries, it’s time to press forward with them, which will require some smart new habits and routines. Aries is your second house of practicality and stability, which includes financial strength. This is your best time all year to land a new job, raise or revenue stream for your business. But hustle now before the April retrogrades (four of them!) begin.

"
22 march 2017,pisces,"“It’s not my job!” Get ready for that attitude over the next few days as others slack or refuse to conform. Likewise, people may not agree on the direction a project should be heading in. You’ll bee able to get them on track by next Tuesday.

"
23 march 2017,pisces,"You have a vision as to where you’re going. More than that, you have a plan. Unfortunately, you may face resistance to your dreams today and tomorrow as intelligent Mercury squares stubborn Pluto. Someone may try to pull rank or try to convince you that your ideas aren’t worth pursuing. Please! You know better than that. As a matter of fact, the new moon next Tuesday is perfect for gaining more traction. Onward and upward.

"
24 march 2017,pisces,"Your mind should be on money, thanks to intelligent Mercury in your income and savings sector. This is one of your best years in over a decade to build a strong financial portfolio, but the planets warn that you need to get real about debt, retirement accounts and benefits packages. There’s no point in earning more if you don’t have a solid plan for creating wealth. Fortunately next week’s new moon will help you develop some solid, practical habits and solutions.

"
25 march 2017,pisces,"No one likes feeling insecure when it comes to love, their job status or their financial situation. Nor do they enjoy feelings of low self-worth. Well, if you’re feeling that way change can start right now, thanks to a fortuitous meeting of Venus and the Sun. New opportunities to expand your income and to feel better about romance will come your way over the next six months, right after Tuesday’s new moon in Aries.

"
26 march 2017,pisces,"Leave an hour or so free today, Pisces, as the universe is getting ready to inspire you. Brilliant money-making ideas could come your way: an invention, an idea for a new company, a place to send your resume, a different field to enter. Your previous ideas of what you are capable of are changing. It’s time to take a bigger bite out of life! Start thinking and strategizing.

"
27 march 2017,pisces,"“If you don’t ask, you don’t get.” Ever hear that saying? It applies to you this week, Pisces, so repeat it until it sinks in! Assertive Mars in your chatty third house is encouraging you to speak up for yourself. No need to be angry or dictatorial, though, with dreamy Neptune in your house of self-image. You can make your point with ease and politeness.

"
28 march 2017,pisces,"The cosmos blesses each sign with one new moon a year in the income sector, and today is your lucky day, Pisces. Over the next few months you could land a promotion, raise or new job. Self-employed Pisceans could dream up a new revenue stream or sign on some profitable clients. Helping matters is the nearby presence of Venus, smoothing over bumps on the journey ahead and greasing the wheels of making connections with influential people.

"
29 march 2017,pisces,"Long range goals and dreams get a cosmic boost from the meeting of intelligent Mercury and stable Saturn. This is an excellent week to shop for a new job, make presentations to big shots, ask the boss for a raise or develop a new income stream for your business. The deals you negotiate have long term ramifications, so take your time and make the right decisions.

"
30 march 2017,pisces,"An energetic Moon-Mars connection could turn you into a motor mouth, which is not a good idea under current planetary conditions. You run the risk of revealing too much. This includes online conversations and social media posts, so think before you hit “send”. People may be pushing your buttons, so it could be tempting to respond or vent to someone else. Don’t go there.

"
31 march 2017,pisces,"Boosting your income is the goal of the cosmos, thanks to Mars, the Sun, a recent new moon, and Uranus all packed into your second house of earnings and saving cash. And today strategic Mercury zips into your communications sector, a super placement for negotiating, holding meetings and self-promotion. Hustle now, before the messenger planet goes retrograde on April 9th.

"
1 april 2017,pisces,"Got something to say or express? Then make haste, Pisces. Verbal Mercury enters your communication sector today but goes retrograde on the 9th. As a result, negotiate with clients, try to settle that argument with your brother, e-mail your resume to a decision maker, and finish your thesis. The retro period runs from the 9th til the 18th–not a long time, but long enough to slow things down.

"
2 april 2017,pisces,"Time for a personal rewrite or makeover? If you’re itching to start afresh–with a new attitude, look or occupation–then today’s retrograde movement of Venus into your sign is just the ticket. You can really have a lot of fun with this, especially considering that next week’s full moon falls in your house of passion and libido. It may be time for a sexier, more confident you to be strutting down the street!

"
3 april 2017,pisces,"If you’ve been feeling like you want to cut loose from responsibility so that you can enjoy the lighter side of life, then by all means do so. A frisky Moon-Neptune trine will make you amorous, adventurous and maybe even a tad dangerous! (In a good way, that is.) Enjoy this energy, as by Thursday you’ll have to deal with more pragmatic matters.

"
4 april 2017,pisces,"Something might happen that will make you feel unsettled about love. If you’re looking for guarantees or a steady calm pace, that may be elusive over the next week. The full moon in Libra next week will bring things to a head, so get ready to hold some serious conversations.

"
5 april 2017,pisces,"Don’t become too influenced by the opinions of other people. Some of them may mean well, but they don’t know you as much as you know yourself. There is deep wisdom within–seek it, nurture it and work with it. Mentors have their place but in the long run it all comes down to you.

"
6 april 2017,pisces,"Do you really want what you’re going after? Sometimes we become so fixated on a plan or goal that we don’t realize that we’ve outgrown it. Now that Saturn is retrograde in your tenth house of ambition it’s time to take a second look at your plans. You may need to conduct research, talk to mentors or become more skilled . Slowing down and taking a review could end up being one of the smartest things you can do in 2017.

"
7 april 2017,pisces,"With the mighty Sun in your income sector you’re probably anxious to earn more. Maybe too  anxious! A problematic Sun-Jupiter aspect could find you creating unrealistic plans for the future when it comes to your career, company or savings plan. A bank may not come through with a loan, people could back out of a project or revenues could take longer to appear than you might expect. Take all of this into consideration as you make future plans.

"
8 april 2017,pisces,"You may need to seize the reins when it comes to any kind of group activity or team effort—unless, of course, you want to get run over by its members. Power struggles may erupt—within a family, a volunteer organization, a committee at work or even your friends. You may not want to be the group leader, but it’s also not wise to stand along the sidelines hoping that everything will just work out. It won’t, so exert some of your influence without getting in too deep.

"
9 april 2017,pisces,"Zip your lips! Chatty Mercury retrogrades in your communication sector, so the opportunity for screw-ups is high: sending a snarky e-mail about your boss to  your boss by mistake. Revealing a confidence (yours or someone else’s) when it should have remained quiet. Launching a sales campaign before all the kinks have been worked out. But the good thing is that you can use this energy to polish up your skills, such as public speaking, blogging or Photoshop. This period ends on the 20th, so plan accordingly.

"
10 april 2017,pisces,"Try to kiss and make up with people you’ve been at odds with recently, even if they have wronged you. Part of the problem is that Venus has been retrograde in your self-image sector, perhaps making you feel insecure. That’s about to change when the golden planet moves direct this coming Saturday. You’ll be feeling better in no time.

"
11 april 2017,pisces,"Tonight’s full moon is superb for kicking off a prosperous new chapter with your finances and career, so by all means start hustling. But choose your friends, colleagues and clients carefully as Pluto is in a tough spot. You will need the assistance of others as you forge ahead, but you can still be choosy. Make sure you know who you’re dealing with.

"
12 april 2017,pisces,"You could use a new challenge, Pisces, something that shows off your talent and makes you feel good about yourself again. Something might present itself over the next few days that fits this bill. Not only that, some fresh opportunities for making more money could suddenly appear, so keep your eyes and ears open.

"
13 april 2017,pisces,"Finding a solution or compromise should be easier than usual with a helpful Moon-Pluto aspect. From your chart it appears that you need to lay down some rules with the people in your world, otherwise they’ll run you ragged. Progress can be made without a lot of drama and screaming–today, anyhow! Tomorrow is another story.

"
14 april 2017,pisces,"You may becoming increasingly fed up with a boss, client or co-workers, but blasting them back to the Stone Age may not be your smartest move right now. With maverick Uranus acting up today, someone may pull a stunt that will throw you off your game. Keep calm and carry on. When Venus resumes direct motion in you sign tomorrow, it will be your show, not their’s.

"
15 april 2017,pisces,"Damn, you look good. And you should feel good too. Glamorous Venus has just gone direct in your first house of image and self-esteem, wrapping up a six-week retro period that may have made you feel less than sexy and attractive. Your thinking should become clearer and as a result, the path ahead is a straight one. March on, Pisces!

"
16 april 2017,pisces,"Super day to talk things over with your honey–or shop for a new one if you’re in the market! A sweet Mars-Venus aspect is just the ticket for romance. Plan a three day weekend sometime soon with your amour. Flirt outrageously with that potential new mate. It’s all about living in the moment, so get out there and enjoy life.

"
17 april 2017,pisces,"If there was ever a day to make a smoking hot impression on others, it’s today, Pisces! The two most stable and influential orbs in the solar system form a harmonious trine: the Sun and Saturn. It’s a smart time to ask for the job, the raise, the order or the contract. Research new opportunities and figure out how you can develop more influence within  your industry.

"
18 april 2017,pisces,"Don’t let a friend or colleague strong arm you into doing something that meets their agenda. They may not be above preying on your emotions to get what they want, so stand firm. With the Sun entering your communications sector tomorrow you’ll be in a great position to let people know what’s on your mind, and the expectations you have of them.

"
19 april 2017,pisces,"Your life is about to become a heck of a lot more social now that the Sun is in your house of buzzing around the neighborhood, hanging out with friends and talking up a storm. Just be careful what you post online as Pluto is about to retrograde in your technology sector. Likewise, if you’re not sure that a friend can keep a confidence then zip your lips. Otherwise you can enjoy a sparkling time ahead, especially with family and loved ones.

"
20 april 2017,pisces,"You’ll be seeking security over the next few weeks now that Mercury is retrograde, and one of the places you’ll be seeking it is in your personal relationships. This includes friends and business contacts as well as a lover. Are you all on the same page? Is anyone on a power trip, trying to gain control over a relationship or group activity? If they are, you’re not going to be quiet about it. Nor should you. Wait till the new moon on the 26th to let them know what you think.

"
21 april 2017,pisces,"Feeling emo? It’s a strong possibility in the weeks ahead as red hot Mars is now in your sector of comfort and security, stirring things up. Family dramas may come to the fore along with relationship issues, so you might want to start a mindfulness meditation practice! Mercury just went retro in another sector that deals with security so between now and May 3rd you may feel out of sorts, maybe even fearful of where things are heading. Just remember that fears are not always the same as reality, and that Mercury will resume direct motion on May 3rd.

"
22 april 2017,pisces,"Feeling lazy and languorous? Can’t think of anything better to do than to kick back and relax? You know, breakfast in bed, binge watching Netflix, or a nice long juicy gossip session with a friend? Sorry! Get-real Saturn warns that you better get some work done around the house or at the office. Oh, and he’s doing the same next week, so get ready to be productive.

"
23 april 2017,pisces,"They say that loving yourself is the greatest love of all. While some folks may think that this sounds egotistical, it’ s really not. This is about self-esteem and being proud of the person you’ve become, and a happy Moon-Venus aspect will start putting a smile on your face. Things get even better next Friday when Venus glides into your house of dignity.

"
24 april 2017,pisces,"Back to the drawing board! Both Mercury and Saturn are retrograde in sectors that deal with your career and making more money, but today they form a terrific aspect. Revise your resume, analyze past revenues and cash flow, make follow up phone calls to prospects, finish up old projects and strategize for the near future. Once Wednesday’s new moon comes around you should be in heavy self-promotion mode.

"
25 april 2017,pisces,"There are good surprises when it comes to money and bad surprises. We never have to prepare ourselves for the good ones though, do we? But that’s what the cosmos has on offer for you today, some kind of happy event which can improve your cash flow. Maybe you hear about a job opening at another company. Perhaps you hit upon an idea for a product you could patent, or a company to start. This energy lasts for several weeks so don’t waste it.

"
26 april 2017,pisces,"Your career can take flight as a number of positive aspects over the next few days puts your ambitions in focus. First, an energetic Uranus-Saturn trine could bring about a sudden (but profitable) change: a job offer, promotion or landing a new client. Then a new moon occurs today in your house of strategizing and negotiating, helping you connect with others to pursue a common goal. Then on Friday Venus glides into your income sector. Gotta love it! But nothing will happen unless you hustle, so get moving.

"
27 april 2017,pisces,"People in high places might be willing to help you but you’re going to have to make the first move. A sparkling Moon-Pluto trine helps you make the right connections, say the best words and think of the savviest strategy. This isn’t a one-day deal, however; keep at it over the next three weeks as this is one of your best times all year to make progress.

"
28 april 2017,pisces,"Romantic relationships can now become more grounded, thanks to Venus entering the stable second house. Try to establish more of a “date night” routine with your lover. Singles, this aspect encourages you to find a serious partner, not some fly-by-night fling. All Pisces are going to be looking fro more financial stability with this aspect, whether it’s on your own or with joint assets.

"
29 april 2017,pisces,"With so much planetary activity pushing you to achieve your ambitions, you may be neglecting some of the people around you—or even yourself. Find a balance this weekend between your personal life and your goals. Venus just entered your income sector, so the opportunity to earn more is high. But you need to keep others happy and recharge your batteries as well.

"
30 april 2017,pisces,"Get in touch with your inner Warhol! Or Bon Jovi, Jagger, Kahlo, Pollock, Da Vinci……. That’s because the passionate Moon is in the most creative part of your chart this weekend, telling you to schedule more hobby time. And if that means signing up for a class you should do that too. Life’s too short to always be using the left side of your brain.

"
1 may 2017,pisces,"Swag alert! Keep your wallet locked up tight as you could be tempted to splurge on luxury items or things that simply aren’t necessary right now. Logical Mercury is retrograde in your spending and savings sector, pointing out your weaknesses when it comes to fiscal planning. Stick to purchasing the essentials.

"
2 may 2017,pisces,"With aggressive Mars tearing through your domestic sector, you may be hell bent on turning your home into a castle, or your yard into a green paradise. Today the Moon is in the most efficient part of your chart, so don’t be surprised if a sudden burst of inspiration hits you to get organized. Mercury has been retrograde in your habits sector for the past few weeks, asking you to streamline and develop better routines.

"
3 may 2017,pisces,"Gotta love it—Mercury resumes direct motion in your income sector, loosening up logjams that may have been preventing you from earning more. The Sun and inspirational Neptune also form a terrific aspect in your houses of self-promotion, branding and image. Don’t waste this opportunity—let the world know that you’ve got the goods.

"
4 may 2017,pisces,"You’re in a take-charge mood these days, which is a good thing. But it would still be smart to get advice from other people. Don’t worry, you won’t have to do everything they suggest. Pick and choose from the pieces of information you receive and put the most practical ones in place.

"
5 may 2017,pisces,"Need to revisit an issue with someone close? Then get on it. Now that the Sun is in the most verbal part of your chart you can finally say what’s been on your mind, even if you were reluctant to say your piece before this. Jupiter is retrograding through one of the most emotional parts of your chart, helping you come to grips with deep seated feelings. Let them out.

"
6 may 2017,pisces,"What you want and what others want from you seem to be two separate things this weekend, Pisces. You’re feeling rather domineering with strict Saturn in your authoritative tenth house, but that’s not the same thing as being dictatorial. Don’t back down. People around you may resort to guilt or other manipulative techniques, but it’s not your karma to kowtow to everyone.

"
7 may 2017,pisces,"Feeling good about yourself is a heck of lot easier when the Moon and abundant Jupiter are embracing, and that’s what they’re doing today Pisces! Not only that glamorous Neptune turns up the heat in your self-image sector, advising a bit of a makeover. What are you waiting for? This week’s full moon falls in your house of taking risks!

"
8 may 2017,pisces,"Intelligent, logical Mercury is transiting through one of the most practical parts of your chart, demanding that you establish and stick to good habits. The problem is that your more emotional side just wants to play. Find a balance and figure out how to do both! The full moon on Wednesday can take you to some exciting new places in life, but you’ll need to work to get there.

"
9 may 2017,pisces,"Need a favor? Want to be rubbing elbows with the right kind of people? Then get out there and start mingling, as a terrific Sun-Pluto trine can help you make some scintillating new connections. Tomorrow’s full moon adds rocket boosters to this scene, so keep up the momentum over the next few weeks.

"
10 may 2017,pisces,"Feel like packing your bags and heading off on an adventure? Blame it on the full moon in Scorpio, which is stirring up wanderlust and the desire to learn more about the world—and to experience more too. Hiding in the shadows is not where you’re coming from these days. Better yet is that your social life is about to pick up steam as Pluto in your networking sector is trying to bring new faces into your life. This could be in love, business, volunteer work, the neighborhood or friendship. You might even hear some good news about a raise or an offer of employment, so get ready for some big changes.

"
11 may 2017,pisces,"Don’t kid yourself about an emotional issue, Pisces. A difficult Mars-Neptune aspect could find you putting on the rose colored glasses. Placing someone on a pedestal, pretending that a problem doesn’t exist, or allowing someone to use guilt as part of their agenda is all a possibility today. But you have other planets in some “get real” sectors trying to bring not only logic your way, but a sense of authority—and dignity.

"
12 may 2017,pisces,"There’s an old Etta James song that goes like this: “I want a Sunday kind of love..a love to last past Saturday night. And I’d like to know it’s more than love at first sight. I want a Sunday  kind of love.” This song popped into my mind as I started to write your daily scope. With desirous Mars in your sector of nesting, and abundant Jupiter in your house of intimacy and bonding, you want a lover to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon with, someone who will always be there.

"
13 may 2017,pisces,"Fear can actually be helpful at times, as it keeps us from going where angels fear to tread. But when it paralyzes us unnecessarily you have to be aware what it’s doing to you. Fortunately subterranean Pluto is in a good spot, helping you recognize your blind spots and the places where worry and fear sneak in and take over. If there has been something that you’ve wanted to do for some time now, release the brakes.

"
14 may 2017,pisces,"Just how far do you want to go when it comes to sharing your deepest thoughts with someone close? Considering that Mercury is just about to enter the chattiest part of your chart you could become quite verbal. But words may stick in your throat when you try to communicate with a lover or good friend. Fortunately subterranean Pluto is on the job, helping you pinpoint the right way to go about it.

"
15 may 2017,pisces,"A lot has been said about manifesting, and today’s cosmic activity recommends that you “send it out to the universe”, “it” being the dreams you hold dear. But this isn’t some metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. By all means talk to people, let them know what you’re trying to attain and search for mentors who can help you along the way. But creating a vision board is a terrific visual reminder of what you’re aiming for.

"
16 may 2017,pisces,"Witty banter, story telling, chatting people up, cocktails and brunches—who wants in on this scene? Yeah, I thought so. And this is what you can enjoy, Pisces, now that convivial Mercury is in your social third house through June 6th. Of course, you can use this energy for talking to (and impressing) potential bosses and clients. This is one of your best times all year for strategizing and schmoozing. Use it wisely.

"
17 may 2017,pisces,"If you’re seeking an answer to a problem the best place to look is within. Your own wisdom can provide you with the guidance you need, assuming that you can still your mind long enough to tap into the source. Meditate, take a walk in nature, or keep a dream journal. You’re craving more comfort and guarantees these days: this is an excellent way to find it.

"
18 may 2017,pisces,"Due diligence! Dig deep, Pisces, especially if you’re on the verge of signing some important financial documents— for a mortgage, car loan, line of credit, or entering into a business partnership. The same holds true for getting involved in passive income streams, network marketing or any kind of commission-based earnings. There’s some airy-fairy thinking going on courtesy of the two profits planets, Venus and Jupiter, not being grounded today. Don’t go with your gut; operate with logic.

"
19 may 2017,pisces,"A big boost in earnings could come your way thanks to a rare Uranus-Saturn trine, an event that will repeat in November. Uranus is the genius planet, the orb of spontaneity, so you could experience a “Eureka!” moment in which you stumble upon a hot new income stream or job opening. There’s a saying: “do things the same way you’ve always done them and you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.” It’s time to think out of the box.

"
20 may 2017,pisces,"Feeling like nesting at home? Ready to redecorate, relax and work in the garden? That could be the case now that the Sun is in your domestic fourth house. Family issues can get cleared up over the next four weeks. A pregnancy might occur, couples could move in together and engagements are quite possible! But don’t get too pushy about making all of this happen, a possibility with assertive Mars in the same part of the sky. Fortunately chatty Mercury is in your house of communication, making it far easier to talk things over intelligently and come to a drama-free agreement.

"
21 may 2017,pisces,"Now that the Sun is in your domestic sector you should be focused on having a clean, organized and relaxing place to come home to at the end of each day. And if that means setting certain people straight about their responsibilities, like getting the chores done, so be it. They also need to know that you want to live in a drama-free environment, so they’ll need to change their attitude along with their habits.

"
22 may 2017,pisces,"You want guarantees and you want them now, and today is a good day to demand them. Nicely, that is. Venus is in your house of security, and as she sidles up to the Moon your emotions could rise. Whether you’re looking for an answer in love, money or a family matter, don’t get carried away with drama and ultimatums. You can get the answers you’re looking for with honey on your tongue rather than vinegar.

"
23 may 2017,pisces,"Who’s the boss in your private life? If your kids are running you into the ground, a spouse is on a power trip or family members are butting in too much, you’ll be ready to mutiny by the 29th. That’s when stern Saturn opposes Mars in the heavens, one heck of a tough aspect. A word to the wise Pisces: lay down the law now before then, or things will get ugly.

"
24 may 2017,pisces,"You certainly can enjoy some good times ahead with friends or business colleagues. But you have to make sure that everyone knows their roles within a team effort, not to mention due dates, scheduling and so on. If there are any malcontents within your circle it may be time to let them go. Tomorrow’s new moon in Gemini is all about you feeling comfortable, and that includes your relationships with others.

"
25 may 2017,pisces,"There are only 24 hours in a day, something that you would be wise to remember, Pisces! And that means that you can’t do it all. Today’s new moon recommends spending more quality time at home with your family, a lover or simply yourself. If that means cutting back on your work day so be it. Maybe some big goals need to be scaled back or given a different completion date, one that’s further out in the future. Getting in touch with the more sentimental part of your life is what it’s all about right now.

"
26 may 2017,pisces,"It’s always a good thing when charismatic Venus is in your house of self esteem and dignity, and that’s the situation you’re in over the next few weeks. If working out and becoming more fit will make you feel better about yourself, then this is a good time to start a diet and exercise plan. It’s not your destiny to live with an achey, flabby body!

"
27 may 2017,pisces,"A sudden burst of inspiration might hit you to get your home environment pulled together. And the good thing about getting one area of your life cleaned up is that it often leads to momentum in other areas. Get things rolling this weekend and get ready to savor the results.

"
28 may 2017,pisces,"What did Dorothy learn in The Wizard of Oz?  Plenty, but one of the biggest messages was that you don’t have to travel far to learn about life. Sometimes the greatest lessons are those that take place right in your back yard, and that’s what the cosmos is telling you, Pisces.

"
29 may 2017,pisces,"Take a deep breath and count to ten! A Saturn-Mars faceoff could bring out the worst in family members and  work colleagues over the next few days. People will be wearing their bossy pants and you will be in no mood for it, especially if you feel that your security is threatened in any way. The good news is that you’re like the little piggy with the brick house, telling the big bad wolf that he can huff and puff all he wants….but you won’t be backing down. Let ’em turn tail and run away.

"
30 may 2017,pisces,"Getting a handle on household expenses becomes easier with a helpful Mars-Uranus aspect. You may end up making a quick decision to cut out some expenses that are simply not necessary. Likewise, an idea for a new income stream could pop into your head. Tomorrow’s a great day to run some of these ideas past others who can give you feedback.

"
31 may 2017,pisces,"You may be in the spotlight over the next few days, so make sure that you’re polished and have your act together. That won’t be too hard with so many planets making you look like a winner. If you need the advice of someone older or wiser, reach out and make that contact.

"
1 june 2017,pisces,"Need to make a big ask? Then go for it! Charismatic Venus will put the right words in your mouth. Decision makers may actually be more amenable to your requests than you’d might expect, so don’t hold back. Mature Saturn is by your side, helping you make new arrangements that will stand the test of time.

"
1 june 2016,pisces,"Who’s pulling the strings at home? That question may be on your mind as the Sun squares Neptune, creating confusion and perhaps even drama. You may be drawing a line in the sand with a family member, whether it’s a spouse, parent, in-law or child. If you feel that others have been taking you for granted, chances are you’re going to be vocal about it.

"
2 june 2017,pisces,"You’re entering into a brave new phase in which you won’t be hesitant to speak your mind. This isn’t just about sharing your opinions: it’s about showing the world the passion that’s driving you forward. Once Mars rolls into Cancer on Sunday, you’ll be be unstoppable as your skill level increases daily.

"
2 june 2016,pisces,"Reach out and touch someone! It’s a wonderful day to express your thoughts and emotions to someone you care about, whether it’s a child, family member or loved one. This is especially true if you’ve been harboring resentment, guilt or anger. The North Node of the Moon is active, which means that old feelings of worthlessness simply don’t belong in your psyche any more. You deserve to be happy, Pisces, we all do. But sometimes to you have to ask for it.

"
3 june 2017,pisces,"“I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more!” is a famous line from the 1976 movie Network, and it really applies to you today Pisces. Not the mad part though. The part about not wanting to settle for life’s table scraps. You’re worth more and you know it, and a rockin’ conjunction between Venus and Uranus will drive that point home.

"
4 june 2017,pisces,"Your relationships with loved ones becomes the focus over the next two months as Mars glides into your house of romance and children today. Schedule date nights with your spouse. Clear out time on your calendar just for your kids or grandkids. This also happens to be the sector of enjoying life, creativity and sports, so you  need the time to indulge in hobbies and interests that stir your soul.

"
5 june 2017,pisces,"Touchy! That’s how you may feel today as the Sun squares Neptune. Your emotions will be operating at full throttle, not a good situation if you have any major decisions to make. Wait until Friday’s full moon in Sagittarius before you make up your mind. This lunation occurs in your rational house of authority, so you’ll be in a much better place.

"
6 june 2017,pisces,"This is not time to hide your light under a bushel. Venus enters your communication sector today, recommending that you promote yourself! The good thing, however, is that you won’t have to push too hard thanks to Venus’s easy going nature. With Friday’s full moon falling in your house of achievement and success, start turning the spotlight on you now.

"
7 june 2017,pisces,"Family matters may have been getting under your skin as of late, and that includes love relationships. Fortunately smooth talking and logical Mercury moves into your domestic sector today, a blessing for holding calm discussions with loved ones. You may need to set some boundaries, or take control of situations that have been dragging on, even if you don’t feel like it. But that’s better than stewing in resentment.

"
8 june 2017,pisces,"Trying to put aside more cash in investments and build a more comfortable nest egg? A helpful Jupiter-Neptune aspect provides the inspiration you need to get moving. Fortunately for you, tomorrow’s full moon falls in your house of ambition— the planets are lining up nicely. Your skills may be far worth than you’re settling for, which means that you shouldn’t sell yourself short. If you want to earn more you may need to learn more, so keep that in mind.

"
9 june 2017,pisces,"Ready for more responsibility? The planets seem to think so! The full moon takes place in your career sector, which also governs other big goals of yours. You could be making a big decision over the next few weeks, something with long lasting implications. But with unpredictable Uranus in a good angle, something positive could come your way that you may not be expecting.

"
10 june 2017,pisces,"At long last love? Abundant Jupiter finally resumes direct motion in the most passionate part of your chart. If you’ve been unsure as to which direction to head in, clarity will return. Over the next few months you’re going to start to feel as though you have more control over your life, a positive feeling. Waiting for other people to make up their minds won’t be a part of your repertoire.

"
11 june 2017,pisces,"Why are you letting others define who you are? If this continues your self-esteem will take a hit. Start living by your own rules, Pisces. When Neptune retrogrades this Friday you’ll have plenty of time for self analysis and making changes. You deserve dignity.

"
12 june 2017,pisces,"Cut through any dramas that have been going on around you. With insightful Mercury in a good angle, you can get people back on track, behaving politely instead of being at war. You may need to lay down the law but so be it. Your peace of mind is worth it.

"
13 june 2017,pisces,"No one knows how to push your buttons like family, as they say, and today that adage is true. You’re feeling a bit thin skinned these days, Pisces, and actually just about anyone could be working your nerves. Pull away for an hour or two and do some thinking. Is the reason you feel so tense due to all of the obligations you have? If so, it’s time to make some changes.

"
14 june 2017,pisces,"Get quiet today and dig into your work or the projects that are important to you. Sometimes we just need to shut the world out for a few hours in order for true inspiration to hit us, and that’s the message in the stars for you today. Your family or other loved ones may be tugging at your sleeve, but patiently let them know that you need some space.

"
15 june 2017,pisces,"Duty calls, but you’re not too interested in responding. A harsh Sun-Saturn aspect pits your personal need for downtime against a demanding boss, client, or tasks that are clamoring for attention. Is it burnout? Too many long hours spent at the office or on other responsibilities? This energy repeats again on Sunday, so set some boundaries if need be.

"
16 june 2017,pisces,"Neptune, your ruler, begins its usual retrograde in Pisces from now through late November. As a result you may become more reflective, especially about important plans or dreams for the future. But what’s wrong with that? Sometimes we need a quiet time for adjustments to be made. Just make sure that you don’t start questioning your talent or personality. You have what it takes, so be proud!


"
17 june 2017,pisces,"The cosmos is sending mixed messages, Pisces! On the one hand, Neptune in retrograde is telling you to go within and be reflective. But the friendly Sun and chatty Mercury are getting ready to enter your fifth house of fun, frolic and flirting. What to do? Hmmmm….book some alone time while you’re planning the next escapade, perhaps!

"
18 june 2017,pisces,"Making changes on the home front could happen more quickly than you realize, Pisces. You may need to put people on notice that you have certain expectations, or set boundaries to keep people from annoying the living daylights out of you. But so be it. Your peace of mind is worth it.

"
19 june 2017,pisces,"Are your heart and your head working at cross purposes, Pisces? It sure seems that way from your chart. It’s emotions versus logic as Mercury and Saturn stare each other down across the heavens. Fortunately this cosmic storm passes quickly and by midweek the atmosphere has changed. (Just so you know….it looks like the heart wins!)

"
20 june 2017,pisces,"Creating more structure in your home environment becomes easier with a productive Mercury-Uranus aspect. There’s something to be said for a smooth-running household, even if you live by yourself. Take care of as many things as you can today, or create some new routines that you’ll initiate soon. Tomorrow the Sun enters the most fun-loving part of your chart, and honestly you may not be too motivated!

"
21 june 2017,pisces,"Lucky you! The Sun and convivial Mercury enter your fifth house of fun and flirting, to be followed by a new moon in this sector on the weekend. It’s time to stop and smell the flowers—and the lattes, prosecco and veal marsala. It’s time to take in a movie with a big tub of buttered popcorn, not to mention heading to the beach and soaking up the rays. While you’re at it, schedule brunches with the girls and special date nights with your sweetie. Single? This is one of your best times all year to meet someone new.

"
22 june 2017,pisces,"The ancients considered everything when they created the 12 house system in astrology, including our hobbies, the sports we play and the kind of entertainment venues we enjoy. These fall under the fifth house, which for you is now lit up like a Christmas tree. So pick up your paint brushes, golf clubs or go to a museum. Life’s too short to be working all the time.


"
23 june 2017,pisces,"The stereotype of the airhead artist is just that–a stereotype. So is the one about the corporate people who are all facts and figures. The reality is that we all have a creative side and a more structured one. Your job today is to align the two.

"
24 june 2017,pisces,"The people in your world are about to become a lot more important to you, thanks to the new moon in one of the most social and fun-loving parts of your chart. Networking is the order of the day, whether you do so to find new love, a job, or just to create new bonds with like-minded people. It’s also a great time to become more civic minded and get involved in your local happenings.

"
25 june 2017,pisces,"Feel like taking a risk in love? Or maybe you’re simply ready to live a more authentic life. That’s because your ruler, Neptune, is active in your chart, encouraging you to live a far more colorful existence. The question is this–do you have the guts to pursue it?

"
26 june 2017,pisces,"It’s time to take a chance, Pisces–on yourself! A magnificent Mars-Neptune trine tells you to stop putting yourself down and instead, to focus on latent talents that may be buried within you. Why the hell are you holding back? Please! By the way, this energy isn’t going away anytime soon, so step out of the shadows and into the limelight.

"
27 june 2017,pisces,"Your head and your heart will work together today in perfect sync, so have faith that you’re heading in the right direction. Don’t let your own fears or the opinions of others to get in your way. This might happen over the next week, but brush it aside and keep moving forward.

"
27 june 2016,pisces,"The planets are lining up in your romance houses, smoothing the way ahead for a serious commitment. Neptune will help you see the big picture in romance as you release petty concerns; communicative Mercury enters your house of love, enabling you to speak with ease, and Mars finally goes direct in your blue-skies-ahead house of expansion. Single? The cosmos hasn’t forgotten you. Mars suggests that you think outside the box when it comes to new love.

"
28 june 2017,pisces,"Let your freak flag fly, Pisces! There’s no holding back as a Mars-Mercury aspect encourages you to be as bold and dramatic as you please. Dye your hair red, learn to speak French, toss out those old grandma underpants and buy some sexy lingerie, or basically dare to be different. The world is your oyster, so seize the moment.

"
28 june 2016,pisces,"Something may happen today that will find you questioning the practicality of a major goal or plan. It’s possible that you may have to scale back your plans a bit, primarily due to financial reasons. It’s also crucial to examine the protocols, routines or flow of events that need to take place in order for this plan to work. Do that, and you stand an excellent chance of success.

"
29 june 2017,pisces,"Despite your best efforts to play nice with others, they may not be willing to play nice back. Or maybe they’re moody, withdrawn or uncooperative. This is more about them than you, so let it slide. You have so much planetary activity in your frisky house of having fun that all you should be worrying about is your next adventure.

"
29 june 2016,pisces,"That proverbial light bulb will be going off above your head today, Pisces, as the cosmos illuminates your mind with a bright idea. It may seem to come out of nowhere, but that’s not the case. The planets are conspiring to bring you more security, both emotional and financial. Today’s “Eureka!” moment triggers activity in your eleventh house, the place of your deepest hopes and wishes. Don’t pooh-pooh what may be a super idea.

"
30 june 2017,pisces,"Kids, friends, family, your lover–they may all be in a wonky mood thanks to a Mars-Pluto smackdown that’s coming our way. Heck, they can even be stubborn and hot-headed, but you’re in a good spot. Healing Jupiter is chilling out your emotions and thoughts, so just roll with it.

"
30 june 2016,pisces,"Feel like the Love Boat is sailing without you? Venus is happily ensconced in your house of romance, setting your mind alight with thoughts of long-lasting love. But Pluto is on the opposite side of the heavens, slamming on the brakes. There may be a good reason for this, however–Pluto points out the shadow side of people and situations. Make sure that you’re not over-romanticizing a partner or a relationship; see it clearly for what it is.

"
1 july 2017,pisces,"Your ability to speak your mind increases dramatically as a constructive Moon-Neptune aspect opens up the lines of communication. This vibe continues all week, and it includes family members, friends and romantic partners. Whether they’ll respond favorably or not is another issue, but at least you’ll be at peace!

"
1 july 2016,pisces,"Yum! What a day for romance, Pisces. Planet of love Venus winks at lucky Jupiter in the house of long-term commitment. Are those wedding bells I’m hearing? The sound of you giving your phone number to a new hottie–who could become your spouse? No matter what your status–happily involved, disgruntled or looking–you stand a good chance of experiencing a turnaround in matters of the heart.

"
2 july 2017,pisces,"The grass may appear greener on the other side, Pisces, but is it really? A difficult Mars-Pluto smackdown could be stirring up the “green” in you or people around you, and I’m referring to jealousy. Don’t go down this path, as the upcoming full moon on the 8th is all about your  deepest desires.

"
2 july 2016,pisces,"If you don’t love what you do for a living, you need to ask yourself why. Sure, not every day at work is going to be a fun-filled extravaganza. But if you have more crummy days than good ones, you should be reconsidering how to bring more joy into your work. You may not need a new job; a change in attitude may do the trick.

"
3 july 2017,pisces,"A fun day awaits as planets in some of the most playful houses are active. Maybe you’ll decide to take the kids to the beach or the science museum. Perhaps a romantic dinner alone with your amour will do the trick. If you’re single (or in need of some “me” time), plot some kind of adventure, an activity that you’ve never tried before. Seize the day!

"
3 july 2016,pisces,"Tomorrow’s new moon occurs in your house of romance, but you get a head start today with a fabulous trine between the Sun and Neptune. The watery planet is dousing you with charisma and the desire to experience only the best in love. The new moon will open up a six-month period in which you can open your heart and receive the kind of love you deserve.

"
4 july 2017,pisces,"Your home environment will be the focus through the 31st as glam Venus, planet of comfort, eases her way into your domestic sector. Not only is this a smart time to beautify your house and garden, it’s also stellar for working out issues with the family unit. But you’ll be in a practical and budget conscious mood when Mercury enters Leo on Wednesday.

"
4 july 2016,pisces,"Lights, camera, action! The new moon shines its light on your talent, image and ambitions. You’re in an extraordinarily inspirational time, as illuminating Neptune is quite active. And with disciplined Saturn backing you up in the career zone, you can take your ideas and run with them.

5 july 2017,pisces,"Trying to get your groove back? Searching for more fun and less stress in your life? Then you’ll enjoy today’s Sun-Neptune trine, a perfect aspect for getting in touch with your more frivolous, light-hearted side. But you won’t get there if you’re too busy focusing on all the things that you perceive are going wrong. Let them be for a day.

"
5 july 2016,pisces,"Time for a makeover! A glamorous trine between Neptune and Mercury tells you to take a look in the mirror and figure out what can be dolled up a bit. Yesterday’s new moon fell in your romance sector, opening up a new chapter. You can look good for yourself, of course…but there’s nothing wrong with looking hot for the masses!

"
6 july 2017,pisces,"It’s time to stop being your own worst enemy, Pisces. The emotional junk in your mind needs to go so that you can start enjoying life more. Besides, with a full moon coming this weekend in your house of camaraderie, you don’t have time to waste on your woes. Interesting people are out there doing interesting things, and they want you to joint them.

"
6 july 2016,pisces,"Lucky you! The two lovers of our solar system, Mars and Venus, are forming the most glorious angle possible in the heavens. What’s more is that they’re telling you to take chances in love. Nothing stupid, mind you, like dating bad boys or divas, or taking on lovers with more issues than the people on Dr. Phil. Nope, this is about bringing more pizazz into your looks, your life, your attitude and the kind of love you want to enjoy.

"
7 july 2017,pisces,"Venus in your comfort-driven fourth house may be encouraging you to plop down on the sofa with a good book or Netflix, but tomorrow’s full moon falls in the house of your most cherished dreams and wishes! What’s a Pisces to do? Use that sofa time for daydreaming about things that could become a reality. Write them down while you’re at it.

"
7 july 2016,pisces,"Friend or frenemy? You’ll be questioning the allegiance of some of the people around you as shadowy Pluto acts up in your house of groups and acquaintances. Perhaps a pal doesn’t approve of your lifestyle or choice of lover. Maybe there’s some jealousy at play. A romantic partner may want more commitment right now than you’re willing to give. But things improve on Saturday, so don’t get blue over what is a temporary hiccup.

"
8 july 2017,pisces,"Despite some recent wonky cosmic energy surrounding friends and colleagues, tonight’s full moon could bring you together with people for some kind of victory. Perhaps your team at work will be finishing a major project, or a charity you’re involved with scores a big donation. Maybe it’s simply a matter of hanging out with your friends and making plans for a party or group vacation. With your ruler Neptune in a good spot, you can end up being the glue that holds the group together.

"
8 july 2016,pisces,"Need to have a talk with a loved one? Your aspects for having a constructive conversation are excellent. Mercury will help put the right words in your mouth and Jupiter aims to bring you closer together. This energy continues over the weekend, a great time to resolve issues that need to be put to rest.

"
9 july 2017,pisces,"Some people just seem to love drama, no matter how unpleasant it may be, but you don’t have to be a part of their theatrics. Avoid those who seem hell bent on making life more complicated than it needs to be.

"
9 july 2016,pisces,"Your closest ties can take a quantum leap forward, as planetary influences are determined to bring you only the best in relationships. Today’s action will cement an existing alliance or perhaps bring in a new one that will be around for quite some time!

"
10 july 2017,pisces,"You may want to head to the nearest cave and hide, as people around you could be acting out in a dramatic fashion. This energy will reoccur on the 17th and 20th, so if you don’t experience it today you could over the next two weeks. The question is: do you want to engage in someone else’s theatrical meltdowns? If not, keep your distance.

"
10 july 2016,pisces,"Looking for love? If so, today’s a winner, and you should take advantage of the beneficial energy the cosmos is delivering. The key is to keep an open mind and consider someone who’s not your usual type. Attached Pisces are advised to be more philosophical about their relationship in order to make it work. This may mean reframing your ideas or taking on a new point of view, but the results will be worth it.

"
11 july 2017,pisces,"If you need to take some quiet time alone to sort out your emotions and thoughts, then today is a good time to do so. There has been too much tension and drama coming from other people around you; recharge your batteries and do a little pampering.

"
11 july 2016,pisces,"Tired of being the household maid? If you’re the one performing all the grunt work while your kids and SO track in dirt, don’t do the dishes and lounge in front of the TV, things may reach critical mass. Lay down the law by implementing new routines and chores–and screw giving out allowances. With Venus and Mercury just about ready to enter your house of efficiency, you’re going to want your home to be a smooth-running machine.

"
12 july 2017,pisces,"People around you may have been acting out lately, but fortunately the emotional Moon enters your sign today, calming the waters of your mind. You don’t need to run and hide from others; just be yourself. Live in the eye of the hurricane and nothing will be able to ruffle your feathers.

"
12 july 2016,pisces,"Attention all Pisces who fell off the fitness wagon around January 15th! The cosmos is giving you another chance to go for your personal best. Sexy Venus enters your sixth house of wellness and physique, ushering in a new period in which you can make amazing headway. Chances are with Venus active, your interest in getting in shape is more about vanity than following doctor’s orders, but who cares. Mercury joins her tomorrow and the Sun follows on the 22nd. With these three urging you to shape up, you could be looking smokin’ hot in no time.

"
13 july 2017,pisces,"Your self esteem rises as Neptune, your ruler, meets up with the passionate Moon. And why not? You’re worthy of happiness. If you need to step away, though, from the dramas that other people are creating in order to feel better about yourself, then do so.

"
13 july 2016,pisces,"Mental fog, begone. Quick-thinking, nimble Mercury is now in your efficiency zone, urging you to clear off the top of your desk, empty out your e-mail account and create new protocols. They say that an organized desk is the sign of an organized mind, and there’s something to that. Going the feng shui route at home and the office will lead to peace of min.

"
14 july 2017,pisces,"Simplify, simplify. This is the perfect day to get down to basics in all areas of your life: health, fitness, your home environment and work flow at the office, just to name a few. Why make things so complicated? The upside is that as simplification grows, so does your serenity.

"
14 july 2016,pisces,"Attitude adjustment! People make the world go round, as the saying goes, and different folks have quite contrasting and diverse view points. Today you may meet up with someone whose ideas are fundamentally different than your own, but this shouldn’t be a problem. On the contrary–it should help you expand your own awareness, even if it challenges you.

"
15 july 2017,pisces,"Go ahead, flirt your little heart out! With the Moon in your sign winking at Mars in your house of frisky fun and romance, this is no time to be a wallflower. By the way, this also happens to be the sector that governs the luxe life–so is a shopping spree in order? I think so!

"
15 july 2016,pisces,"No more indecision, waffling or feeling wimpy! A strong Saturn-Moon meetup in the heavens is designed to put you in control of your life. Not just for today, not just for the week, but for perpetuity. This isn’t about being bossy or bitchy, but rather about you being the captain of your own ship. You can’t control the winds, but you can trim the sails.

"
16 july 2017,pisces,"You might come to a quick decision about a money or career matter, a change that needs to be made. Perhaps it’s to switch jobs or even fields. Maybe it’s to severely curtail your spending. Whatever it is, others may not support you 100%. Change makes them uneasy. But having more money in the bank is essential right now, so go for it.

"
16 july 2016,pisces,"Your idea of excitement and fun may be quite different than your lover’s, Pisces! A Sun-Uranus square indicates that your SO may be stuck in a rut, whereas you’re ready to experiment. So if you’re getting tired of watching TV on Saturday nights and eating pizza, or your boudoir activity is a real snooze, you’re going to be fired up to toss out boring old routines. Singles: stop looking for a new partner in the usual haunts. Planetary influences tell you to switch things up.

"
17 july 2017,pisces,"Just how much drama and intrigue do you want in love–and how much contentment and security? Today’s a time when you can’t have both, so choose wisely. Chances are you’ll opt for more structure and stability once the Sun enters Leo on Thursday.

"
17 july 2016,pisces,"There’s a full on Tuesday in the house that governs your most cherished dreams and wishes, a wonderful aspect for closing out things that aren’t working for you and going after your passions. But in order to move forward, an internal inventory is required. Assertive Mars forms a helpful trine today with Chiron, the wounded healer. What do you need to release or heal in order to progress? Slow down, and get in touch with the deepest part of your psyche.

"
18 july 2017,pisces,"Optimism increases and fears of failure start to dissipate with a happy Venus-Jupiter trine. Sometimes the only thing holding us back from true happiness is ourselves, something that may become clear today. Get ready to take that important next step!

"
18 july 2016,pisces,"You’re changing as a person, Pisces, and things that may have seemed so important to you in the past may not have the same allure. A secret meeting between Pluto and the Moon in the house that governs your deepest wishes is taking place. What do you really  want out of life? Not what your parents desire, or your lover, or the social circle you inhabit. Tomorrow’s full moon will help you fine tune your dreams. Start dreaming today.

"
19 july 2017,pisces,"It’s time to examine your habits and routines and come up with better ones that will stand the test of time. Flying by the seat of your pants is no longer an option, and if it takes you a few weeks (or longer!) to create smarter systems, so be it.

"
19 july 2016,pisces,"Your best bet these days for achieving your ambitions is to join a group or work with a team. Today’s full moon in the networking part of your chart suggests that some kind of team effort will soon be coming to fruition, quite successfully at that. Whether you want to lose weight, meet a new hottie or get ahead in your career, consider what associations, clubs or industry events will get you there the fastest.

"
20 july 2017,pisces,"Look out! People of the Pisces persuasion are going to be on a roll, so get out of their way. That’s because energetic Mars barrels into their house of organization and productivity today, a place it hasn’t been in two years. Martha Stewart is their new patron saint.

"
20 july 2016,pisces,"Your ability to impress the boss, a prospective employer or a client is off the charts today, thanks to a sweet Venus-Saturn trine. Saturn has been pushing you into taking more command of your career, telling you to think longer term and show the world what you’ve got. It falls into place with Venus by your side. Go after the gig, the assignment, the promotion, the deal.

"
21 july 2017,pisces,"Something unexpected could happen today that may throw you off your game a bit, and the worst thing you can do is to get emotional about it. Logical thinking needs to win out, so step away from an obstacle or drama and consider it through a rational, objective lens.

"
21 july 2016,pisces,"Let your intuition be your guide. The Moon in Aquarius heightens your sixth sense, helping you see the truth behind facades. A positive Jupiter connection assists you in understanding a romantic relationship with deeper insight.

"
22 july 2017,pisces,"More powerful than a steaming locomotive! No, it’s not Superman–it’s Pisces. The Sun has just joined Mars in your house of productivity, turning you into a whirling dervish of efficient activity. Between now and August 21st you can create new habits and systems that will not only clear up the clutter, but bring serenity as well.

"
22 july 2016,pisces,"No one is going to be able to stop a Pisces from getting the job done, thanks to the Sun entering the most efficient part of your chart! At home or the office, you’ll be a force to be reckoned with over the next four weeks. Try to line up job interviews or salary talks before Saturday, when unpredictable Uranus goes retro in your income sector.

"
23 july 2017,pisces,"Start paying closer attention to your budget, Pisces. The new moon in Leo today is a godsend in that it can help you pull your life together both at home and in your business, but the planets suggest focusing on your finances first. Do this and everything else will fall into place.

"
23 july 2016,pisces,"It’s all about me! The Moon enters Pisces for the weekend, making it all about you indeed–but not in a selfish way. Inspirational Neptune is in fine form, encouraging you to glam up your looks, your home and your lifestyle. If you feel that life has become dull, then get off your duff and get going with an overhaul. Now that the Sun is in Leo, getting fit and toned should be at the top of your list.

"
24 july 2017,pisces,"You have your own life to live, so don’t let someone guilt you into thinking that you owe them a lot of your time and sympathy. If you don’t set some boundaries now you’ll end up a frazzled mess. Time for some new rules!

"
24 july 2016,pisces,"The next few weeks could bring quite a few positive changes at the office. Planets in Leo are trying to get you in a happier place, with better assignments, clients, colleagues and working conditions. Today a strong Moon-Sun connection finds you ruminating about the money you earn, and you might become quite motivated to go after more. Try to plant as many seeds as possible before Friday.

"
25 july 2017,pisces,"Partnering up with people who share your ideas and values becomes easier over the next few weeks. With so much planetary activity in your ultra-efficient sixth house you may be thinking that if you want something done you’ve got to do it yourself, but that isn’t the best MO.

"
25 july 2016,pisces,"A team venture may go off the rails today as issues over budgets and responsibilities arise. Whether it’s your wedding or a tech startup, you need to get clear on who’s supposed to be doing what and how much it’s all going to cost. Do so before Uranus goes retrograde in this part of your chart on Friday.

"
26 july 2017,pisces,"This is absolutely one of the best days in 2017 to make a commitment to better health and fitness. Energetic Mars meets up with the Sun, the orb that governs vitality and personal power. Just don’t try to run a marathon this weekend if you can’t run around the block, as Mars might make you too  motivated.

"
26 july 2016,pisces,"Give a “voice” to your dreams by taking some time to write them down. Grab a pad of paper and a pen and spell out just what you’d like to see happen in your life over the next year or so. The full moon on the 19th encouraged you to set your sights higher. Why not create a vision board or notebook that will make your ideas come alive?

"
27 july 2017,pisces,"According to your chart your finances could use a boost, and the next three days are a good time to examine them. Do you have enough tucked away for a rainy day? With so much planetary activity in your uber-efficient sixth house, start creating a practical savings plan.

"
27 july 2016,pisces,"With three planets in Leo, all pushing you to get things done, clear off your desk and empty out your email account (not to mention getting organized at home), you may feel like you don’t have time to chat. But take the time to do so, especially with co-workers or people in your industry today. Your friendliness may open up doors down the line that you may not expect.

"
28 july 2017,pisces,"Today is perfect for following your heart’s desire, so don’t get strong armed into doing something that you don’t feel like, even if it’s just going to a movie or a particular cafe. In the days ahead you need to take care of #1 a little bit more, but that doesn’t mean that you’ll be alone!

"
28 july 2016,pisces,"While Mars is pushing you into thinking big and only wanting to take meetings with movers and shakers, you might want to consider what the “little people” have to say. In your rush to make headway you might miss some key points and ideas that are floating around out there. Be present enough to pay attention to them.

"
29 july 2017,pisces,"Something might happen today that could make you think that the security of a particular situation is threatened, but this is a temporary cosmic blip. Unpredictable Uranus is acting up like a crotchety old man who’s complaining about minutiae. By tomorrow he’s back on track with a smile on his face, so chill.

"
29 july 2016,pisces,"Famed sports psychologist Jim Loehr has said that if you show him an athlete’s weekly schedule, he can tell if they’re going to go pro or not. In other words, the routine makes the man or the woman. Now that Uranus is retro in your house of routines, it’s time to analyze yours for weaknesses and strong points. And since time is money, the more efficient you become, the more you can earn–and save. The next five months can add a lot to your bottom line if you’re willing to put in the discipline.

"
30 july 2017,pisces,"Sometimes we create “rules” or routines for ourselves that just aren’t as helpful as we may think, and today is a good time to toss them. Create some new rules that demand more enjoyment while you’re at it, because charismatic Venus enters your house of romance and fun tomorrow.

"
30 july 2016,pisces,"Start thinking about how teaming up with a collaborator could improve your career or home life, Pisces. Now that talkative Mercury is in the partnership sector it’s a good time to reach out to others who share the same goals and have the same needs. For example, you could agree to watch another woman’s kids while she goes grocery shopping, and she does the same for you. Exercise buddies, writing partners, think tank members–the power of the group can exceed the power of one right now.

"
31 july 2017,pisces,"Been lookin’ for love in all the wrong places? Or maybe you’ve been waiting to spend some quality time with your amour, but things have gotten in the way. Good news–romantic Venus is now in your romance sector, smoothing the path ahead.

"
31 july 2016,pisces,"Balance is needed when it comes to sharing your precious free hours with loved ones, and that may become apparent this weekend. Too much time spent with one group versus another may get someone bent out of shape. If you’re neglecting your lover to hang out with the guys, or your kids aren’t getting any face time, chances are you’ll hear about it.

"
1 august 2017,pisces,"Sometimes ya just gotta strut your stuff and let people know what you’re all about. Do it politely, of course, without bragging. With look-at-me Venus in your house of talent and charisma, people will  notice.

"
1 august 2016,pisces,"You’ve been working hard, Pisces, but you may be questioning why you’re hustling so much to keep other people happy. The planets are trying to push you into more of a leadership role, whether you’re employed by others or want to go the entrepreneurial route. Over the next few weeks you’ll be giving more thought to what you’re capable of, and how to go about achieving it.

"
2 august 2017,pisces,"It’s a smart day to plan your next career coup as mature, long range Saturn is in a solid position. You may want to consider a side hustle or developing a stronger income base while you’re at it, as Uranus retrogrades tomorrow in your earnings sector.

"
3 august 2017,pisces,"Keep a close eye on your expenses, savings and income streams as erratic Uranus goes retrograde in the sector that governs them. This situation will take you all the way into the first week of January, so the best advice is to be thrifty and conservative. If you need to do a side hustle, know that Uranus deals with brilliant ideas, so you could hit upon a few genius methods for earning more.

"
3 august 2016,pisces,"Yesterday’s new moon kicked off an intense period ahead in which you’ll be cutting through red tape, dismantling idiotic protocols and shattering glass ceilings. But in order to do so, you’ll need a reliable and logical routine and some effective new habits. Innovative Mars sparks your brain with some smart, productive habits. Implement them right away.

"
4 august 2017,pisces,"The company you keep needs to be true blue, Pisces. A Jupiter-Pluto square could bring out the truth about a person who may not have your best interests at heart. Or they may be jealous, resentful that you’re leading what they perceive to be the good life. A little space may be necessary for awhile until they get their priorities straight.

"
4 august 2016,pisces,"Clearing up confusion is necessary if you want to move on in a relationship, and you need to start with yourself! Neptune in Pisces is acting up this week, causing you to question alliances with others, both in business and romance. The problem is that the folks around you may be coming on rather strong, and you’re wondering whether you need to push back or not. The answer is yes. Set boundaries, define limits.

"
5 august 2017,pisces,"It’s shape-up time! A sparkling Sun-Neptune aspect tells you to work that body, and it you’re already involved with a particular diet and exercise regimen, to switch it up a little. Major advances in other health issues can take place thanks to Monday’s lunar eclipse, so get ready for some healing to begin.

"
5 august 2016,pisces,"Sweet! Love planet Venus graciously slips into your house of committed relationships today. While singles may get off the fence and look for love, and attached Aquarians will want more amour, planetary influences indicate that there’s a new Pisces in town. You’re done  with putting up with nonsense, games and partners who can’t commit. It’s time to create unwavering standards as to what you’ll accept in a romance.

"
6 august 2017,pisces,"Someone close may say or do something that rattles your cage, and as a result you may end up questioning the relationship. It could be that they’re just having an off day, so don’t read too much into it. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in the most intuitive part of your chart should shed some light on all of your key connections.

"
6 august 2016,pisces,"Venus may now be in your commitment sector, stirring up thoughts of passionate romance, but this weekend’s aspects are all about Reality (with a capital R). Let’s face it, relationships have a certain dynamic. People can become bossy, play the martyr, act as enablers and all the many other roles that exist in love. What’s going on in your romance? One thing’s for sure–if you’ve been treated like a doormat or are being taken for granted, that’s going to come to a crashing halt once Saturn turns direct on the 13th.

"
7 august 2017,pisces,"A highly cathartic lunar eclipse in the most healing part of your chart opens up a door to greater serenity and vitality, as both your physical and mental well-being are affected. This is a super time to put some new habits in place that will enable you to feel better, whether it’s meditation or working out. With motivator Mars in such a good angle you’ll be hell bent on seeing progress.

"
7 august 2016,pisces,"Neptune, your ruler, is making you question your deepest relationships. With love planet Venus now in your house of romance, things should  be getting steamier, but you may be having doubts. Your needs and desires are pitted against those of your partner. But this isn’t a deal breaker. You’ll have the chance to talk things over in a constructive manner on Wednesday, and when Saturn goes direct on Saturday  you’ll be stepping into your power.

"
8 august 2017,pisces,"If you feel like hiding away in your garret while you plan world domination, blame it on the recent eclipse in your hush-hush twelfth house. And if that includes starting your own business or climbing the ladder in your industry, you’re in luck. Brilliant Uranus is inspiring you to come up with some new ideas for success. Pay attention to your dreams as well as your daytime intuition.

"
8 august 2016,pisces,"It may be tempting to listen to the advice of others, but the planets warn that your own inner voice is the best guide right now. Even if the people around you have your best interests at heart you need to make your own decisions. Saturn is now retrograde in your house of authority, so it’s not surprising that you may be second-guessing yourself. But it goes direct this Saturday, leading to greater clarity.

"
9 august 2017,pisces,"Working as part of a team, group or family unit always presents challenges, but today they can be smoothed over. Chances are you’re the one who’s going to have to take charge, at least initially, but if you don’t things will become even more convoluted. Get the ball rolling then step aside.

"
9 august 2016,pisces,"The Moon in Scorpio is pushing you to think beyond “the usual” today–you know, the usual hairstyle, the same old vacation, the old familiar restaurant, the same career path. Venus also encourages you  to take a risk, even if it’s just a small change that will make you feel that you’re getting out of a rut. Life’s too short not to sample everything that’s on offer.

"
10 august 2017,pisces,"Your financial security is directly tied in with solid habits, so take a good look at your spending and savings habits to see if there’s an area that could stand some improvement. If a lover–or your kids–are running up bills, a smooth talking Mercury-Venus aspect will enable you to talk things over with them.

"
10 august 2016,pisces,"The Moon in Scorpio is advising you to schedule a play date, Pisces, and I’m not talking about your kids. Heck no, it’s time for you to book an adventure with some friends or a lover–or both! Your romance does  look like it could use a little “refreshing”, and the cosmos suggests that some private time with your amour could lead to discussions about future plans.

"
11 august 2017,pisces,"If you need to vent to someone close, today’s a good time to do so. With the Sun in your practical sixth house, you should be able to speak your piece without a lot of drama. Tomorrow Mercury retrogrades in your partnership sector, so get issues out on the table right now.

"
11 august 2016,pisces,"Support for an important idea of yours may come from a surprising place, a nice thing to happen. With Saturn getting ready to move forward in your ambitious tenth house on Saturday, you might already be getting the feeling that positive changes are on the horizon. When the Moon swings past assertive Mars and disciplined Saturn today, you’ll be charging up your batteries as you ready for the next chapter.

"
12 august 2017,pisces,"Touchy much? Mercury retrogrades in your moody twelfth house til the 31st, making you vulnerable to reading too much into things and feeling hurt. This is especially true in your closest relationships as murky Neptune creates confusion. But by the time of the solar eclipse on the 21st, clarity should start to return.

"
12 august 2016,pisces,"Someone needs to take charge of a situation, Pisces, and you’re looking like the person for the job–like it or not! It doesn’t matter if this has to do with a family issue, a romance, or something at work. It seems that roles have to be reassigned and new routines established. Someone in your circle might object, but things have to get done.

"
13 august 2017,pisces,"The next six months are awesome for gaining control of your life and feeling like everything is in its place. A powerful Sun-Saturn trine helps set things in motion. Good habits are the secret sauce, so examine yours and make sure that they’re up to par.

"
13 august 2016,pisces,"Flying solo or going the group route? Serious Saturn has been retrograde in your house of ambition for five months, forcing you to analyze your biggest plans . It was a necessary phase that allowed you to tweak things up and make them more coherent. In doing so, you may have questioned staying on the same path in love and career, or leaving those folks altogether for a new path: either traveling on your journey by yourself for awhile, or finding new partners. The choice is up to you.

"
14 august 2017,pisces,"Super day to speak your mind with a lover or kids, thanks to a helpful Moon-Venus connection. Venus’s gentle presence means that screaming and ultimatums won’t be necessary. Tell it like it is, with love and authority.

"
14 august 2016,pisces,"You are ruled by watery Neptune, and as such your emotions run deep. But today there may be some ruffled waves on the surface as Neptune opposes Venus in your partnership sector. What you need, want and value may be quite different than someone else. Your best bet is to talk things over with a trusted confidante, as the Moon is forming a helpful angle from your house of friends.

"
15 august 2017,pisces,"Not everyone around you shares your opinions, values and dreams, something that can become apparent with today’s Venus-Pluto opposition. The question is whether you want to fight with them about it or not. Sometimes the wisest choice is to step aside and let things work out organically, over time.

"
15 august 2016,pisces,"It seems lately that your friends are making a lot more sense than the other people in your world, so if you need to get something off your chest, reach out to a trusted pal. Their input could help you immensely. With Pluto and the Moon so active in your house of friendship, there are also people hovering in the periphery of your life whom could end up being mentors. Keep your mind open about expanding your social circle.

"
16 august 2017,pisces,"It’s time to get your emotions out of the way when it comes to dealing with family matters, which is no easy task! The cosmos is telling you to take a practical approach, rather than falling back on old ingrained family patterns and feelings. Sometimes you just have to see things for what they truly are.

"
16 august 2016,pisces,"Shake things up! Rebellious Uranus in your income sector is on a roll today, urging you to think in a completely different manner about how to make more money. It forms a magnificent angle with the Sun in your productivity sector. It seems that there’s a way to increase your earnings that is faster and more streamlined than what you’re doing now. Pay attention to your process.

"
17 august 2017,pisces,"Pisces, this is no  time for irresponsible flings, torrid affairs or stirring up unnecessary drama in an existing relationship. With luxury-loving Venus in your house of romance, you may feel like you have the freedom to take some risks—but the cosmos says otherwise.

"
17 august 2016,pisces,"Groovy, baby! Sexual and romantic chemistry are in the air, thanks to a yummy Venus-Pluto trine. And this isn’t about a Tinder hookup. No sirree, we’re talking the real deal: commitment. Singles could find a new love online or through a friend. Couples can find more satisfaction by taking up activities together or with a group. The couple that plays together stays together.

"
18 august 2017,pisces,"You definitely need to devote this weekend to spending time with a lover, your kids, or your own pursuits, such as a sport or hobby. A Moon-Venus connection urges you to have fun…especially considering that Monday’s solar eclipse will be all about getting grunt work done over the next six months!

"
18 august 2016,pisces,"It’s time to get real about a partnership, Pisces. Today’s full moon in the most confidential part of your chart will find you ruminating over the state of your union. With Jupiter opposing Chiron, you need to ask if you’re deluding yourself about a commitment, be it romantic or business. Rebellious Uranus is acting up from your security sector, demanding answers. But with optimistic Jupiter by your side, your future looks promising.

"
19 august 2016,pisces,"With the emotional Moon gliding past watery Neptune in your house of goals and self-image, you may be waffling about which direction to go in with a plan. And to make matters more complicated, someone close to you may be putting in their two cents worth. They may mean well but it won’t help bring about clarity! What will  help, however, is the union of Mars and Saturn next Wednesday in your house of authority.

"
20 august 2016,pisces,"Three planets in Virgo are working hard to fill up your social calendar and to find you a mate, if you’re in the market for one. The Sun is getting ready to join them on Monday, so get ready for a busy month ahead. However, you may feel like just chilling chez vous today. Peopled out? Maybe! That’s OK. Charge your batteries over the weekend and rejoin the human race on next week.

"
21 august 2016,pisces,"Don’t feel rushed into making a major decision that deals with your career or goals, Pisces. While it’s nice to have a handle on things and feel secure about the future, taking your time has its advantages. Your ability to make sound, rational decisions is growing; insecurities may rattle you a bit, but in the end logic and confidence will win.

"
22 august 2016,pisces,"People are going to start paying attention to you, Pisces. As the Sun rolls into Virgo, your house of relating to others, you may find that folks are interested in what you have to say and what you have to offer. Better yet is that assertive Mars and wise Saturn are developing your sense of authority and persuasiveness. It’s time to kiss insecurities goodbye.

"
23 august 2016,pisces,"The secretive Moon encourages you to spend some time alone today with your thoughts, especially when it comes to achieving a goal or ambition. Tomorrow Mars and Saturn meet up in your house of success, fame and kudos. It’s an amazing aspect that can take you far. But a little foresight behind closed doors will help you make key decisions.

"
24 august 2016,pisces,"A highly auspicious aspect in the heavens can take your ambitions to new heights, Pisces! Energetic Mars and disciplined Saturn meet in you house of fame, kudos and career. This is about as good as it gets, but watch the tendency to get pushy, thanks to assertive Mars by your side. It’s also possible that someone may try to corral you into making a decision, but if you need more time, take it. Partnerships are favored with a strong and profitable Moon-Jupiter trine. Take this energy and run with it!

"
25 august 2016,pisces,"Despite some really positive action taking place in your success and career zone, you seem a little frazzled. Insecurities from way back in the day (like childhood) could be rising to the surface. Old patterns die hard, and the dynamics found in families can follow you around for decades, even if people have crossed over. Give yourself permission to be content, successful and happy.

"
26 august 2016,pisces,"If someone comes on strong with you today it could make you lose your self-confidence rather quickly. But stop questioning yourself–and don’t give up your power to others. You have what it takes to win and be happy, but sometimes you just need to remind yourself that!

27 august 2016,pisces,"A romance can take an amazing turn as the two most beneficial planets in the sky, Venus and Jupiter, meet up in the heavens in a tight embrace. They will be less than 1 degree apart, something that won’t happen again for another 50 years. Singles are in a prime position to meet a new partner, and a serious one at that. Already committed? It’s an excellent day to make progress by talking things through. It’s an emotional day where you can really open up in a way you may not have before.

"
28 august 2016,pisces,"Chiron, the wounded healer, has taken up residence in your house of self-esteem for quite some time now. Its goal is to help you transcend the limits and problems of the past. Today it forms a luscious angle with the Moon in your house of romance and enjoying life. Let go of any crazy ideas that you’re not good enough or don’t deserve love and some time off.

"
29 august 2016,pisces,"Hmmm. Some interesting stuff is going on in the heavens, Pisces. Sexy Venus enters your house of libido today where she’ll remain for the next three weeks, stirring up your lust. But Mercury retrogrades tomorrow in your partnership zone which could bring up past resentment, grudges and fears. I suppose if you like fighting and making up with soul searing sex, these aspects are fine for you. But if you prefer less drama then tread warily.

"
30 august 2016,pisces,"With so much planetary energy focused on partnering up these days, you may have reached a point in which you say “enough!” Sometimes we just need some “me” time and that may become apparent as Mercury retrogrades today in your house of alliances. If there have been problems in a romantic or business relationship they may be dragged out into the light for reexamination–and discussion.

"
31 august 2016,pisces,"“Are you ready for the thing called love–don’t come from me and you it comes from up above. I ain’t no porcupine, take off your kid gloves. Are you ready for the thing called love?” Well, that just about says it all for you, Pisces. Songwriter John Hiatt penned these words years back and boy are they applicable to you! With tomorrow’s eclipse in the partnership zone and sexy Venus in the house of libido, you should definitely  be ready for that thang.

"
1 september 2016,pisces,"Cold feet? An amazing solar eclipse occurs today in your commitment sector, indicating that a serious keeper is on the way for singles. Already attached Pisces can find new passion and excitement in their romance. So why aren’t you jumping for joy? Blame Neptune, that murky planet of confusion. It’s stirring up doubts in your house of independence and taking care of #1. This too shall pass, however, and the next six months can be a game changer when it comes to amour.

"
2 september 2016,pisces,"Building relationships with partners, be they business or romantic, will be a breeze with a happy conjunction between chatty Mercury and generous Jupiter. Business deals could be quite profitable and past issues in love can be resolved. However, you have to ensure that your needs and priorities aren’t overlooked in the rush to shake hands or share a kiss.

"
3 september 2016,pisces,"It’s a wonderful weekend for having deep conversations with the people who mean the most to you. A happy Jupiter-Moon angle is designed to bring you closer together and let down the walls that may have prevented you from forming a stronger bond. A healing vibe between the Moon and Venus will let the most intense emotions flow with ease.

"
4 september 2016,pisces,"No good deed goes unpunished, and that’s the way you may feel today courtesy of some thankless planetary aspects! Seems like you have the best interests of others at heart, but no matter how much you try to help them, your advice and good deeds go unheeded and unappreciated. Let it go. When Jupiter enters Libra later this week you’ll be entering into quite a soulful, even metaphysical place in which you’ll be able to find meaning to others’ behavior.

"
5 september 2016,pisces,"Your ruler, Neptune, has been at odds with structured Saturn lately, forcing you to separate fact from fantasy. And as this energy builds as we head into the weekend, you may feel more and more frustrated about the practicality of some of your big dreams. The good news is that abundant Jupiter rolls into your house of fiscal strength on Friday, helping you locate the funding for your plans. It won’t happen overnight…you’ll have to hustle…but the opportunity is there.

"
6 september 2016,pisces,"Help could come form a surprising place as the cosmos is lining up supporters who believe in you. The interesting thing is that you may not even be aware that positive conversations are going on behind your back, and it may take some time for you to appreciate it. Just keep doing what you’re doing, as you’re doing a heck of a job impressing others.

"
7 september 2016,pisces,"Collaborations of all kinds are in the cards, with four celestial orbs winking at each other across the heavens. Whether it’s for business or pleasure, forming some kind of partnership with others can further your desires: finding love, making new friends, scoring a career coup, or lightening your load so that you can enjoy more free quality time.

"
8 september 2016,pisces,"Planetary influences are pushing you to build a more solid nest egg, and in order to do so you may need to take a second look at your career. Sure, clipping coupons helps, as well as making smart decisions when it comes to investing. However with the Moon, Mars and Saturn all piled in your tenth house of ambition and success, you could earn more of the green stuff by making yourself more valuable in the marketplace. This may mean starting a business on the side or changing jobs, but whatever you decide to do, the potential for more income is there.

"
9 september 2016,pisces,"Mailbox money. Earning dinero while you sleep. Passive income. Getting paid back for loans you made or court awards you’ve been waiting for. That’s what’s on tap this year as lucky Jupiter is now in your eighth house of savvy investing and financial security.  Oh, and here’s another benefit: your sex life should be fabulous. Do I hear anyone complaining? No? Thought so.

"
10 september 2016,pisces,"Today you might feel as though you’re stuck between a rock and a hard place as Saturn squares Neptune. Saturn is in your house of tradition, structure and following the rules. The question is: are you trying to bend or break them? Or are you suffocating yourself with the need to rigidly follow the rules? Find a happy place in between these two extremes.

"
11 september 2016,pisces,"Your own inner compass will guide you well, so think twice before taking the advice of others in your circle. They may think they know the best things for you to be doing and saying, but you need to make your own decisions under the current planetary influences.

"
12 september 2016,pisces,"Ready to take charge of your life? This week’s lunar eclipse in Pisces will push you to make some major decisions about the direction you’re headed in. And today you may be questioning your career options, as well as your romantic ones. If anything or anyone is holding you back you may cut those ties and blast forward.

"
13 september 2016,pisces,"People who have been taking you for granted, thinking they know all there is about you, your skills and personality are in for a big surprise in the months ahead! Shattering the illusions of others is what this week’s eclipse in Pisces is all about. Get ready to make some waves.

"
14 september 2016,pisces,"Your intuition and common sense are equally powerful today, thanks to a productive Moon-Uranus-Mars aspect. Pay close attention to emotions, thoughts and feelings that bubble up to the surface of your psyche. The upside? You clear out some of the mental trash that’s been building up, setting the stage for more clarity.

"
15 september 2016,pisces,"This could be quite an emotional day for you as the touchy-feely Moon connects with watery Neptune in your sign, Pisces. Feelings that have been buried for months, years even, could be rising to the surface. The best advice is to let them flow, and to not make any major decisions just yet. Tomorrow’s eclipse in your sign will shine its light on what you need to do next.

"
16 september 2016,pisces,"It’s all about you, Pisces! A sparkling lunar eclipse today in your sign is destined to push you into a more exciting lifestyle. Your days of hiding in the shadows are over, Cinderella, so toss that broom and those tired outfits. Change them for a new look and a brand new attitude. This might mean cutting the cord with people and circumstances that have been holding you back, but it’s either that or staying in the cellar, taking care of the evil step-sisters.

"
17 september 2016,pisces,"Yesterday’s eclipse was in your sign, Pisces, and it was designed for you to put an end to things that aren’t working for you and to start afresh. Today a magnificent Mars-Uranus trine is encouraging you to take a look at you biggest goals and ambitions, and get working on them. You may discover that things that were important to you even a few months ago no longer matter, thanks to Uranus wiping the slate clean.

"
18 september 2016,pisces,"You’re hell bent on making things happen. No ambition is too big for you too handle. All of this is good–unless you become too anxious to see results, especially the financial kind. Have no fear: when the Sun enters Libra later this week, you’ll have four weeks in which you can make progress.

"
19 september 2016,pisces,"An opportunity to increase your net worth is on the horizon, and you might catch wind of it today. A positive Mars-Venus aspect could encourage you to reach out to decision makers, investors, or financial advisors. Tuesday is good for holding talks, and when the Sun rolls into Libra on Thursday things can gain momentum.

"
20 september 2016,pisces,"Pluto is the planet of transformation. It acts like a building inspector, pointing out the weaknesses in a situation, and right now it’s focusing on your biggest dreams and wishes. Have you outgrown any previous goals? Maybe you’ve lost interest in a person or a situation and you’re ready to make some changes. If so, you’re in a good spot, as Pluto is in a fine angle all week to perceptive Mercury.

"
22 september 2016,pisces,"Yum. The Sun enters Libra, your eighth house of intimacy, bonding, and closeness—which includes sex! Let’s just say this, Pisces—you’re going to be one lusty creature. The Sun joins happy-go-lucky Jupiter, so between these two, your sex appeal (and appetite) could be off the charts.

"
23 september 2016,pisces,"Your emotions might be all over the place today, especially when it comes to matters of the heart: your kids, your lover or your family.  This is a temporary blip on the radar, so don’t sweat it. Next Monday is the best day in 2016 to resolve any problems or questions you might have.

"
24 september 2016,pisces,"Looks like someone’s been working too hard and could use some down time, and that someone is you! This is a great weekend to kick back with your friends and loved ones, but a tiny voice in your head may be telling you that you don’t have time for fun. Crush that tiny voice and get thee to the nearest watering hole for a cocktail with your tribe.

"
25 september 2016,pisces,"An opportunity could come your way in the weeks and months ahead to get ahead financially. However, there are some strings attached: you may need to go back to school, polish up your skills or learn to work more closely with others in a team environment. If you’re thinking about launching your own business, the timing is perfect. Just make sure that all your talents are up to snuff.

"
26 september 2016,pisces,"Satisfaction comes in many forms, but for most people it is derived from closeness with a loved one and being financially secure. Well, you’re in luck, Pisces, because the annual Sun-Jupiter meeting occurs in your house of intimacy, bonding and wealth. Yes, both love and money are found in the eighth house, and these two luminaries meet today in one of the most fortuitous angles possible. This is soulmate territory, along with building a large nest egg through savvy investing, joint ventures or even your own entrepreneurial launch.

"
27 september 2016,pisces,"Hope you’re well rested! Guns ablazin’ Mars rolls into your house of friendship and camaraderie, kicking open a seven week period in which you should be trying to meet as many new people as possible. While you’re at it, connect with your existing tribe too. In the past few months you may have been reflecting about the quality of your connections, courtesy of Pluto in retrograde here. If certain ties need to be cut, do so with the knowledge that as one door closes, another one opens.

"
28 september 2016,pisces,"You can make headway with close personal relationships today as long as you’re realistic about your expectations. Whether it’s a friend, business alliance or a lover, keep it real. Focus on what comes next in your partnership rather than what you’d like to see happening five years from now. Take care of the present first.

"
29 september 2016,pisces,"Seems like your self-esteem could use a little boost, and the cosmos may deliver that today! You may have a sudden understanding that you’re worth more as a human being than you had previously thought. This isn’t a conceited attitude but a healthy realization that you have a lot to offer–especially in romantic relationships.

"
30 september 2016,pisces,"There could be friction between you and a boss or client, and the key is to not kid yourself about what’s going down. You may initially feel as though they’re calling all the shots but you have more power than you might realize. Abundant Jupiter is in your house of financial security, protecting your interests. Focus instead on building net worth rather than on the dramas caused by other people.

"
1 october 2016,pisces,"Ready for better sex and more intimacy? Who isn’t! And how about more cash coming your way, and I’m not talking about chump change? Ditto. Pisces, you’re in a sweet spot as today’s new moon occurs in your eighth house of deep bonding and financial security. An amorous trine between the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, also takes place making this a good weekend to talk about future plans with your lover. Venus is encouraging you to think bigger and bolder in all areas of your life, so if you don’t have a bucket list, create one now.

"
2 october 2016,pisces,"Getting real about your feelings should be an easier task as the Sun inches ever closer to stable Saturn. No matter what your age, a greater maturity is coming your way in the near future as you’ll be able to get to the bottom of things that may have been troubling you. Today is excellent for some self-healing via meditation or a nice quiet walk in nature.

"
3 october 2016,pisces,"The early part of this week is well aspected for making major decisions about your finances, Pisces. Whether you need to go after an ex for child support, talk to an investment adviser about a retirement fund or start a business on the side, your actions will have long term (and positive!) ramifications.

"
4 october 2016,pisces,"Giving up your own personal power to others is never a good idea, and fortunately for you, a strong Sun-Saturn meet up is enabling you to take more control of your life. The Sun is in the house of your deepest emotions, shining its light on what thought patterns are stymying you and which are helpful. With disciplined Saturn in your house of authority, you can develop positive new mental habits that will stick around for a long time.

"
5 october 2016,pisces,"It’s time to get practical about your finances, and with intelligent Mercury heading into this part of your chart on Friday, you’ll be in good shape to make solid plans. A helpful Sun-Saturn aspect today gets the ball rolling, especially if you feel the need to take more control of your fiscal future. Talk to the boss about a raise, shop your resume or research ways to pull in more revenues for your company.

"
6 october 2016,pisces,"Now that Mars and Pluto are both in your house of networking, the company you keep is all important. And over the next few days you’ll need to keep a sharp eye on the people in your circle, as one of them might be creating a problem in a group dynamic. Slacking, jealousy, infighting, quiet resistance—all of these can erupt, and with optimistic Jupiter in your house of emotions you may be tempted to overlook bad behavior. Don’t—this energy goes on for another ten days or so. Better to squash it now.

"
7 october 2016,pisces,"With quick witted Mercury entering your house of financial savvy, you’re in good shape to make progress in building solid revenues or a bigger bank account. But you’ve gotta keep an eye on the people around you, as there could be some bad apples in the lot. Perform due diligence before hiring an attorney to file a suit. Get references from an investment advisor before you invest. If you work on a team (or head one), sniff out trolls, blabber mouths, divas or those who seem just a tad too competitive. This vibe will continue into the middle of the month, so forewarned is forearmed.

"
8 october 2016,pisces,"It’s now what you know, it’s who you know, and those words ring true this weekend. With the Moon joining both Mars and Pluto in your house of camaraderie, you must  get out there and expand your contact list! The terrific thing is that the people you surround yourself with over the next few days could be highly inspirational to you, opening your mind to new possibilities.

"
9 october 2016,pisces,"Keep a close eye on friends and team members as erratic Uranus is active. One of them may be determined to upset the apple cart by slacking or somehow undermining a productive venture. The good news is that wise Pluto in your networking sector will point out the bad apple(s). And Venus in your expansive ninth house will keep your plans on track.

"
10 october 2016,pisces,"Do what you can to expand your contact list, especially when it comes to your career. A friend or someone you know from an industry you’re interested in could put in a good word for you in the weeks ahead, but you have to let them know that you’re looking. If you’re considering starting a business or entering into a joint venture, tomorrow is one of the best days all year to perform research and talk to others.

"
11 october 2016,pisces,"Sex, intimacy and cold hard cash—the ancients placed these in the same astrological house! Even back then these drove human behavior. Well, you’re in luck today when it comes to matters of the heart and wallet as a generous meeting occurs between abundant Jupiter and sage Mercury. Your libido and net worth can both increase under this audacious aspect.

"
12 october 2016,pisces,"Feeling emo? You might be, considering that the Moon is swinging past vibey Neptune in your sign. These two orbs are squaring Saturn, a rather tense angle. Someone may be putting pressure on you—to perform at work, do things their way within the family, or just bust chops (like you need that). Keep calm and carry on, as the remainder of the week looks like an emotional one all around. The full moon on Sunday helps put you in control.

"
13 october 2016,pisces,"It’s wonderful to have friends, but in our Facebook/Instagram world it’s so easy to get carried away as we compare our lives to other’s. Jealousy and resentment could rear their ugly little heads today as FOMO (fear of missing out) is triggered. You want happiness and the good things in life? Create it! With discipline Saturn in such a helpful place from the house of dreaming big, you can make things happen.

"
14 october 2016,pisces,"With Saturn in your house of tradition “open relationships” and shaky romances aren’t your thing. You’re looking for stability in love (and in work too for that matter), and today the planets are trying to help you find it. With candid Mercury in your house of emotions and bonding, speak up about your concerns. You can get to the bottom of matters and work on a long term solution.

"
15 october 2016,pisces,"An unexpected event or remark could throw you off kilter today, resulting in churned up emotions. You may feel as though your security is being threatened in some way, and perhaps as though some of your dreams or plans are now delayed. Nothing could be further from the truth. Tomorrow’s full moon in Aries helps you gain control of your habits and routines, regardless as to what the world may throw at you.

"
16 october 2016,pisces,"Nothing like having a super moon in the income sector! Yup, a powerful lunation helps you wrap up financial matters, such as a job search, negotiating a raise, putting together a budget or starting a business. To be honest, erratic Uranus is acting up, which could bring an unexpected expense your way. Be careful not to put too much on plastic this week either. But overall, your aspects for earning more are superb.

"
17 october 2016,pisces,"Everybody wants to earn more, but of all the signs you’ll be the most motivated to do so! Yesterday’s full moon in your income sector is pushing you to make changes that will put more cash in your wallet. And today a super Moon-Pluto trine is perfect for contacting people you know and networking at industry events. Think about who can help you reach a higher level–then make the phone call or send them a text.

"
18 october 2016,pisces,"You’re cooking with gas on the career front, Pisces! Sunday’s full moon fell in your house of income, closing out a chapter in which you may not have been earning as much as you would like. Well that’s about to change, starting today. Profitable, lucky Venus glides into your tenth house of ambition and success for a three-week stay. Doors that may have been closed in the past may start to crack open, so make sure you’re ready for good things that might come your way.

"
19 october 2016,pisces,"Doors may start opening for you, Pisces, but it won’t happen unless you decide to start working your contact list. Whether it’s finding a new mate, getting the approval to join a club or landing a sweet promotion, right now it’s all about who you know. A meeting today between Mars and Pluto is designed to help you change your circumstances with the help of other people. Start schmoozing.

"
20 october 2016,pisces,"Your income and expenses could be gyrating these days, all the more reason to create a steady source of income. Even if you already have a secure paycheck the cosmos suggests that you hunt down a second source that you can depend on. The recent full moon in your earnings sector was all about ending your days of worrying about money. Get started now.

"
21 october 2016,pisces,"How creatively are you living your life? Do you always fall back on “the usual”? As in—the foods you eat, the vacation spots you travel to, the safe old bars and restaurants and movie theaters? A Moon-Mars-Pluto opposition today is telling you to take a few chances. Maybe you’re hiding behind a wall of safety, which could be nothing but a rut in disguise. You only live once. Make sure there’s a bit of adventure on your journey.

"
22 october 2016,pisces,"Your income and expenses could be gyrating these days, all the more reason to create a steady source of income. Even if you already have a secure paycheck the cosmos suggests that you hunt down a second source that you can depend on. The recent full moon in your earnings sector was all about ending your days of worrying about money. Get started now.

"
23 october 2016,pisces,"Getting real is what it’s all about today with a fuzzy Jupiter-Neptune aspect. These two are quite inspirational, but they could also lead to some LaLa Land thinking. Not good, considering that Jupiter is in your house of financial security and romantic intimacy. If you’re wearing rose colored glasses, take them off. Don’t put anyone on a pedestal or leave your finances totally in the hands of others.

"
24 october 2016,pisces,"Make your opinion count! Now that intelligent Mercury is in your house of higher thinking, joining the Sun, your brain should be on fire with clever ideas. This is a very mind-expanding vibe, so consider taking a class, listening to TED talks, going to a lecture or book signing, or even traveling to a new location. People from different cultures, be they modern or ancient, could be your best source of inspiration right now.

"
25 october 2016,pisces,"Don’t kid yourself about a career situation today. If your gut is telling you that something’s off, it probably is. Also, be wary about entering into a workplace romance, as it could head south pretty quickly under current planetary aspects. As a matter of fact, it’s wise to take more of an in-charge role when it comes to love. Don’t let your partner make all of the decisions.

"
26 october 2016,pisces,"With generous Jupiter in your house of financial strength for the first time in over a decade, you’ll enjoy a number of days in the year ahead that will help you build a bigger nest egg. Today is one of them, as profitable Venus links up with abundant Jupiter. Venus is in your career house, so consider asking for a raise and more responsibility, searching for a new job, expanding your business or even changing industries.

"
27 october 2016,pisces,"“Live free or die” may be the motto of the state of New Hampshire, but it’s also Pisces’ battle cry today. A powerful meeting of the Sun and Mercury in your independent ninth house will stir you to do your own thing, whatever that means to you: demanding some alone time to pursue hobbies or just to relax, creating a little “space” between you and a lover, going the entrepreneurial route, backpacking across Tibet or doing some freelancing on the side.

"
28 october 2016,pisces,"What is your gut telling you about moving forward with a particular plan of action? A strong Jupiter-Moon connection puts you in touch with some deep feelings and thoughts and you would be wise to heed them. Maybe you’re worried about being hurt or misled again, a possibility with Chiron, the wounded one, in a prominent position. But the current planetary vibes indicate that you can do well in the near future, so be open.

"
29 october 2016,pisces,"Something may suddenly inspire you to take charge of a situation, Pisces, and this is all for the better. Whether it’s your finances, a romantic situation, a family matter or a cherished dream, a new routine seems to be needed. The good news is that Saturn, planet of discipline, is nearby, helping you set new habits and activities in motion–and make them stick.

"
30 october 2016,pisces,"In a rut? Then it’s time to bust out of it! A sparkling new moon in your house of adventure and taking chances occurs today Pisces, and it’s a winner. Neptune, planet of thinking outside the box, is also active, indicating that it’s time to see yourself in a whole new light. It may take others a while to witness the changes in you, but hey–you’ll enjoy the shocked looks on their faces. Neptune happens to be the planet of drama too!

"
31 october 2016,pisces,"Duty or freedom? Follow the rules or break them? You’re caught between dueling planets, some of which are telling you to cut loose, others which are tsk-tsking under their breath. It’s like the old cartoons with the devil on one shoulder and the angel on the other. But his isn’t about doing wrong–it’s more about living life your own way versus following tradition–and everyone else’s expectations of you.

"
1 november 2016,pisces,"You’re in a good position to make big plans and go after some pretty lofty ambitions, Pisces. The Sun forms an aspect with Neptune today that will help clear up some doubts that you’ve had in the past few months about heading down a certain path. You may be worried that you’re considering things that are out of your league or are too much of a stretch, but don’t worry–sober Saturn in your house of ambition will keep your feet on the ground.

"
2 november 2016,pisces,"Big dreams often cost big money, and fortunately for you the planets want to deliver the goods. A lofty Mercury-Pluto aspect tomorrow will encourage you to take risks and stretch past previous boundaries. Then on Saturday, the planets may suddenly show you the way to earning more. The key is to remain open minded about what life offers you; to your surprise there could be some juicy changes coming your way.

"
3 november 2016,pisces,"We’ve all heard the fun phrase “so many men, so little time” but how often do you have so many bright ideas, and so little time in which to accomplish them? That’s the case right now for you, Pisces, as the Sun and quick witted Mercury in the most forward thinking part of your chart are making you feel like you can take on the world. Problem is, there are only 24 hours in a day. Start prioritizing.

"
4 november 2016,pisces,"The more people you meet these days, the better off you’ll be in the future. The cosmos is advising you to expand your social network. That’s not to suggest that your existing tribe isn’t good enough. However, your life is ready to take off on some new and exciting tangents, and you’ll need mentors and guides along the way, not to mention companionship.

"
5 november 2016,pisces,"You certainly have no shortage of bright ideas these days, especially when they come to making more money, meeting new people and exploring the world. Start creating a bucket list because over the next four weeks you’ll be able to start bringing these brainstorms to life. Once Mars enters Aquarius on Wednesday, you’ll be going into highly strategic phase.

"
6 november 2016,pisces,"A number of planets in your career and income sectors are encouraging you to seek out more ways of making money. If you’ve been engaged in conversations with others on this topic, or have been researching the matter, it’s time to stop talking and analyzing. The full moon on the 14th tells you to wrap up this phase and move on to making things happen. When Mercury enters your house of ambition on the 12th, it’s green lights ahead.

"
7 november 2016,pisces,"It’s not enough to have fabulous ideas; you have to turn them into gold, like an alchemist who starts with lead. Today you have that alchemical wizardry with a positive Pluto-Sun aspect. When Mars enters the house of the subconscious mind on Wednesday for the first time in two years, your creativity will be off the charts. Run with it.

"
8 november 2016,pisces,"You’re about to enter an interesting time in which you’ll need to be both friendly and outgoing, yet secretive; authoritative yet passive. Three planets are changing signs later this week, some of which are pushing you into the spotlight while others warn to not share too much about your plans. The key is to balance quiet time with socializing, and to release confidential information only on an as-needed basis.

"
9 november 2016,pisces,"Get ready for a burst of inspiration! Spicy Mars barrels into the house of the subconscious mind, stirring up some serious mojo. Obviously this is fabulous news if you are a creative, but all Pisceans can benefit from this cosmic gift. The best way to finesse it is too carve out down time to work on things that mean a lot to you: your garden, a manuscript, your spiritual path, or improving your physical and mental health. The payoff will please you immensely.

"
10 november 2016,pisces,"Get out of the way! Pisces is on a roll as the Moon connects today with inspirational Neptune. They form a fabulous link with the Sun in the most optimistic and forward-thinking part of your chart, telling you to go big or go home. Nothin’ but green lights ahead.

"
11 november 2016,pisces,"Got any doubts about what to do about a certain situation? Now that Mars is in the sector that governs fears, worries and negative thoughts, your brain might be in overdrive, coming up with dramatic scenarios which may or may not be true. If that’s the case talk to a trusted friend, mentor or colleague. With helpful Venus now in the friendliest part of your chart, don’t muddle through issues all by yourself. Seek the wisdom of someone who cares about you.

"
12 november 2016,pisces,"It’s time to talk turkey, Pisces. No, I’m not referring to Thanksgiving dinner. I’m talking about the almighty dollar. Intelligent, quick witted Mercury is now in your ambition sector, urging you to get you financial future in order. You may need to do some quiet research but reach out to people who can help you move up in your career. It’s not just what you know but who you know that is your ticket to success.

"
13 november 2016,pisces,"If your gut is telling you that something is off, or about to happen in a career matter, it’s worth noting. A strong Mars-Mercury angle is tipping you off about changes that are afoot. Does this spell doom and gloom? Absolutely not! The time may be right for moving on to a new gig or heading down the entrepreneurial path. The next three weeks can be game changers.

"
14 november 2016,pisces,"Wrap up important projects that deal with self-expression, Pisces! A full moon today encourages you to finish the Great American Novel you’ve been working on, your thesis, a social media campaign or simply an important conversation that needs to be held with someone. Heart-to-heart talks with a lover could be somewhat difficult due to a Jupiter-Pluto square, but that doesn’t mean that you should avoid the matter. Your intuition is in high gear, so use that to your advantage.

"
16 november 2016,pisces,"With your ruler Neptune currently in retrograde motion, your self-confidence could be vacillating. One minute you feel on top of things, the next you’re beating yourself up. You’re yearning to feel more in control of your mindset and that chance is coming soon. Once Neptune goes direct on Saturday, a sense of authority and direction returns.

"
17 november 2016,pisces,"Who’s the boss in your closest relationships? With your ruler, Neptune, in retrograde motion you may be vacillating between being active and passive. You may even be craving more independence or space. But the planets indicate that you can find a happy medium between being involved and having some autonomy. Once the Sun moves into Sagittarius you’ll start feeling more in control.

"
18 november 2016,pisces,"Your self-esteem could take a bit of a beating as someone dishes out some criticism your way. This person could be a boss or just someone copping a bossy attitude, and you may feel confused as to how to respond. The best bet is to say as little as possible as you run the risk of coming across the wrong way. You’ll feel more in control within a few days.

"
19 november 2016,pisces,"Woo-hoo! Your ruler goes direct today, ending a potentially indecisive period in which you may have felt stuck in a rut. Even if you knew exactly what to do next, others around you may have been stalling or unwilling to commit. And with the Sun moving into your house of authority on Monday it’s time to be the Boss Lady or Man or your own life.

"
20 november 2016,pisces,"Lights, camera, action! Now that Neptune has gone direct in your sign, it’s time to start making forward progress with your plans. Tomorrow the Sun glides into your house of ambition and success, damn good timing if you ask me. And today the Moon forms a helpful aspect with Uranus, telling you to sharpen your skills as you get ready for a busy month ahead.

"
21 november 2016,pisces,"Got big plans for your career? Now is the time to get moving with them, even though the holidays are approaching. Next week’s new moon on the 29th can open up doors, so be ready to talk to important people in the next few weeks. Now that the Sun is in Sagittarius you can take action on all  of your goals, not just career choices. This weekend is terrific for ruminating about what you’d like to see in 2017. Vision board, anyone?

"
22 november 2016,pisces,"Does moving up the ladder have to mean giving up on other dreams and goals? Some people are of the school that says you have to choose between career and family, or the pursuit of money versus contentment. But that’s not you, Pisces. The planetary aspects on offer this week indicate that you can have your cake and eat it too.

"
23 november 2016,pisces,"It’s time to talk turkey, and I’m not referring to the bird that will be on the dining room table tomorrow. Heck no, I’m talkin’ money—the big kind. Like from a raise, new job or adding profitable revenue streams to your company. A power lunch today between shrewd negotiator Mercury and stable Saturn is perfect for gaining the praise and acknowledgment that you deserve, not to mention the dinero. The new moon on the 29th opens up a two-week window in which you can really self-promote.

"
24 november 2016,pisces,"With happy-g0-lucky Jupiter in your emotional eighth house, you may feel c0mfortable in being an open book, but today’s planetary aspects warn against being too easy to read. Someone in your circle, a friend perhaps, may try to take advantage of your good nature. That being said, there are plenty of people around you who are quality folks. Be selective as to whom you spend your time with.

"
25 november 2016,pisces,"Your most closely held dreams and wishes are the focus of the planets today. Pluto, the great transformer, is asking you to reconsider what it is that you really want as your tastes may have changed. Luxe Venus is by his side, which could be encouraging you to slow down, perhaps, and smell the flowers as you travel along life’s path. This doesn’t mean that you’re going to give up on your aspirations. But you could decide to add more quality down time to your schedule.

"
26 november 2016,pisces,"If you can think it, you can do it. That’s the message the cosmos has for you today Pisces. But it’s not enough to just dream up bright ideas. The proof is in the execution, and with rebellious Uranus in fine form you should be able to dream up new procedures and rituals for making your goals come true.

"
28 november 2016,pisces,"All systems are go, Pisces! A terrific new moon tomorrow can open doors in love, emotional healing, your career and going after just about any goal you can think of. Just don’t expect everyone around you to be on board with your plans. It’s possible they lack the discipline to do what you have in mind. Don’t let anyone dissuade you from taking action.

"
29 november 2016,pisces,"“Fake it til you make it” is a phrase that we hear a lot, especially when it comes to taking on new responsibilities–and you’re not sure if you have the chops to handle them. Today’s new moon presents such a situation as it falls in your house of authority and ambition. But murky Neptune swirls its fog, making you question your abilities. You do have what it takes, and the best way to find out is to go within. Mars is in the house of the subconscious mind, stirring up inspiration galore.

"
30 november 2016,pisces,"Someone in a position of authority could say or do something that will confound you today, Pisces, but think before you respond—and act. The problem is that Neptune is clouding your vision, so it’s possible that you are misreading the situation. Not everyone is out to get you, so just chill and wait for the day to pass. You may soon realize that there was nothing to be upset about.

"
2 december 2016,pisces,"Reach out and touch someone! Chatty Mercury zips into your house of camaraderie today, setting the stage for socializing and networking. The people on your contact list could be influential in introducing you to potential lovers, employers, friends, and business people. This is also the house that governs technology, so if you are in the process of launching a website or online marketing blitz, now’s the time. Get it done before the 19th when Mercury retrogrades.

"
3 december 2016,pisces,"It’s not always necessary to show others who’s the boss, and today you are encouraged to keep your personal power under wraps. This doesn’t mean being a doormat or not speaking your piece. But sometimes it’s smarter to let everyone underestimate you—then shock the daylights out of them later with your success!

"
4 december 2016,pisces,"Chill, grasshopper. The cosmos is telling you to get in touch with the quiet, wise part of your psyche that knows how to heal and nurture your tired mind and body. Take a few moments today to consider what needs to be done to feel more centered and relaxed. When Venus changes signs on Wednesday your progress will accelerate.

"
5 december 2016,pisces,"Change is in the air as the emotional Moon signals spontaneous Uranus. Don’t be surprised if you suddenly redirect your attention and energies to a new course of action, something that is more in tune with the person you’re becoming. This is positive, by the way, and will result in your creating new habits and rituals that are more in sync with your deepest passions.

"
6 december 2016,pisces,"Sometimes you just need to break from the crowd and do your own thing. And often times you don’t need to make a big announcement about it. So while others are pontificating about their brand, their next move, their likes and dislikes, all you have to do is keep on truckin’. Keep your eye on the prize and sally forth.
.

"
7 december 2016,pisces,"Put on your trench coat and dark glasses—you’re going into secret agent mode. Venus moves into your ultra hush-hush twelfth house, the place where we do things below the radar: look for a new job, quietly go on a diet, have an affair or launch a side business. This is also a good time to ruminate over your 2017 resolutions and figure out your next move. The key is to keep things on the downlow. Not everyone needs to know every single detail of your life.

"
8 december 2016,pisces,"Now that magnetic Venus is in the more secluded part of your chart, you may want to tone things down. As in—your words, opinions, appearance and actions. But don’t be afraid that you’ll turn into a crushing bore. With a serious meeting coming on Saturday between the Sun and Saturn, you’re going to have some major decisions to make. Slow down now and take stock.

"
9 december 2016,pisces,"With the mighty Sun in your career house you’re in an excellent position to make headway. An auspicious aspect today between the Sun and Jupiter recommends that you consider perks as well as income and prestige. Hey, if you can score a better benefits package, go for it. This includes retirement plans, profit sharing and the like, so pay attention to your bottom line.

"
10 december 2016,pisces,"With the mighty Sun blazing a path through your house of ambition lately, you may have felt optimistic and ready to take on the world. But today El Sol meets up with serious Saturn, asking you to slow down a bit. Have you taken on too much? Are your goals and plans realistic? Do you need the advice or assistance of others? Make sure you’re not heading down a path that leads to burnout.

"
11 december 2016,pisces,"You may be asked to join a team or group, or to provide your skills to someone else’s efforts. If that’s the case you should consider it carefully, as a positive Moon-Pluto aspect indicates that this could bring about some happy results in the future. With the Sun blazing away in your house of personal ambition it may be easy to forget that you can go far if you travel your path with others.

"
12 december 2016,pisces,"With two of the most powerful orbs in the solar system, Saturn and the Sun, stationed in your ambition sector you’re really coming into your own as a thinker and a doer. Today sparkles with a special aspect that can help you gain favorable attention, not to mention more cash. Cutting edge ideas are the way to go, and with dynamic Mars about to enter your sign on the 19th, don’t hold back.

"
13 december 2016,pisces,"Ready to be center stage? I certainly hope so, because assertive Mars will be rolling into your sign next week, lighting a fire under you to pursue your passions. The full moon today in your domestic sector urges you to put an end to family or housing dramas, whatever they might be: selling your home, a spat with your parents, kicking out an annoying room mate or working our custody agreements with your ex. You may need to take ownership of matters rather than letting them run their own course, but you’ll be glad you did.

"
14 december 2016,pisces,"Everyone wants a peaceful home and family life, but that doesn’t mean becoming the family doormat in order to achieve peace. If you’re giving more than you’re getting back, it’s time to make others aware that you have your own needs to attend to. The same holds true for friendships that feel draining. The planets are telling you that some self-care and indulgence is necessary right now.

"
15 december 2016,pisces,"A routine or event could get thrown off schedule by a friend, lover or child today. Don’t lose your cool and let it pass, as this is a minor blip on the radar. However, if the people around you are constantly creating roadblocks, last minute crises or are procrastinating, you don’t have to deal with it. When assertive Mars enters your sign next week you’ll be able to put them in their place!

"
17 december 2016,pisces,"Something new and unexpected could show up on your desk today, perhaps an assignment that can take you further than you might imagine. It could also be a job offer. To make the most of this energy, reach out to others who can help you make your mark. In sales or marketing? Then prospect like mad today, as the people you connect with could end up being paying clients down the road. Long term financial benefits could arise from today’s efforts for all Pisces.

"
18 december 2016,pisces,"Who needs to wait til New Year’s Eve to toss out the old and ring in the new? Not you, Pisces! In 24 hours red hot Mars will be entering your sign for the first time in two years. So finish up old business, make some firm decisions about who and what you’d like to have in your life in the year ahead, and start cleaning house. You may actually feel resistant to change today thanks to a Moon-Mars opposition, but that’s OK. You’ll be in the driver’s seat before you know it.

"
19 december 2016,pisces,"You know the saying: if you want to get something done the right way, do it yourself? That may be the way it has to be as Mercury retrogrades today in your house of teamwork. From now until mid-January, group activities may go off the rails due to miscommunication or slacking off on the part of team members. To top it off, aggressive Mars enters Pisces, making you determined to plow through projects. Get moving.

"
20 december 2016,pisces,"Trust issues? With Mercury retrograde in your house of networking and friends you may be wondering who you can count on. Don’t worry—if there are any slackers or frenemies in your midst, they can quickly be replaced! When the Sun enters Capricorn tomorrow, you’ll be meeting a lot of new faces, some of whom will play a big role in your life in the years to come.

"
21 december 2016,pisces,"You’re entering a highly social time now that the Sun is in your house of networking, Pisces! And with charismatic Mars in your sign, you are sparkling like the brightest star in the heavens. So get out of wallflower mode and start strutting your stuff. People will be interested in your opinions, talents, background and where you’re heading. Give ‘em a good show.

"
22 december 2016,pisces,"Your options for building a stronger financial base are improving, Pisces, but you have to make sure that you’ve set some money aside for mundane expenses and emergencies. It’s easy to get fired up about that hot stock tip or a business idea that you’d like to launch but you can’t neglect the day-to-day stuff. Create a solid budget before you plan world domination and the riches that go along with it.

"
23 december 2016,pisces,"A dazzling new self-image may be on your mind today, thanks to a happy Moon-Mars aspect. A feeling of adventure will take hold as La Luna transits the part of your chart that encourages taking risks. Next Tuesday the 27th is a super day to get clear about some of the dreams you’d like to pursue in 2017. Vision boards, anyone?

"
24 december 2016,pisces,"A rare meetup between Saturn and Uranus demands that you think long and hard about your long term plans. Wishful thinking doesn’t cut it here. Get real about your ambitions and the steps you’ll need to take to get there.

"
25 december 2016,pisces,"You’re in a deeply soulful place these days with a number of planets in the vibiest part of your chart. Finding people who share your passions and ideas is something that you should consider, especially with the new moon this Thursday falling in your house of camaraderie. Keep the old pals around, but seek out some new ones who will stimulate your mind.

"
26 december 2016,pisces,"It’s a day to dream big–really  big–thanks to a happy meeting between intelligent Mercury and inspirational Neptune. But you might discover, as you’re creating that vision board or jotting things down on a pad of paper, that your dreams may cost more than you had realized. One of the problems is that erratic Uranus has been retrograde in your house of earnings. The good news? It goes direct on Thursday, so don’t give up on your big plans.

"
27 december 2016,pisces,"It’s time for you to come out of a shell and start to network more. Over the next few weeks you should be considering joining industry or trade groups, single meet ups, and volunteer organizations. Sign up for seminars or weekend workshops while you’re at it. Being around more like-minded people will add a sense of satisfaction to your life that you may not have experienced before.

"
28 december 2016,pisces,"With energetic Mars in your sign for the first time in two years, your needs and dreams are front and center. But what’s the best way to achieve them? A Sun-Mercury conjunction today encourages you to seek out sage advice from someone who can help you. Whether it’s a friend, attorney, savvy expert, life coach or spiritual adviser, make the connections. Then keep the lines of communication open as over the next few weeks they can help you enormously.

"
29 december 2016,pisces,"Lucky you! The cosmos is setting the stage for making new friends and developing important contacts over the next six months. Some of these folks could be instrumental in moving your career and income along, so consider where and how you could be mingling with industry people. Romance is in the stars also, as a pal could make an introduction to someone new.

"
30 december 2016,pisces,"Your friends can be more than just people to share good times with. Let’s face it, they know you best and understand what you do right and where you trip yourself up. If you want an honest opinion about the latter, reach out to a trusted pal and ask for their advice. The unvarnished truth can really set you free.

"
31 december 2016,pisces,"Some people let their self-worth get tied in too much with their occupation or income level. Others are far too worried about competing with their friends. Now that Uranus has gone direct in the house that governs your fondest hopes and wishes, you can get down to the essence of what really floats your  boat, without resorting to head games and useless comparisons.
