"
5 january 2019,aries,"Hurt feelings can be patched up thanks to a lunar aspect that wants you to feel better about yourself. You don’t even have to have a conversation with someone in order to heal.

"
6 january 2019,aries,"Got #goals? If so, then you’ll love today’s sizzling aspects. First there’s a solar eclipse in your house of ambition and success.

"
7 january 2019,aries,"Ggrrrr!!!! Feel like taking a risk in love? Or maybe you want to add a bit of uh, spice,  to your relationship. Then you’ll be pleased to know that amorous Venus enters your house of free-spirited thinking today. However, this isn’t just about being kinky, so stop thinking 50 Shades. This is more about taking exotic vacations together, dating a brand new type or going to new venues on date night.

"
8 january 2019,aries,"Raging against “the machine” could backfire on you big time, Aries. This could mean your boss, a government agency, a cop who pulls you over or a key decision maker. Keep calm and carry on.

"

"

"
17 january 2019,aries,"Keep your opinions to yourself today. A Moon-Venus opposition indicates that something could be taken wrong way, no matter how diplomatic you are. Don’t put yourself out on a limb in any manner: in writing, contractually, you name it. Tomorrow, though, the situation is quite different.

"
18 january 2019,aries,"It’s time to make some major decisions about the direction your life is heading in. Intelligent Mercury meets up with transformational Pluto in your house of goals. You may suddenly rebel against a person or situation that has been holding you back. Bravo!

"

If you have felt stuck in a key area of your life, then rest easy. Neptune, that dreamy planet of the subconscious mind, is inspiring you. The good thing is that logical Saturn is in a positive angle too, ensuring that fresh ideas will be well thought out…. and not crazy!

"
1 february 2019,aries,"
Ouch! The two most obstinate planets in the solar system, Mars and Pluto, square off. The temptation to mouth off will be strong; the problem is that you run the risk of telling An Important Person to go f*** off. Probably not your best move. 

"
2 february 2019,aries,"

There’s a saying about people. They can either be like anchors on a boat, holding you down, or they can be like motors, propelling you forward. Find some new motors and dump the anchors, Aries.

"
6 february 2019,aries,"
Feeling a bit worn out? It’s possible with the Moon in Pisces. Chill out. Relax. Pamper yourself. Take a nap. Call in sick to work. Recharge your batteries, because you have a very social week ahead.

"
7 february 2019,aries,"
A dazzling Sun-Jupiter aspect could bring some amazing people your way, Aries. Keep an open mind. Some of these folks could be quite different than the types you’re used to. You’re not the shy boring type, and these folks certainly know how to live.

"

Money will be on your mind today, Aries. With the inspirational Moon forming a trine with Saturn in your career zone, you should be considering all of the ways that you can bring more financial stability to your life. This may mean cutting back on spending, but long run it will be worth it.

"
12 march 2019,aries,"
Shhhh!!! Keep your mouth shut, ram. I don’t care if you’re the savviest person in the room. That’s the whole problem: you may very well be the smartest person in the room, and by talking you will divulge too much. The dream stealers and passive aggressive types are out today. Also, watch out for over promising something, as you may not be able to deliver it.

"
13 march 2019,aries,"
You should be feeling more powerful and in control, thanks to macho Pluto in a feisty place. But as the ancient Taoist warrior-monks understood, true power is best hidden from prying eyes. Keep your strength a secret and quietly move ahead with your agenda.

"
14 march 2019,aries,"
Keep your Spidey sense turned all the way up today, as your intuition will be right on target. This is super helpful as there is so much planetary activity going on in your ambition sector. Cosmic wisdom will come your way.

"
15 march 2019,aries,"
Are you dying to be in the spotlight? It’s not a good move under current cosmic skies. No matter how talented you are, or how much you want to share your ideas, you’re better off remaining silent. Don’t worry, this energy doesn’t last long. Sit tight for another week.

"
16 march 2019,aries,"
Things that used to seem difficult may now be easier to handle, Aries. That’s because you are stepping into a place of greater personal power. This is good news, as the Sun will be entering your sign next Wednesday. As they say, “more power to you!”

"

If you want the good things in life, the cosmos has your back. Assertive Mars is in your house of goals and success, propelling you forward. However, today is not so much a day for action as it is for thinking things through. Once the Sun moves into your sign on Wednesday,It’s time to kick things up a few notches.

"
18 march 2019,aries,"
Rome wasn’t built in a day, Aries! And your dreams are going to take a while to manifest also. Don’t let this get you down. Adjust your expectations and be more realistic about timelines.

Intuition and creativity go off the charts today, thanks to a Mercury-Neptune meet up! Use this energy for problem solving, developing your talent, snooping, or just having fun with hobbies. This vibe continues all week, so enjoy it.

"
25 march 2019,aries,"
Someone could provide you with excellent advice, so if you’re smart you’ll pay attention to it. You rams can be stubborn at times. The intel you receive could pull you out of a rut, all the more reason to listen.

"
27 march 2019,aries,"When the going gets tough, the tough get going. That’s an old, well worn phrase, and as a stubborn ram you know this better than anyone. But with Venus in your twelfth house it’s time to figure out ways to move forward without expending so much freakin’energy.

"
31 march 2019,aries,"The floodgates open! Mars enters your oh-so-chatty communications sector, telling you to get your message out there. Your brain will be crackling with ideas and people will be interested in what you have to say. The next two months are superb for socializing and short distance travel. Single rams, your best bet for meeting someone is right in your own neighborhood.

"
7 april 2019,aries,"Spend some quiet time today thinking about your long range goals, whatever they might be.

Consider your personal happiness too.

"
8 april 2019,aries,"You may be concerned about your money situation, but things could change in a very interesting way. Subterranean Pluto is helping you come up with new ideas that will increase the size of your bank balance. Just don’t go up against any authority figures this week, especially on Wednesday and Saturday. As my grandma used to say, “keep your cards close to your vest”. Keep quiet and play dumb.

"
9 april 2019,aries,"Someone may serve up some criticism today, and you will NOT be in the mood for it. Instead of going on the warpath, quietly pull away and mull things over. Your intuition is high and should be on point. Is there any truth to the criticism? If not, don’t sweat it. You’ve got better things to worry about than someone’s bad attitude.

"
10 april 2019,aries,"It’s one thing to be a visionary; it’s another to be in fantasy land. Jupiter begins a four-month retrograde in your house of thinking big. This will demand more attention to detail and planning on your part. That said, by August 11th you could create a magnificent path ahead. Onward and upward!

"
11 april 2019,aries,"You will be inexplicably drawn to all things mysterious and hidden, Aries. With magnetic Venus and murky Neptune meeting up in the most confidential part of your chart, you’re going to be like Sherlock Holmes with a magnifying glass. You can also play the role of a sexy spy, so get the boudoir warmed up and ready to go.

"
12 april 2019,aries,"Stick to the facts today. Everyone may have an opinion, including you. But opinions mean nothing unless they are backed up by something solid. This may require some patience and you may have to do some digging. However, true knowledge is power.

"
13 april 2019,aries,"If there’s something about yourself—or your life—that you’ve been trying to change, you could feel a little stuck. That’s because the Sun is squaring Pluto, planet of transformation. Don’t worry–this energy changes quickly, tomorrow in fact.

"
14 april 2019,aries,"Feeling gutsy and bold? You should be! Four  celestial orbs are pushing you to expand. This is no time to be timid. Nor should you listen to naysayers who will put down your ideas.  You’ve got what it takes, Aries, so let it rip.

"
15 april 2019,aries,"This is no time to kid yourself about any aspect of your life, Aries. Take off the rose colored glasses and be brutally honest with yourself. With shrewd Mercury entering your sign on Wednesday, you’ll be able to see things with crystal clear vision.

"
16 april 2019,aries,"Moody blues! A Moon-Neptune opposition could make you WAY too emotional. Even if you’re as cool as can be, others may be dripping with drama. Fortunately this energy is over by tomorrow.

"
17 april 2019,aries,"Talk much? You will be now that chatty Mercury is in your sign! But this aspect will also help you dazzle people with your image and personality. You’ve got the whole package, so don’t be afraid to work it, ram.

"
18 april 2019,aries,"You may feel that no matter what you do, nobody is happy. A Moon-Saturn square could bring out the critical side of people. But do you really care? Probably not! With practical Mercury in your sign, you understand that this is their problem, not yours.

"
19 april 2019,aries,"Hmmmm….you may need to adjust the way you communicate with people in your world, Aries. A full moon occurs in your house of partnering, and it demands some reflection on your part. Are you a team player? Or are you doing all of the giving while others take?  Be honest with yourself.

"
20 april 2019,aries,"The Sun leaves your sign today, but this is no cause for sadness. That’s because El Sol is now in your house of earning and saving more money! Besides, glamorous, amorous Venus glides into Aries, which means that the spotlight is still on you. The next three weeks are excellent for a makeover.

"
21 april 2019,aries,"The Sun is now in solid Taurus, which is a grounded sign. But you’re feeling a bit adventurous and there’s nothing wrong with that. Are other people going to be pleased with your sunny new attitude? Maybe not, but that’s not going to stop you.

"
22 april 2019,aries,"Thomas Edison, when asked about how he came up with so many inventions, said that “ideas are in the air.” He was acknowledging that inspiration from the cosmos is out there and we can tap into it. Pay attention to your thoughts, as an amazing Sun-Uranus aspect could bring you a money-making idea today and tomorrow.

"
23 april 2019,aries,"Adventure is calling your name, but can you afford to go off and do something spontaneous? As long as it doesn’t cost too much, or take time away from your ambitions. With so much energy in your success sector, you have to balance risk with reward.

"

"
26 april 2019,aries,"People around you could be acting out, making you feel unsettled. The best thing that you can do is to remain unmoved, silent even. There could be more drama over the next few days, so let it unfold.

"
27 april 2019,aries,"With megamouth Mars in your communicating sector, no doubt you feel perfectly entitled to voice your opinion. The problem is that a difficult Neptune aspect indicates that others may not be as straightforward. This means that you could spill a lot, but they won’t…..and knowledge is power, which they will end up possessing. Be more strategic, Aries.

"
28 april 2019,aries,"It’s not your karma in life to suffer in a job or field that isn’t right for you. A Saturn-North Node opposition could make you feel a bit gloomy about your prospects, but not too worry. The ringed planet goes retrograde tomorrow, enabling you to come up with a Plan B.

"
29 april 2019,aries,"Slow mo’! Saturn starts to retrograde in your ambition sector, forcing you to slow down and ensure that you’re doing things right. Over the next few months your ideas and plans could change dramatically, for the better at that. But this doesn’t mean that you’ll be thinking small. On the contrary… the sky is the limit.

"
30 april 2019,aries,"A confusing Neptune-Mars square could be throwing off both your intuition and  the logical part of your brain. Needless to say, this is not a smart time to make decisions. Nor is it wise to blurt out what’s going on in that brain of yours, as you could be completely off. Silence is the best policy right now.

"
1 may 2019,aries,"You could sell ice cream to Eskimos under today’s fabulous aspects. So if you need to get a message out there, start hustling. Make the big ask. Crush it on social media. Flirt your little heart out. Not everyone will bite right away, but at least you’ve got the ball rolling.

"
2 may 2019,aries,"Ouch. Someone might try to pull a power play with you, and it could be a doozy. No matter how you try to be diplomatic, or how intelligent your argument might be, it won’t matter. Big egos don’t like to be shot down, do they? This might be one situation that it’s smarter to walk away from.

"
3 may 2019,aries,"Your sign is famous for being intrepid and you are going to live up to that reputation today! A wonderful Mercury-Jupiter trine allows you to strike off bravely in the direction of your choice. You won’t be looking back, either. Good for you.

"
4 may 2019,aries,"A new Moon occurs in your house of money, ram. This is one of the best times in 2019 to start earning more and saving more. But if you have big dreams that cost money, it’s critical to be conservative in your approach. A Mars-Jupiter opposition warns against diving into expensive ventures too quickly.

"
5 may 2019,aries,"People could be blustering and bloviating, and your tolerance for their BS will be pretty low. Before you lash out take a deep breath and count to ten. This battle probably isn’t worth it. Let them take their inflated egos somewhere else.

"
6 may 2019,aries,"The road ahead becomes clearer now that Mercury is in your regulated, stable second house. You are in an awesome position to create security in all areas of your life: emotional, financial, romantic, health, you name it. Needless to say this will require creating better habits and routines, but with Venus in Aries, this should be easy.

"
7 may 2019,aries,"This is not a day to bend the rules, Aries. Stern Saturn is in a tough ass mood, demanding that everything be done the right way. You might even feel overwhelmed by people or situations. The best thing you can do is to chill out and meditate, because Neptune is active in the house of your subconscious mind.

"
8 may 2019,aries,"Woo-hoo! Two of the brainiest planets in the solar system, Mercury and Uranus, meet up in the heavens. In your case, Aries, they connect in your house of making more money. You could uncover a genius idea for a product or service that could make you wealthy. It’s also an auspicious day for landing a higher paying gig. Pay close attention to your thoughts and dream state as your intuition is high.

"
9 may 2019,aries,"You’re feeling feisty and independent… good for you! A terrific Venus-Jupiter trine lifts you up. But not everyone wants to see you soar like an eagle. You know what to do with people like this: ignore them or dump them. The end.

"
10 may 2019,aries,"An internal battle may be brewing as you can’t decide whether to come on strong or back down. You know what they say: “you have to know when to hold ’em, and know when to fold ’em.” Don’t worry, this energy passes quickly. By tomorrow you’ll be able to see things more clearly.

"
11 may 2019,aries,"From your chart it’s looking like you’re craving more structure in your life, which isn’t such a bad thing. You also wants answers and commitments, so if you need to approach somebody, today is a good time to do so. Next Tuesday also works.

"
12 may 2019,aries,"The Moon is in flirtatious Leo, telling you to forget about your responsibilities and just have some fun. It winks at Venus in the house of adventure, all the more reason to take the day off and play. You have a lot of planetary energy later this week focused on career, so chill our and recharge your batteries.

"
13 may 2019,aries,"Gotta love it when the two of the most authoritative orbs in the solar system–Pluto and the Sun–are having a bromance. They are in your houses of mo’ money and crushing it in your career, so you are in an awesome spot for making progress. It’s time to step up and take charge of your life rather than waiting for things to fall into your lap.

"
14 may 2019,aries,"“You don’t ask, you don’t get.” That’s an old saying thrown around by salespeople and it really is true. A terrific Mars-Venus aspect tells you to ask for what you want: the date, the job, the raise, the wedding ring, the vacation, whatever floats your boat. Don’t assume that everyone is reading your mind.

"
15 may 2019,aries,"Big day in the cosmos! Venus enters your house of earning more money, while Mars zips into the domestic sector. This is good news for those rams who are saving for a house or a remodeling project. These sectors also deal with stability and contentment, so finding peace within close relationships will become more important to you.

"
16 may 2019,aries,"You’re as serious as a heart attack and people will be paying attention to your words. As a result, get important messages out there. Mature, logical Saturn has your back, and verbal Mercury does too. Whether you’re talking things over with a lover or promoting your brand, now’s the time to sat your piece.

"
17 may 2019,aries,"Curb your enthusiasm? You may need to temper your words and actions, Aries. A Mercury-Jupiter aspect indicates that you should slow down, promise less and be more attentive to details. A slowdown is not the same as quitting. Keep on moving forward, but be more observant in the process.

"
18 may 2019,aries,"The Scorpio full moon is a winner for scoring big, as in Big Money. It falls in your house of net worth, and a fantastic Mercury-Pluto trine could help bring in a raise, new job or higher revenues if you’re self-employed. Pay close attention to your intuition too, since Uranus (the planet of genius ideas) is active in your income sector.

"
19 may 2019,aries,"Life is about to become a lot more lively with the Sun and Mercury moving into one of the most social parts of your chart tomorrow. Today you need to wrap up financial negotiations, especially the kind that leads to a raise or new job. The next few weeks are excellent for promoting yourself and brainstorming with other people.

"
20 may 2019,aries,"A Moon-Jupiter connection spurs your desire to try new things. But murky Neptune could be making you see too many shiny, bright things. Try to narrow your choices down to just a few and take things one step at a team.

"
21 may 2019,aries,"Can we TALK?! Egads, not only does the Sun enter chatty Gemini, so does verbal Mercury. Honey, you are in an awesome position to get the word out over the next few weeks, whatever that means to you! You can crush it on social media. Flirt like no one’s business. Negotiate like a Fortune 500 exec. It’s also a super time for all Aries artists and creatives to shine.

"
22 may 2019,aries,"A money-making idea could hit you today and it could be pure genius. Better yet, it won’t be off-the-wall crazy either. Home based businesses are especially favored right now, so consider a side hustle or full-time domestic gig.

"
23 may 2019,aries,"If anyone tries to put you down or hold you back, I wish them a lot of luck! People may try to use guilt to get to you. Or perhaps they’ll try to make you think that you can’t pull something off. But they’re wrong, and you know it!

"
24 may 2019,aries,"They say that money talks, and right now it may be talking too much. Don’t get caught up in materialistic pursuits, ram. Trying to keep up with others or judging people by their bank account is not the way to go. And if you’re surrounded by people who are doing this, it may be time for some new friends.

"
25 may 2019,aries,"It’s Memorial Day weekend in the US and the planets want you to have a good time! Kick off the beginning of summer with the tribe. Plan some adventures. With happy-go-lucky Jupiter in your house of living la vida loca, you DESERVE to have some fun!

"
26 may 2019,aries,"Talking things over with someone is a better use of your time than simmering in resentment. It’s also better than arguing. You need to reduce drama, not perpetuate it or increase it. Namaste.

"
27 may 2019,aries,"“Slow down, you move too fast. Got to make the morning last! Just kicking down the cobblestones, looking for fun and feeling groovy.” You may be too young to remember this song, but the word “groovy” ought to tip you off that it’s from the 60s. A wonderful Moon-Neptune aspect today recommends that you kick back, relax and have some fun.

"
28 may 2019,aries,"Following the rules may make you feel safe. After all, we don’t always want to stand out or appear to be a rebel. But deep inside you may realize that you don’t want to do things the same way as everyone else. You don’t have to! But today’s not a smart time to make a big proclamation about it. Do your own thing behind the scenes.

"
29 may 2019,aries,"Shut yo’ mouf! Yeah, it’s a good day to keep things on the downlow. Chatty Mercury squares deceptive Neptune, which just happens to be in the house of confidentiality. Unless you want to make a total fool of yourself, or reveal state secrets to the enemy, you need to zip it. Tight.

"
30 may 2019,aries,"Don’t make promises you can’t keep, babe! And watch out for people who could do the same to you. They may not mean any harm, but overoptimistic Jupiter could be sprinkling star dust in their eyes. Tomorrow is a better time to get a clear picture as to what’s going on.

"
31 may 2019,aries,"The weekend starts off with a sizzle thanks to amorous Neptune and Venus forming a trine! Not only will these two help you find or enhance love, they can also inspire you to increase your cash flow. If you’ve been considering a job change or entering a new field, this is a good time to do some research.

"
1 june 2019,aries,"June begins with a request from the cosmos to balance practicality with taking chances! You’re in an awesome spot to shake things up, but making big changes without thinking them through is just foolish. Relying on gut hunches is not advised right now either. Think things through with the lest side of your brain.

"
2 june 2019,aries,"You know what you want and you’re not afraid to ask for it. So go ahead and be vocal! Considering that tomorrow’s new moon occurs in your house of communicating, the next two weeks are perfect for expressing yourself.

"
3 june 2019,aries,"The Gemini new Moon helps to put thoughts into words. Practical Saturn is well aspected to this lunation, ensuring that you’ll be thinking logically. As a result you’ll be able to make progress. Just don’t expect everyone else to be as forthright as you are, however. A wonky Neptune aspect could create confusion.

"
4 june 2019,aries,"There may be plenty of people trying to tell you what you should do, but that doesn’t mean that you have to listen to them. As a matter of fact, now that logical Mercury is in your house inner comfort, you’re not going to let anyone disrupt the flow of your precious chi.  Keep calm and carry on.

"
6 june 2019,aries,"Jangled nerves, stress and discontent start to ease up as gentle Venus is active in your house of stability. Pull away from known divas and a**holes if at all possible. You need a break from the crazy world, ram. Take it.

"
7 june 2019,aries,"Be open with people today and tomorrow. Too many tense emotions have been building up, and you need to release them. Do this before Sunday, though, as the cosmic skies get cloudy then.

"
11 june 2019,aries,"Sunny optimism works some days, but today is all about being realistic.You can’t afford to use hope and a prayer, as lovely as that sounds. The fiery Sun opposes Jupiter, demanding that logic rules. This theme runs through your chart all the way through the full moon on the 17th, so remain focused.

"
12 june 2019,aries,"In Italian families there is often a person who becomes the consigliere, whether they like it or not. This is the name for someone who gets stuck doing all of the hand holding, the peace making and problem solving. It’s usually a thankless job! So if your family (or friends) view you as the go-to person when the sh** hits the fan, then maybe it’s time to drop this role.

"
13 june 2019,aries,"Tone things down a little, ram. Your sign is well known for being direct but right now you need to be a bit more diplomatic. Don’t worry, you won’t be perceived as being weak!

"
14 june 2019,aries,"Flattery will get you everywhere today; being straightforward will not. You’re such an independent, confident sign that you tend to tell it like it is. Not today, ram! Let your talent shine too. People will be impressed by your skills and eloquence.

"
15 june 2019,aries,"You’re always so understanding of other people’s needs; now it’s your turn. A lunar aspect urges you to say what’s on your mind. This is especially true with family and a lover. Otherwise tension will build and reach critical mass, most likely by the middle of next week.

"
16 june 2019,aries,"This is a good day to go with the flow rather than following a typical routine. You’re in an intuitive place, so use your sixth sense to your advantage. People may criticize you for being so vibey instead of rational, but what do they know? Unless they’re an Aries too, they’re in the dark.

"
17 june 2019,aries,"The Sagittarius full moon could bring an audacious plan to a successful finale! And if you haven’t been working on anything that’s adventurous, it’s a good time to start. From your chart it appears that you’re growing tired of being hemmed in. Carpe diem.

"
18 june 2019,aries,"Determination sets in as a strong Saturn aspect fires up your resolve. Love, career, money matters: you want things done and you want them done now. But what’s nice is that there is a sense of ease with this, a knowingness that things will work out well.

"
19 june 2019,aries,"Ugh. A standoff between Mars and Pluto is going to bring out egos and tempers. Authority figures or systems (like a government agency) could be difficult to deal with. It’s up to you as to whether you should engage in this battle or not. If you can, wait until Friday to deal with these people.

"
21 june 2019,aries,"Big day in the cosmos! The Sun enters Cancer, your domestic sector, and Neptune starts to retrograde. Over the next few weeks some old childhood dramas and family dynamics could come back, if just in your mind. It’s important to work through these issues now. A solar eclipse occurs here on July 3rd, and it gives you the opportunity to move ahead with a lighter heart.

"
22 june 2019,aries,"Don’t be so emo! This could be tough to do with the Moon in the most sensitive part of your chart. Instead of letting your feelings take over, why not dig a little deeper and ask yourself what those emotions are trying to tell you.

"
23 june 2019,aries,"It’s one thing to be a visionary and another to be a bloody fool. People will be thinking larger than life today, but that doesn’t mean that they have a clue about what’s going on. Watch out for unrealistic thinking, not only on the part of others, but with yourself.
 

"
24 june 2019,aries,"You may appear confident on the outside, but inside is another story. With murky Neptune in a shaky spot in the most psychological part of your chart, you could be a bit emotional. A strong lunar aspect tomorrow helps you realize just how much you have going for you!

"
25 june 2019,aries,"Sometimes less is more, Aries. You’re better off taking on a few things and finishing them rather than too many and doing a half assed job. Mercury enters your talent sector tomorrow, so you will be in an excellent place to lavish your skills on a few important choices.

"
26 june 2019,aries,"How sweet it is! Lively Mercury zips into your house of romance, shopping, dining out and having fun. Take this energy and run with it before Mercury goes retrograde on July 7th. The pace may slow down a little bit between then and the 19th.

"
27 june 2019,aries,"Something unusual could happen today, something that will bring you greater peace of mind. Maybe it’s a raise or a job offer. Perhaps a family or romantic situation gets resolved to your liking. The next three days are all well aspected for creating more stability in your life.

"
28 june 2019,aries,"You’re playing for keeps, something that people are going to start to realize about you. Logical Saturn is guiding you in your long term decision making. This is important, as two eclipses in July will bring about massive changes in your career and home environment.

"
29 june 2019,aries,"You are so used to being direct and honest that sometimes you forget that a little bit of charm go a long way. A sweet lunar aspect can help you speak or write the kind of words that will impress and cajole others. Go back to being an obstinate ram another day!

"
30 june 2019,aries,"People may try to talk you out of doing something that you desire. The question is: should you listen to them? Maybe they’re jealous and don’t want to see you succeed. Or maybe they have your back, but they have a limited view as to what is possible. Don’t give up your dreams that easily. Stand up for what you want!

"
1 july 2019,aries,"Red hot Mars enters your romance zone, turning up the heat and spice factor! New love can be found. Existing relationships can take a dramatic, sexy turn. Just make sure that you aren’t so bogged down in home and caree5r matters that you don’t have time to enjoy this delicious energy.

"
2 july 2019,aries,"Work, work, work. It may seem that you just can’t get away from it. Pay close attention, Aries, because tomorrow’s solar eclipse may make you choose between your personal life and your professional one. If a boss (or your own business) is sucking you dry, some changes need to be made, stat.

"
3 july 2019,aries,"The focus is on your nearest and dearest as a solar eclipse occurs in Cancer, your domestic sector. The urge to nest and spend more time with loved ones will increase as gentle Venus enters this house today also. However, work demands may be pressing on you, and you may have some hard choices to make. If a job or other big goal is taking too much away from your personal life, it’s time to do some thinking.

"
4 july 2019,aries,"Some tough decisions need to be made about your personal life and your career. This is going to require an open mind. The ability to recognize new possibilities is the key, so don’t get stuck in a traditional groove. Let other people play by the rules or do things to keep people happy. You need to go your own way.

"
5 july 2019,aries,"The Moon, Jupiter and Neptune form a happy triangle in the heavens, encouraging you to live life a little bolder. This not only includes the “outside”–your appearance or the activities you take part of–but your inner world as well. Why not study a new philosophy or concept, such as Zen or mindfulness?

"
6 july 2019,aries,"The Virgo Moon sets up a sporty kind of a day. So go ahead, work that body! Swim, hike, play tennis or golf, or go to the gym and take a class. Then make this a habit, because you’re going to need vibrant health. An eclipse in the most ambitious part of your chart occurs on the 16th, and it’s going to be intense.

"
7 july 2019,aries,"Egads! Mercury goes retrograde in your house of romance. Between now and the 19th you need to watch what you say (and text) to a lover. Old issues could come back, needing to be dealt with. Don’t forget that red hot Mars is in this sector too, which could amp up drama. Oh….and I would be remiss if I didn’t tell you that old lovers could come slithering back too. Gird your loins.

"
8 july 2019,aries,"Changes need to be made at home and with your family, and this is a good time to do so. The Sun and Venus are both in this part of your chart, so you have cosmic support. The key to handling these issues intelligently is to use logic, not emotions. Facts will win the day over feelings.

"
9 july 2019,aries,"People will be playing hard ball today, so get ready for stubbornness and attitudes. The fiery Sun opposes disciplined Saturn. This is NOT a good time to bend the rules, tell the boss to go f**k off, or get way too emotional in the wrong setting. Keep calm and carry on.

"
10 july 2019,aries,"Someone close may need a shoulder to cry on today. Or maybe they just need some advice. Be there for them, as you’ll be able to provide inspiration and balance.

"
11 july 2019,aries,"Emotions can get heated as the two cosmic hotheads, Mars and Uranus, square off against each other in the heavens. Someone could say or do something that will throw you off balance. Heck, even you might do something that’s out of character. Think before you react.

"
12 july 2019,aries,"It’s a great day to indulge in anything of a creative nature or a sports activity. Your need to grow mentally, and even though many people view hobbies and sports as something primarily done for relaxation, they can also expand your mind. Which is precisely why you should try a new technique or activity.

"
13 july 2019,aries,"Your sign is never shy about taking on an adventure or new challenge! That’s why today’s Moon-Jupiter meet-up is custom made for your intrepid sign. Go ahead, take a risk of some kind. The areas of love and creativity are the best place to shake things up, as is foreign travel.

"
14 july 2019,aries,"Last week a Sun-Saturn opposition placed your needs against those of a job or a person who may be demanding that things be done their way. Well, here we go again: today the Sun opposes Pluto, and it’s the same kind of tense energy. Fortunately the upcoming lunar eclipse (on Tuesday) puts you in the driver’s seat, so don’t get all emo. Have the last laugh instead.

"
15 july 2019,aries,"Good heavens, are you motivated! The Moon swings past Saturn and Pluto in the most ambitious part of your chart. Nothing is going to stop you, and tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in this sector will make that clear to everyone–including the trolls and wannabes.

"
16 july 2019,aries,"Ladies and gentlemen, a drumroll please…..a lunar eclipse is occurring in Capricorn, your house of ambition. Something that you’ve been working hard on will come to pass, ram, probably within the next two to four weeks. Truth be told, not everyone is going to be thrilled with your success but that’s their problem. Get ready to take a bow.

"
17 july 2019,aries,"“I wanted it yesterday!”  That may be your attitude thanks to a tough Venus-Saturn opposition. Yesterday’s eclipse has gotten you all fired up to chase after your dreams, which is a good thing. But getting pushy about it and expecting immediate results is not. Chill out. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

"
18 july 2019,aries,"Yum! A lovely meeting of the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, creates a romantic mood. But this aspect also bodes well for inspiring creativity. Feeling better about yourself is possible too, as there is a nice healing vibe going on.

"
19 july 2019,aries,"Making peace with loved ones becomes a simpler task now that verbal Mercury is in Cancer. There has been some tense energy all month in this department, but you’re now entering into a much more peaceful phase. And a friskier one, too—-the Sun enters Leo, your house of having fun, on Monday!

"
20 july 2019,aries,"“Things cannot remain in stillness forever”, says Taoist author Deng Ming Dao. “Storms may destroy some things, but they also prepare the way for life…there must be an opportunity for new things to emerge and begin their own cycle.” That’s the message that the cosmos has for you as a number of planets are engaged in a standoff in the heavens. Pluto, planet of transformation, wants you to move on, but you’re holding back. It’s time to let go.

"
21 july 2019,aries,"People aren’t mind readers, so stop expecting them to know what’s going on in that head of yours. A productive Sun-Mercury aspect helps you communicate with people who count, especially family members and a lover. It’s time to put home and family matters to rest anyway, as the Sun is leaving this part of your chart tomorrow.

"
22 july 2019,aries,"Woo-hoo!! The Sun enters Leo, the most fun loving part of your chart. It’s officially time to shop for swag, dine out, attend concerts and go to the movies. Romance gets a big boost also, so plan some amorous date nights and weekends with your honey. Single and looking? Venus enters this sector on Saturday, so it will become easier to find a mate.

"
23 july 2019,aries,"You’ve got it going ON, Aries. Seriously–with the Moon in your sign winking at charismatic Mars, you are practically glowing. Nothing wrong with that either, as you will attract people who want to get to know you better. This could be a potential romantic partner, but it could also be a new BFF or industry connection.

"
24 july 2019,aries,"You’ve never been someone to hold back when it comes to chasing after a dream. But sometimes you just have to wait for the right cosmic energy to be in place to do so. Well Aries, a terrific Mercury-Venus link opens up doors. Get ready to walk through them.

"
25 july 2019,aries,"Over the next few days it may feel as though a big burden has been removed from your life. Has it really, or is it a positive shift in your attitude? Who cares! What matters is that optimism is returning thanks to abundant Jupiter in a good spot. This energy will increase through August 11th, at which time you’ll feel even more jazzed.

"
26 july 2019,aries,"Curb your enthusiasm? You may need to tone things down a bit. Being flamboyant or too confident about your abilities and personality could rub people the wrong way. Don’t worry, this doesn’t last long. In 24 hours glamorous Venus enters your house of drama and creativity, at which time you can let it rip!

"
27 july 2019,aries,"Ggrrrr!! Magnetic Venus glides into sultry Leo, catching up with her cosmic lover, Mars. The entire Leo season could be full of fun, flirting and amorous adventures. The new moon arriving on August 1st opens up a fresh chapter in love, and also your creativity. Develop your talents and show them off!

"
28 july 2019,aries,"Stop settling, Aries. That’s the message from Chiron, the Wounded Healer. You deserve a fabulous love life. You need more time off for personal pursuits, like hobbies or going out on the town. But you’ll never have these things if you don’t make the effort!

"
29 july 2019,aries,"Sometimes in life we beat ourselves up, saying, “Oh, I don’t have the talent to do that” (whatever “that” may be). Other times we think we have what it takes to do something, but we really don’t! Today’s cosmic energy demands that you take a realistic view about your habits, beliefs or skill level. It’s no big deal if you need to improve; accept it and then do what it takes to move ahead.

"
30 july 2019,aries,"The old adage about being the iron hand in the velvet glove applies to you today, Aries. If you need to demonstrate strength you’re better off doing it with charm and eloquence rather than blunt force. This is not your typical MO but hey, sometimes ya just gotta butter people up.

"
31 july 2019,aries,"Finally. Your family, lover, roommate or landlord may get off your back! Mercury is now direct in your domestic sector, helping you iron out residential and personality issues. From now through August 11th you should do whatever it takes to settle down this part of your life.

"
1 august 2019,aries,"Rawr! A sizzling new moon occurs in Leo, your house of romance. You now have the cosmos’ permission to be a flirtatious as you want, and if that means having a fling, so be it. Of course you can indulge in a more serious romantic encounter, which many rams will take advantage of. But issues about security could arise, especially the financial kind. Make sure that love is not blinding you to a lack of dinero.

"
2 august 2019,aries,"Don’t be so emo! A Venus-Uranus square could set off some major sensitivity to what others say and do. This could throw you off balance, making you think that things are worse than they actually are. Relax. Once the Moon changes signs tomorrow you’ll be in a far more practical place.

"
3 august 2019,aries,"The weekend is here and you’ll be in the mood for getting things done. Sure, you could use this energy to clean out the garage or balance your checkbook. But the cosmos calls for getting back into hobbies or sports that you may be neglecting. Is there a new activity you’d like to try? Then look into it and start, as next week is awesome for creative and physical outlets.

"
4 august 2019,aries,"Everyone has an opinion and a lot of them have a good point! All the more reason to pay attention to what others have to say. You are entering into one of the most mind expanding weeks you’ve had in a long time. Don’t be too proud to admit that there are savvier people out there. Soak up their wisdom.

"
5 august 2019,aries,"The Libra Moon is helping you to play nice with others, a situation that isn’t always easy for your independent sign. Listen, you don’t have to agree with everything they say and do. Just be more tolerant. There could be a surprise payoff down the road for you if you do.

"
6 august 2019,aries,"Do you want to make money or lose it? A Moon-Uranus opposition could make you operate with emotions and haste, never a good plan when it comes to finances. There are some stellar aspects ahead for earning more. Balance your bright ideas with some serious number crunching before you act.

"
7 august 2019,aries,"A fabulous Sun-Jupiter trine creates a level of optimism that you haven’t witnessed in ages, ram! Your creativity and talent are blossoming. Romance is poised to take an adventurous turn. If you feel as though the sky is the limit, you’re on the right track. And if you’re not there yet, you will be next week when Jupiter goes direct on Sunday.

"
8 august 2019,aries,"Romance sizzles with a delightful Venus-Jupiter trine! You should be feeling more adventurous, not only when it comes to love but in all areas of your life. Make a vow to do something out of the ordinary this week. Even if it has to be scheduled for some time in the near future, plan it now.

"
9 august 2019,aries,"It’s time to find a happy medium between thinking with your head and feeling with your heart. With so much planetary activity in dramatic Leo these days, you run the risk of running on pure emotions. Don’t forget that the grey matter between your ears has value too. That said, the mood is still dreamy!

"
10 august 2019,aries,"Is honesty always the best policy? You’re feeling charming and free spirited, thanks to all of the planetary action in vivacious Leo. But you run the risk of revealing too much…or maybe trusting the wrong person. Have all the fun you want, but keep some information under lock and key.

"
11 august 2019,aries,"Big day in the cosmos! Logical Mercury enters your romance sector, dialing down the drama (phew). Optimistic Jupiter goes direct in your house of adventure (yee-ha!) and Uranus starts to retrograde in your income house (keep an eye on cash flow). You’re going to want to take more chances, which is a good thing….as long as they don’t cost too much money.

"
12 august 2019,aries,"Despite all of the fun, flirty energy going on in your chart, today you mean business. A Moon-Saturn conjunction makes you both passionate and determined to see something through. Set your sights on something that’s important to you and remain focused as a laser beam.

"
13 august 2019,aries,"Trying to talk sense to someone who needs to hear it? Good luck with that. A Mercury-Moon opposition will make it difficult for people around you to think logically. The full moon on Thursday is the best time to make them wake up, so hold off until then if you can.

"
14 august 2019,aries,"Ggrrrr!!! Romantic Venus meets up with the fiery Sun in your house of romance, making for one steamy day. If you’re looking for love both online sites and matchmaking friends could work. This aspect is also super for creative projects, so dive in and make your mark.

"
15 august 2019,aries,"The Aquarius full moon focuses on the people in your world, the ones who truly count. Make sure that you’re spending time with the kind who appreciate and respect you. Frenemies, iffy lovers and people who bring too much drama to the table should be deleted. You’ve got too much going for you to put up with trolls and malcontents.

"
16 august 2019,aries,"Don’t let emotions cloud your judgment when it comes to money matters. Erratic Uranus is stirring stuff up in your cash sector, and it could be easy to respond with feelings rather than facts. Fortunately a slew of celestial orbs are about to enter practical Virgo, at which time you’ll be able to use more logic!

"
17 august 2019,aries,"It’s not your karma to work in a soul-sucking job for the rest of your life. Nor is it your destiny to put up with all sorts of crap from relatives or a lover. The North Node of the Moon opposes Saturn, letting you know that the time has come for living a happy, authentic life. When Mars and the Sun enter efficient Virgo next week, you’ll be able to make a lot of changes.

"
18 august 2019,aries,"Got the urge to purge? Energetic Mars is in Virgo, your sixth house of organization. Other orbs go there later this week, so don’t be surprised to find that you actually feel like cleaning the house and getting all caught up on errands! This also happens to be your fitness sector. Starting a new diet or exercise regimen is favored, especially this coming weekend. You will be surprisingly disciplined!

"
19 august 2019,aries,"It’s time to show the world just how dynamic and talented you truly are. A Moon-Mercury aspect helps you get the word out! Find a platform that works best for you. The upcoming Virgo season is incredibly productive for you, so start getting ready now. Fame and fortune come to those who hustle under these aspects.

"
20 august 2019,aries,"Do you work for the police or fire department? Do you rescue people for a living? No? Then why are you trying to help someone who clearly needs to figure something out for themselves! Sometimes the best way to assist someone is to let them make a mistake and learn from it. It’s called tough love and it often works.

"
21 august 2019,aries,"“The way a person does one thing is the way they do everything.” You’ve probably heard that quote before, and it applies to you right now! It’s time to do things in a far more interesting way, and this includes the small things. Be fussy. Be particular. Give everything that added dollop of pizzazz. Make life more interesting!

"
22 august 2019,aries,"Doubts may start creeping in, throwing you off balance. But is there any substance to them? Probably not! This is one of the best times of year for you. Enjoying the sweeter side of life is what it’s all about. Stop worrying about things that aren’t true problems.

"
23 august 2019,aries,"Reality starts to set in as the Sun enters practical Virgo! You’ll be even more motivated than usual to get a grip on your personal and professional lives. This year Mars and Venus are also in this organized sign, and logical Mercury arrives soon. The upside is that your health, career and finances can all benefit from your hard work.

"
24 august 2019,aries,"Your motivation rises to get into superb physical condition as gorgeous Venus meets up with energetic Mars. Find an exercise buddy to work out with. Involved in a romantic relationship? The couple that plays together stays together, so make a pact with your lover to get healthy together. Besides, think of all the energy you’ll have for “other stuff.”

"
25 august 2019,aries,"You’re a tough ram and frequently push yourself hard. But why? Is it all due to your astrological sign, or is there also something from childhood that makes you so gung ho? A Mars-Chiron aspect suggests that you slow your pace down a bit. You weren’t out on this planet to be a work machine. Stop and smell the flowers, Aries.

"
26 august 2019,aries,"Assistance could come from a surprising source, so be open to people who want to help. The same goes for new technology or better hacks that will make your life so much easier. It’s also a good time to hire or retain someone, such as a housekeeper or virtual assistant. Stop trying to do it all on your own.

"
27 august 2019,aries,"Someone might come on strong today, too strong for your taste. And with the moon in one of the most sensitive parts of your chart you could easily get annoyed. This cosmic aspect passes quickly; it’s gone by tomorrow. Besides, some interesting events could occur that put you in the driver’s seat.

"
28 august 2019,aries,"Enthusiasm soars as Uranus cranks up your energy level! You’ll be operating at warp speed all week, but that’s OK with you. The realization is starting to hit you that you’re capable of more than you had previously thought. People around you will end up in shock, but hey, that’s part of the fun, isn’t it?
 
 

"
29 august 2019,aries,"Chatty, intelligent Mercury enters your house of getting things done and nothing is going to get in your way! That said, people may actually be more cooperative than usual, so don’t try to do everything on your own. (This includes love too.) Over the next two weeks you can make a lot of progress, either with people…or without them.

"
30 august 2019,aries,"The Virgo new moon is all about living with less stress. But in order to do that you need to get your life together–your work flow at the office, personal vitality and fitness, being caught up on errands and generally not feeling like you’re always up against a deadline. Slacker Neptune opposes the new moon though, whispering in your ear that you should stick to doing things the same old way. Wrong. Make the necessary changes.

"
31 august 2019,aries,"Sometimes you just have to get out of your way and let things be. The harder we try to force things, it seems, the more they slip away—and the more frustrated we get. Today’s lunar energy recommends just chilling out and being passive, which ain’t easy for a hard-charging ram like you!

"
1 september 2019,aries,"Changes are coming and they’re good! You might be a bit surprised by what happens at home and at work, but you’ll be pleased with the end result.

"
4 may 2019,taurus,"Woo-hoo! The annual new moon in Taurus takes place. This is the best time all year to launch initiatives that are important to you.

5 may 2019,taurus,"Red hot Mars is tearing through your money house….which means that you can be burning through cash.

20 may 2019,taurus,"Follow your gut today, and your emotions too. Your friends and other people may try to tell you to go a different route, but your own wisdom is best. Tuesday is super for gaining more clarity, because spunky Mars is active in your house of thinking.

"
21 may 2019,taurus,"Cha-ching! Ah, the luscious sound of the cash register ringing, a sound near and dear to the Taurus heart. You love money and it loves you, and right now you can score more of it. Not only has the Sun entered Gemini, your income sector, but so has shrewd Mercury. Over the next month you can make enormous strides when it comes to increasing your cash flow.

"
22 may 2019,taurus,"You are an absolute force of nature today, thanks to a Mars-Uranus meet up. Uranus is the planet of brilliant ideas and it acts quickly, which means that you could do a complete 180 degree turn. So don’t be surprised if you decide to change your life’s path in a heartbeat and swiftly move on to something new.

"
23 may 2019,taurus,"You know how people say “you have to fake it til you make it’? What they mean, of course, is that sometimes you have to play the role of the person you want to be in the future, even if your circumstances right now aren’t exactly to your liking. It might feel a bit awkward but you should give it a try.

"
24 may 2019,taurus,"Gentle Venus is in your sign, perhaps making you more forgiving than usual. Don’t be too quick to cut people slack, Taurus. They may take advantage of it. There’s nothing wrong with holding people to high standards.

"
25 may 2019,taurus,"You need some guarantees these days, especially when it comes to love and money. A happy Jupiter-Moon aspect will help you get answers to some of the questions that are burning in your mind. Sunday is well aspected for digging deep, so the cosmos is working in your favor.

"
26 may 2019,taurus,"According to your chart, you seem to be a bit unfocused. Perhaps you have too much on your plate. Or maybe your mind is consumed with fears and stress. It’s time to clear out the mental cobwebs and focus like a laser beam. This will mean cutting out distractions, including some people, but it has to be done.

"
27 may 2019,taurus,"If you need help, don’t feel shy about asking for favors. Friends, colleagues or mentors will be happy to help you. From your chart it appears that you have always been there for them. Now it’s your turn to cash in.

"
28 may 2019,taurus,"This may sound a bit cold, Taurus, but not everyone deserves to be in your life. This goes for friends, colleagues and team members. It could even apply to your family and a lover. If anyone is bringing too much drama and stress into your life, it may be time to pull away a bit.

"
29 may 2019,taurus,"You know that sappy saying, “there is no ‘I’ in the word ‘team’ “? Well, try telling that to other people today! Let’s just say that cooperation will be hard to come by, so don’t expect it. You may need to be the voice of reason in a group effort, but if people are slacking off too much, then wait until tomorrow. The energy is much better then.

"
30 may 2019,taurus,"Hide the credit cards. Avoid Amazon and Ebay. Car showrooms? Don’t even think about it. The same goes for luxury boutiques and swanky online shopping sites. A Mercury-Jupiter opposition warns that your eyes will be bigger than your wallet. Overspending is a real possibility, so it’s Target and McDonald’s for you, my friend. Hold the fries.

"
31 may 2019,taurus,"With va-va-va-voom Venus in your sign, you can attract people to you like moths to a flame. Naturally this could mean a new lover, but everyone is going to want to bask in your glow. This is looking like one heck of a social weekend, so put on some gorgeous clothes and head out the door. Your public is waiting for you, dahling.

"
1 june 2019,taurus,"Just what exactly IS charisma, anyway? People who exude magnetism don’t necessarily have the same kinds of charm. Audrey Hepburn’s charisma was way different than, say, Marilyn Monroe’s. Obama’s appeal is nothing like Brad Cooper’s. With charming Venus in your sign, it’s time to think about the message you’re sending out, and how to improve it.

"
2 june 2019,taurus,"You know what you want, and the good thing is that nothing is going to get in your way. Does that mean that there will be no roadblocks, no obstacles to get past? Hell no! They will be there. You simply won’t care, that’s all. And that’s a beautiful place to be.

"
3 june 2019,taurus,"Yeah, baby! Today’s sparkling new Moon occurs in your house of earning and saving more money. A terrific Pluto-Saturn-Venus aspect encourages you to take some chances, such as changing fields or maybe even starting your own business. But make sure to follow your own wisdom. Friends, colleagues and family members could get a little jealous and give you advice that isn’t solid.

"
4 june 2019,taurus,"Chatty Mercury enters your house of communication, opening up the floodgates! You are going to have a lot to say over the next few weeks, that’s for sure. This could be one of the best times in 2019 to brainstorm and network with other people. It also rocks for partying and flirting, I might add. Have fun!

"
5 june 2019,taurus,"Words can cut like a knife or they can heal. The choice is yours. Do you want to go ballistic or be a peace maker? While you’re at it, consider the way you talk to yourself. Maybe you should be a bit kinder.

"
6 june 2019,taurus,"Venus spends another 48 hours in your sign, so make the most of it! If you’ve been thinking about updating your appearance with some new clothes and a different hairstyle, then go for it. In astrology what counts is when you start something. Even if it takes a few weeks or months to pull off a new look, the important thing is that you got it going when glamorous Venus was in Taurus.

"
7 june 2019,taurus,"Today is perfectly aspected for being spontaneous and doing whatever you want! Spunky Uranus is in your sign, telling you to forget your worries and responsibilities. If you can’t cut loose today then find some time over the weekend to have some fun.

"
11 june 2019,taurus,"A Sun-Jupiter opposition warns against taking on unnecessary debt or overspending. With optimistic Jupiter in your house of credit cards and net worth, you may think that you’ll have no problem whatsoever finding the money later on to pay the bills. Really? Stay conservative with your money through the 23rd.

"
12 june 2019,taurus,"Are you underselling yourself? Perhaps you think that you’re not as brainy or eloquent as others. Maybe you’re shy at get-togethers and lack confidence. It’s time to get rid of this ridiculous notion. When the Sun enters Cancer on the 21st you’ll start to realize that you have brains—just like the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz!

"
13 june 2019,taurus,"Breaking the rules can be fun sometimes. However, sticking to the tried and true also has its merits. Today you can find a balance between being edgy and playing it safe. Not everyone can pull this off, but you’ll figure out how to do it.

"
14 june 2019,taurus,"You may think you know what’s best but it would be wise to seek a second opinion. Even if a trusted individual tells you what you already know, it’s worth it to get the feedback. This energy continues into next week, so keep an open mind.

"
15 june 2019,taurus,"People may be trying to get their way by wearing you down, thinking that you have a soft side. Well, you DO have a tender heart but you’re nobody’s fool. Hold your ground too, as this energy goes into next week and reaches a crescendo on Wednesday, Give ’em an inch and they’ll take a mile, my friend.

"
16 june 2019,taurus,"You should only be listening to people who are 100% trustworthy, Taurus. They will aid and inspire you. They will point out fresh avenues for you to explore. Also, avoid the kind of people who want to do things the same old way, “because that’s how we’ve only done it.” You need to have your mind expanded, not restricted.

"
17 june 2019,taurus,"Its time to get serious about your finances, Taurus. Tonight’s full moon occurs in your net worth sector. Risk-adverse Saturn is warning against doing anything crazy, though. Like quitting the day job when you don’t have anything else lined up. Or putting money in speculative investments. Play it safe for now.

"
18 june 2019,taurus,"You can move mountains, as verbal Mercury meets up with assertive Mars in your communication sector. If you need to make a big ask or get your point across to someone, today is a good time to do so. Tomorrow and Thursday, not so much. Strike while the iron is hot.

"
19 june 2019,taurus,"People will be spouting all sorts of ideas today, and chances are they want you to buy into them. But with shrewd Mercury and assertive Mars in your house of quick thinking, you’ll be nobody’s fool. Just don’t tell them that, OK?

"
20 june 2019,taurus,"With unpredictable Uranus acting up in your sign, you might be tempted to do or say something unusual. The problem is that the Moon squares Uranus from your house of authority figures, which means that there could be some backlash. Do you really want to piss off a boss, client, cop, judge or government agency? Or someone close whose opinion means a lot to you? Be careful.

"
21 june 2019,taurus,"You’re known by the company you keep, Taurus. Two major planetary aspects will force you to examine your connections, both personal and business. First, Neptune retrogrades in your house of friends and colleagues. And the Sun enters Cancer, one of the most social parts of your chart. So over the next few weeks you could be in the presence of a lot of people, but are they the right ones for you?

"
22 june 2019,taurus,"What are your most closely held values, Taurus? With the Moon in your house of cherished thoughts, it’s important to give this some thought. A powerful lunar aspect next Tuesday will help you realize that your life is not predetermined in any way. You can  choose some new values!

"
23 june 2019,taurus,"Your emotions——and those of others— could be going all over the place, courtesy of a Venus-Jupiter opposition. One minute you may be feeling settled and practical, and the next you could be reeling from a jealous hissy fit. This energy continues into tomorrow so do your best to chill out!

"
24 june 2019,taurus,"Getting involved with a good cause will change not only the lives of other people, but also your own. You may not have a lot of time right now, but try to carve out just a little. Eventually you’ll be able to devote more attention to it. Just make sure that you get involved in an organized group, otherwise you’ll quickly lose interest.

"
25 june 2019,taurus,"Learn from your mistakes and move on, Taurus. With the Sun, Mercury and Mars all in the most thoughtful part of your chart you’ll be able to figure out how you went off track—-and how to avoid this in the future. You’re nobody’s fool and you won’t make the same mistakes twice.

"
26 june 2019,taurus,"Take care of home and family related matters now that logical Mercury is in your domestic sector. It’s important to jump on this immediately, as aspects in early July could heat things up. There will be an eclipse on the 3rd and Mercury starts to retrograde on the 7th. You’ve been warned!

"
27 june 2019,taurus,"What a winner of a day! With spunky Uranus active in your sign, you can impress the daylights out of everyone. Needless to say this energy is good for your career, so shamelessly plug yourself. Negotiate deals. Explain your brilliant ideas. But you can also flirt and party to your heart’s content too.

"
28 june 2019,taurus,"Some of your ideas may not be as crazy as you think, Taurus. So don’t listen to what other people have to say. Nor should you pay attention to that little voice of fear that wants to keep you trapped doing the same old thing. With the Moon in your sign your true passions will rise.

"
29 june 2019,taurus,"Making amends on the home front is possible thanks to a positive lunar aspect. The Moon is in Taurus, which will help you protect your own interests while still cooperating with others. People may be more agreeable than you’d expect.

"
30 june 2019,taurus,"Hard work pays off, something that you know all about. After all, you’re one of the most grounded signs of the zodiac! But a Moon-Saturn opposition may bring unrealistic expectations about what is possible. Don’t assume that everything is going to fall into place quickly and neatly; it may be more involved than that.

"
1 july 2019,taurus,"Home and family matters pick up momentum now that assertive Mars is in this part of your chart. Moving and redecorating could happen, along with starting a family of your own! Just don’t rush in, as Mercury will be going retrograde here from the 7th through the 19th.

"
2 july 2019,taurus,"Watch your words, oh raging bull. You like to tell it the way you see it but it’s not a good time for being so direct. Wait for smooth talking Venus to enter your house of communicating, which happens tomorrow!

"
3 july 2019,taurus,"The floodgates open as a sparkling solar eclipse occurs in your house of thinking, speaking and writing! Over the next six months you’ll be quite chatty and social. Fabulous ideas will come your way. The only thing to watch out for is being too opinionated, an issue with mature Saturn opposing this lunation.

"
4 july 2019,taurus,"Yesterday’s eclipse was designed to jostle your mind into new ways of thinking. Neurologists say that our brains tend to have repetitive thoughts because they create grooves, or neural pathways. They’re kind of like a path through the woods that remains clear because it is used so much. The good news from the scientific community is that these grooves can go buh-bye. It’s called “neural plasticity”, and today’s aspects encourage you to be open to that possibility.

"
5 july 2019,taurus,"Need to talk to someone? Then reach out to a trusted friend or family member. You’ve been carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders and it’s time to lessen that load. Someone else’s opinion could help you recognize options that you hadn’t even considered.

"
6 july 2019,taurus,"Give yourself permission to play! The Moon is in the most carefree part of your chart, so find a person to share good times with. It’s a great weekend for taking up a hobby or sport, or getting back to one that you used to enjoy. Life’s too short to be working and worrying all of the time.

"
7 july 2019,taurus,"How are things at home? Getting along with the family unit? I sure hope so, because Mercury starts to retrograde today in your domestic sector. Issues from the past could come back, demanding to be resolved. Fortunately this is short lived (it lasts through the 19th). You have a lot of planetary firepower in your communications zone, so don’t be shy about speaking up.

"
8 july 2019,taurus,"Don’t hold back! Say what’s in your mind and in your heart, even if you’re not sure that it’s the right thing to do. It is. Holding things in will only make things more difficult, so out with it already.

"
9 july 2019,taurus,"Talk is cheap, so make sure that your words count. Don’t make promises that you can’t keep. On the flip side, be wary of other people trying to get you to do things their way. This includes signing contracts or agreeing to some course of action. If possible, wait until Thursday before making key decisions.

"
10 july 2019,taurus,"Right now you have the ability to get along with everyone, even people who aren’t your type! This is a good thing because team work counts for a lot in the weeks ahead. The last thing you need are people trying to block your progress.

"
11 july 2019,taurus,"If anyone gives you a head time today, chances are you’re going to charge at them like a raging bull! Unpredictable Uranus is agitated, it’s in Taurus, and it doesn’t want to take any guff. The good news is that this passes by tomorrow.

"
12 july 2019,taurus,"Put your home life first this weekend, Taurus. Even if your family lives far away or you don’t have a Significant Other, at least spend some quality time on yourself. The next 48 hours are excellent for chilling out and doing some inner work on your psyche too.

"
13 july 2019,taurus,"Enough already! You’ve been carrying too much emotional baggage and it’s time to let it go. But just thinking happy thoughts and repeating affirmations isn’t going to work. You need to see yourself as a “bigger” person, too chill to even care about some of this nonsense. The eclipse on Tuesday will help you do that.

"
14 july 2019,taurus,"The opinionated bloviators will be out in force today, and it could be easy to get caught up in a war of words with them. But is it worth it? Probably not. With so much planetary energy circulating through your house of optimism and living large, you don’t have time for egotistical chumps.

"
15 july 2019,taurus,"The word “passion” conjures up so many things: excitement, desire, optimism and a willingness to try new things. You’ve got passion in spades today as the two most spirited orbs in the solar system–Jupiter and the Moon—meet up. Take this wonderful energy and run with it.

"
16 july 2019,taurus,"Yee-ha! A luscious lunar eclipse occurs in the most free wheeling part of your chart. If you’ve been pining to get any from restrictive circumstances, this is your moment. And if you’ve been working on something big… a manuscript, business launch, epic voyage, graduate degree…things are going to come together nicely.

"
17 july 2019,taurus,"You may feel like bending the rules. You could try to convince yourself that this is what visionaries do. The problem is, even the most creative thinkers and doers on the planet still need to operate within a system. Remember that and you’ll do fine.

"
18 july 2019,taurus,"Your powers of persuasion are off the charts, so use this to your advantage! You won’t have to be forceful either. Charm will work better than shows of strength. And all areas of your life can benefit–your romance, career, friendships and family relationships.

"
19 july 2019,taurus,"Life becomes a lot livelier now that chatty Mercury is in your house of expression and socializing. But old issues with close connections could come back, demanding to be resolved. If you need to talk things over with people, get it done between now and the 31st.

"
20 july 2019,taurus,"A battle may erupt as people think that their opinions are the only correct ones! Be wary about taking a “my way or the highway” approach. And if anyone tries to push you into following their agenda, back away as politely as possible.

"
21 july 2019,taurus,"This is one of the best times in 2019 to get your point across to someone who needs to hear it. The Sun meets up with Mercury in your communication sector, giving you the gift of gab. You could win people over in your personal life or make big splash in your professional one. Don’t hold back!

"
22 july 2019,taurus,"It’s high time that you spent some quality moments with loved ones….or even just alone be yourself, recharging your batteries! It will be easy to do now that the Sun is in Leo, the part of your chart that encourages you to nest. Over the next four weeks you could also make important decisions about where to live and with whom. Want to redecorate? Then wait til Saturday, when Venus–planet of beauty–enters this sector.

"
23 july 2019,taurus,"Your sensitivity to others’ needs—and your own–is heightened by a Moon-Mars connection. It’s a big-hearted energy, one that will help you find inner peace. People may need your assistance, so don’t hold back from helping them. You will be at the right place at the right time.

"
24 july 2019,taurus,"The lines of communication open wide, thanks to a happy Mercury-Venus aspect. With so many planets currently in your house of family, home and romance, you should make an effort to work things out with loved ones. But you can also use this energy to self-promote and socialize.

"
25 july 2019,taurus,"Passion may be overtaking your mind, making you wonder if you’re operating too much on emotions. You’re not! It’s due to a wonderful Mars-Jupiter trine. These orbs are activating the paths of your chart that enable you to dig deep into your psyche. It’s all about living life to the fullest and feeling content about it. Don’t be afraid to show the world how ardent you are.

"
26 july 2019,taurus,"You’re a grounded soul, not one to take unnecessary risks. But an interesting Mars-Saturn aspect helps you push just a teensy bit past your comfort zone, which is perfectly OK. As a matter of fact, it’s smart. Keep taking these baby steps one day at time. In a few months you’ll be in a different place and you’ll get there without crashing and burning.

"
27 july 2019,taurus,"The urge to nest at home gets even stronger now that Venus is in your domestic sector. Since this glittering orb governs beauty and comfort, it’s time to update your place. Even off you’re on a tight budget you should do what it takes to make home base serene and chic. Declutter, deep clean and decorate.

"
28 july 2019,taurus,"It’s perfectly OK to let out your emotions, Taurus! As a matter of fact, it’s essential that you do so right now. Chiron, the Wounded Healer, wants to bring your life into balance. The first place to start is with your psyche. Then work on relationships with your family. Career, health, money….they can wait a bit. Balance doesn’t happen  overnight.

"
29 july 2019,taurus,"Old childhood patterns and memories could come roaring back, the kind that get you worked up. While this may be annoying, it’s part of a healing process that your heart and soul are going through right now. Just let it wash through you. The cosmic skies are calmer tomorrow.

"
30 july 2019,taurus,"People may be expecting more from you than you’re willing to give. So carefully consider it if you’re asked to do more. You may need to set some boundaries, and people won’t hesitate to lay guilt on you. Remind them diplomatically that you need to take care of your own interests.

"
31 july 2019,taurus,"Say hallelujah, say amen. Mercury has gone direct in your communications sector, ending two plus weeks of gaffes and unclear messages. Your thinking should become clearer as well. Take this energy and run with it, because now you can negotiate, self promote and socialize like crazy!

"
1 august 2019,taurus,"The Leo new moon puts family and residential matters first…but are you on board with what’s going on? Disagreements could occur about where to live, or with whom. Family members could be butting into your personal business, especially the romantic kind. With fiery Uranus active in Taurus, you aren’t going to roll over and play dead, that’s for sure. Let others know that your opinion WILL be heard.

"
2 august 2019,taurus,"People are going to rub you the wrong way….but are they really doing anything wrong? Erratic Uranus is active in your sign, making you overly active to the outside world. Take a deep breath and count to ten before you say or do anything that you might regret. Tomorrow the Moon glides into the most playful part of your chart, so why not wait this out?

"
3 august 2019,taurus,"Oh yeah! The weekend is here and the Moon is in Virgo, your house of flirting and having fun. Take advantage of this light hearted energy. You’ve been working hard and you’ve earned some down time. As August progresses you’ll have your mind on more practical matters; all the more reason to play right now.

"
4 august 2019,taurus,"Change can come easy or it can come hard. It can happen fast or at a snail’s pace. With the two most obstinate planets–Mars and Pluto–trying to push you out of your comfort zone, you might expect a rough ride. These guys aren’t subtle; actually they’re usually quite forceful. But today they’re forming a bromance, so things will happen with greater ease.

"
5 august 2019,taurus,"Getting everyone in a group to work better as a team isn’t impossible, Taurus…but it will require some finessing on your part. That’s OK. Thanks to Jupiter in the most optimistic part of your chart, you’ll be able to point out the big picture to everyone.

"
6 august 2019,taurus,"With spunky Uranus active in your sign, you may feel as though you can do it all. But you can’t and you shouldn’t. Let others do their share and keep them in the loop. Besides, they’ll be able to provide you with sage advice when the time comes.

"
7 august 2019,taurus,"Your financial future gets a huge boost as abundant Jupiter high fives the Sun. The initiatives that you start today could have a powerful influence on your net worth down the road. Everyone will talk about how lucky you are, but you’ll know the truth—you made it happen through good old fashioned hard work.

"
8 august 2019,taurus,"Creating a warm, relaxing vibe at home is in the stars, Taurus. A lovely Venus-Sun aspect tells you to make your place a serene haven. But there’s only so much some new pillows and candles can do! You need peace and contentment at home, so do what’s necessary to reduce drama. Moving to another location, or cohabitating with a lover, is also well aspected right now.

"
9 august 2019,taurus,"You have a lot of energy: are you channeling it in the right direction? That’s the question asked by stern Saturn today. You’re actually in a good spot to try some things (and people!) and be happy and successful with them. But your thoughts seem to be going all over the place. Focus on what really floats your boat.

"
10 august 2019,taurus,"From your chart it appears that you’re willing to be more open minded about people who have a different point of view, and this is a good thing. Let’s face it….your stubbornness can be a liability sometimes! Accepting the opinions of others might make you a little twitchy at first, but you’ll get used to it. Not only that, you’ll learn from it too.

"
11 august 2019,taurus,"Aahhhh, the sweet feeling of comfort. You’re going to be experiencing it more often now that level headed Mercury has entered your house of home and family. Optimistic Jupiter is going direct today in one of the most emotional parts of your chart. And Uranus retrogrades in Taurus, something that will actually help you calm down and be less erratic. It’s all good.

"
12 august 2019,taurus,"You’ll be in El Toro mode today, and this is a good thing. The Moon and Saturn meet up in your house of pushing yourself past previous boundaries. Instead of feeling stuck, you’ll be pawing at the ground and look at the future like it’s a red flag! So charge ahead, brave bull. Thursday’s full moon could bring some interesting news that will show that you’re on the right track.

"
13 august 2019,taurus,"Anyone who tries to lay a guilt trip on you is in for a big surprise! You’re as motivated as hell, and nothing is going to get in your way. Could it be that others are afraid that you’ll fly too high, too fast? Probably. Oh well. You have no intention on staying stuck where you are.

"
14 august 2019,taurus,"Got a case of the #feels? It’s not surprising if you’re all warm and mushy and sentimental. The emotional Moon meets up with the Sun in your house of home, family and love. Reminiscing about the old times is a likely activity. But you could also create some lovely memories today, things you’ll cherish in the future.

"
15 august 2019,taurus,"It’s time to wrap up some things you’ve been working on, Taurus. Important stuff, the kind that takes your future in a new direction. A full moon occurs in your house of ambition, making this one of the best times in 2019 to solidify matters. Considering that unpredictable Uranus just went retrograde in your sign a few days ago, don’t be surprised if you chuck old ideas and replace them with new ones.

"
16 august 2019,taurus,"Don’t be so eager to get going with something that you throw your life off balance. Impatient Uranus is hopping up and down in Taurus, yelling “I want it now!”  Slow down there, El Toro. Otherwise you’ll end up with a lot of messes to clean up.

"
17 august 2019,taurus,"It may seem as though you are stuck, and heaven knows you are SO tired of it. Big dreams may appear to be off on a horizon that keeps moving further away. Don’t sweat it, Taurus. Life picks up steam next week and optimism returns. What you really need is a good dose of fun and relaxation. Then you’ll realize that some of this stuff is just in your head.

"
18 august 2019,taurus,"You’re entering into one of the lustiest, most flirtatious periods in a long time, Taurus! Red hot Mars enters Virgo, your fifth house of amour. You tend not to like change, but over the next four weeks you’ll be exposed to so many new people and ideas. Life is meant to be lived to the fullest, something that you will recognize. Being open minded about love is just one of the many benefits that you will enjoy.

"
19 august 2019,taurus,"Release pent-up emotions and frustration that have been accumulating, Taurus. Otherwise there won’t be any room in your head or your heart for love and enjoying life. A sweet Moon-Mercury aspect enables you to gently vent. Feeling comfortable in your own skin is what it’s all about.

"
20 august 2019,taurus,"Everyone makes mistakes now and then, and you are no exception. Stop beating yourself up already and get on with it. There IS a silver lining to mistakes: if you learn from them, you can change and grow. Then you can laugh at yourself years from now!

"
21 august 2019,taurus,"Stop pushing yourself so hard, Taurus! Venus, the planet of chilling out with a glass of champagne in your hand, is now in your house of romance. And having fun. And shopping. Need I say more? I don’t think so. Start pampering yourself and relax.

"
22 august 2019,taurus,"People may be sending mixed signals, and it’s going to take effort to remain calm. Using the same old methods to find out what’s going on with them isn’t going to work either. Try a new approach, one that you haven’t used before. If you usually lose your temper, for example, remain calm and collected.

"
25 august 2019,taurus,"Just how much should you reveal? You have a lot going on in your head and heart, and you may be anxious to let it all out. But a Chiron-Mars aspect recommends that you should only share some of it. This isn’t about being deceptive. The reality is that your mind may change dramatically later in the week, and what you believe now may be completely altered soon.

Settling for less than you deserve, especially when it comes to money or love? Then snap out of it, because powerhouse Pluto is demanding that you get your fair share! That said, the good fairy won’t be showing up at your place anytime soon, delivering the goods. It’s up to you to go after them.

"
14 march 2019,gemini,"
Go tell it from the mountain! This is one heck of a good day to toot your own horn, Gemini. A Sun-Mercury meet-up allows you to showcase your talent on the job front. It’s also a strong aspect for dealing with loved ones, who need to know that your dreams need to be respected.

"

The Libra full moon could make romance sizzle! This lunation occurs in your house of love, so something important could come to pass: an engagement, maybe, or meeting a new amour. But Mars is in a tough angle, indicating that you could be dealing with fears that aren’t really based on reality. Don’t let them get the better of you.

"
22 march 2019,gemini,"
You weren’t put on this planet to be everyone’s go-to person when things head south for them. It’s one thing to be a good friend and another to be a doormat or enabler. Make sure that you’re associating with people who give to you the way you give to them.

"
23 march 2019,gemini,"
On a diet? Trying to stop swearing, smoking or trawling the net? Then you need to ramp up your discipline today, my friend. A tough Uranus-Moon opposition could put you in a “what the hell” kind of a mood in which you’ll convince yourself to cheat. Fortunately this will be over by tomorrow!

"
24 march 2019,gemini,"
If you’ve been considering a new job, field or your own business, now’s the time to take action. “Action” could simply be sitting down with a notepad and jotting down ideas. The key is to stop saying “someday” and to take some steps now,  even if they’re baby steps.

"
25 march 2019,gemini,"
Diplomacy counts today; so does teamwork. Fortunately the Sun and Moon are in a terrific place to help you play nice with others. But once assertive Mars rolls into your sign next Sunday, it’s all about you, baby.

"
27 march 2019,gemini,"Your ambition rises to make a name for yourself, but you won’t be shouting this from the rooftops. If anything you’re going to keep quiet about things while you hustle. That’s a smart strategy, my friend: keep prying eyes away from your personal business. By the time people find out what you’re up to you’ll be miles ahead.

"
31 march 2019,gemini,"Woo-hoo! Mars enters Gemini, shining its red hot spotlight on you. Nothing is going to stop you from achieving what’s most important to you.

"
9 april 2019,gemini,"Are there too many “strings attached” in your dealings with other people?  Are people making you feel as though you always owe them something? If that’s the case, it may be time to cut the ties and move on. You need to be around people who are givers, the kind who enjoy life and who aren’t tallying up favors.

"
10 april 2019,gemini,"Serious relationships go under a microscope now that Jupiter is retrograde. This will affect business alliances in addition to romantic ones. Between now and mid-August, you’ll be questioning the balance of power and where things are heading. Some of you could become quite independent and decide to fly solo!

"
11 april 2019,gemini,"Your inspiration to live a better life increases exponentially! With dreamy Neptune meeting up with Venus, planet of both love and money, you can’t go wrong. Just avoid people who will try to tell you that “it can’t be done”. What the hell do they know? If they’re going to try to hold you back, then maybe they shouldn’t be along for the ride.

"
12 april 2019,gemini,"Someone could be critical today, or maybe they’re not acting like a team player. Who cares? You’ve got bigger fish to fry. With so much activity in your house of ambition, you won’t really notice the buzz kill types.

"
13 april 2019,gemini,"People could be in a pissy, petty mood today. But don’t let this interrupt the flow of your precious chi. Just avoid known trouble makers and hang out with people who respect you. There’s a lot of fun to be had this weekend if you surround yourself with the right kind of people.

"
14 april 2019,gemini,"Two fabulous aspects today encourage you to enjoy the company of other people over the next 48 hours. This could be with a lover, friends or industry types. Some amazing partnerships could develop, and you might end up being transformed as a result. It’s all good.

"
15 april 2019,gemini,"A Jupiter-Venus square could bring out the stubborn side of people. Being diplomatic and understanding may not work, so don’t let this situation bother you. By Wednesday the energy changes and people will be more amenable to your common sense.

"
16 april 2019,gemini,"Wishy washy behavior from others could find you scratching your head in confusion. Don’t expect this to go away today; wait 24 hours. Tomorrow verbal Mercury enters your house of teamwork, enabling you to deal with people diplomatically.

"
17 april 2019,gemini,"Choose your friends wisely, Gemini. Now that shrewd Mercury is in your house of friends and colleagues, you should only surround yourself with people who back you up 100%. The people you know could be instrumental in changing your life in ways that you simply can’t imagine right now.

"
18 april 2019,gemini,"Your emotions could go all over the place due to a Moon-Pluto square. It’s frustrating, because you’ve been trying to keep your thoughts and feelings in a more positive place. This is just a temporary situation, though. Once the Sun rolls into Taurus on Saturday it will be far easier to make progress.

"
19 april 2019,gemini,"Feeling mushy and romantic? It’s not surprising with the full moon occurring in your fifth house of amour. But despite the warm and fuzzy vibes going on you could still feel a tad independent. But this is a good thing. Since when has clinginess ever been attractive?

"
20 april 2019,gemini,"The Sun enters the quietest, more secretive part of your chart. The next four weeks are an amazing time for rest and recuperation. It’s also wise to do some much needed inner work, releasing negative habits and thoughts. But you won’t be doing this all by yourself. Gentle Venus glides into your house of friends today. Don’t be afraid to lean on them for comfort and advice.

"
21 april 2019,gemini,"Even though aggressive Mars is in your sign, you still need to be a team player. Today is a smart time to cooperate with others due to a Moon-Mercury trine. However, there is a part of you that you intend to keep to yourself. Not everyone needs to know your deepest secrets.

"
22 april 2019,gemini,"Sometimes emotional healing takes years on a therapist’s couch. Other times it can happen in an instant. A very cathartic Sun-Uranus aspect brings rapid realizations, the desire to change and a deep sense of contentment. Amen.

"
23 april 2019,gemini,"Jupiter is the planet of abundance, and today it forms a perfect aspect with the emotional Moon in your house of commitment. Your outlook towards love will become sunnier. It’s important to feel as though you have some say as to what is going on in a romance, so don’t be afraid to speak up.

"
24 april 2019,gemini,"Hold onto your heart… and your wallet! Mighty Pluto begins to retrograde in your eighth house of net worth and serious intimacy. This could actually be quite cathartic, as Pluto is like a phoenix rising from the ashes. You will need to take a good long look at how you handle your relationship with love and money.

"
25 april 2019,gemini,"You’re playing for keeps! It doesn’t matter if we’re talking about love or money, you’re pretty serious about your decisions. And why not? With assertive Mars in your sign, you’re starting to fixate on what’s most important.

"
26 april 2019,gemini,"Pay attention to your intuition, Gemini. It’s on target. But a lunar aspect could make you feel as though you know better, which could make you take unnecessary risks. Play it conservative for now.

"
27 april 2019,gemini,"You will not be in the mood for wishy washy people who can’t make up their minds. Nor are you going to settle for nebulous situations. However, trying to force issues or people won’t work. Sometimes you just have to sit tight and wait for amore answers, and this is one of those times.

"
28 april 2019,gemini,"Discipline is not the same thing as karma, Gemini. You’re not stuck living a pre-ordained life that doesn’t suit you. But changing your circumstances often requires discipline and hard work. Know the difference between these two and you’ll gain wisdom.

"
29 april 2019,gemini,"Drama, begone! Now that stern Saturn is retrograde in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, it’s time to reflect on how you handle certain people and situations. This is especially true when it comes to romance. Over the next few months you are going to grow up a lot, becoming calmer and more at peace with yourself.

"
30 april 2019,gemini,"People could be talking in circles today, something that won’t sit well with you. It will be even more annoying if it’s someone who’s a decision maker, or someone you’re relying on to get things done. Keep your emotions under control and don’t let this get to you.

"
1 may 2019,gemini,"“It’s not what you know, it’s who you know that counts.” Gemini, that old saying means a lot due to a Mercury-Mars meet up. With aggressive Mars in the networking part of your chart, you should be doing everything possible to meet new people and reconnect with others. Work it, honey.

"
2 may 2019,gemini,"Guilt, fear, bribery….yup, people will be ready to use whatever “weapon” they can today. But you’re not stupid enough to fall for it.

"
3 may 2019,gemini,"Friends, lovers and colleagues could be quite lucky for you today, so keep your cell phone powered up! You never know who might send that winning text your way. Make a point to get out there and circulate.

"
4 may 2019,gemini,"Ready for some emotional and psychological healing? The new moon takes place in the secluded, restful house of closure. Logical Mercury glides into this sector on Monday, so you are in an excellent position to do some much needed inner work. Seek the help of a professional or a confidante if you need it.

"
5 may 2019,gemini,"Pushy Mars is in your sign, and it could be making you quite assertive. Aggressive even. This is not necessarily a good state to be in, especially today with Mars opposing Jupiter. You run the risk of trying to lay down the law with someone close. Don’t go there, because it will backfire. Wait until Thursday to make your move.

"
6 may 2019,gemini,"Right now you’re looking like the most psychic of all the twelve sings, which means that you’re armed and extremely dangerous! Seriously, you should be using this energy to your (secret) advantage. Shrewd Mercury just entered the house of the subconscious mind, joining the Sun and Uranus. Go ahead and snoop.

"
7 may 2019,gemini,"You may be tempted to cut someone slack, but is that wise? You know what they say: give someone an inch, they’ll take a mile. This is true in personal relationships as well as professional ones. Don’t be afraid to draw a line in the sand.

"
8 may 2019,gemini,"Sshhhh!! Your best work will be done behind the scenes today. Shrewd Mercury meets up with genius Uranus in your house of confidentiality. It’s an excellent day to look for another job or research starting up your own business. Snoop the competition, develop a new product line, but whatever you do, keep it on the down low.

"
9 may 2019,gemini,"It pays to be cooperative and work well with others, both in your personal and professional lives. Does this mean that everyone is going to be friendly and chipper? No it does not. But don’t let that get in your way. Rise above their petty behavior and be the true class act that you are.

"
10 may 2019,gemini,"Square peg in a round hole? You may feel as though you don’t fit in, or that others don’e share your ideals. But that’s OK. Tomorrow begins a number of wonderful aspects that will lat for several weeks, in which you will realize that you don’t have  to fit in! A healing, peaceful time is ahead. Namaste.

"
11 may 2019,gemini,"You could come to some quiet decisions today about matters with far reaching consequences. This shouldn’t be a painful process either, but a peaceful one. You’re stepping into a place of greater personal power and it shows.

"
12 may 2019,gemini,"Your sign is famous for the ability to communicate but today you can outdo yourself. A positive Moon-Venus trine allows you to get the words out in an eloquent manner….without a show of force! Getting people around to your way of thinking is possible, which means that they’re also more likely to do what you want (another bonus).

"
13 may 2019,gemini,"You’re in secret agent mode today, always an interesting place to be. A meeting of the illuminating Sun and probing Pluto allows you to dig deep.  Sure, you could snoop your lover’s text messages on their phone, but this energy is better spent in other ways. Use it to improve your finances, health or mental state, anything that’s really significant.

"
14 may 2019,gemini,"You can get a point across to someone without a lot of force, Gemini. With assertive Mars in your sign you run the risk of being too pushy these days. But a terrific Mars-Venus trine enables you to speak your piece with grace. Keep this in mind for the rest of the week, as the energy continues.

"
15 may 2019,gemini,"It’s time to become stealthier, Gemini! Venus glides into your mysterious twelfth house of research, soul-searching and confidentiality. At the same time her companion Mars enters the house of creating stability, which includes love and money. Do what’s needed to shore up the foundations of your life without making big announcements about it.

"
16 may 2019,gemini,"Personal decisions can be made with a lot of fanfare, or they can be so subtle that others don’t even know what you’re up to. A positive (yet secretive) Mercury-Saturn aspect enables you to get in touch with your deepest emotions and make serious decisions that come from the heart…with some logic thrown in for good measure.

"
17 may 2019,gemini,"Just how many close connections do you need to have in your life? Some people pride themselves on the number of people they know; others prefer to keep a close coterie of intimate confidantes. Consider what works best for you.

"
18 may 2019,gemini,"You really  need to start taking better care of yourself, Gemini. The full moon takes place in your house of habits and health. Uranus is practically yelling at you to slow down, chill out and walk away from responsibilities (or people) that are weighing you down. It’s time for some extreme self-care, but it starts with you. Treat your body and mind as though they are a temple.

"
19 may 2019,gemini,"How’s your health, Gemini? The Sun spends a few more days in your house of physical and mental well being before it enters your sign. Now’s the time to take care of diet, fitness or ailment issues. Your birthday season is almost here and you need to be firing on all cylinders.

"
20 may 2019,gemini,"Don’t expect people in your world to follow a strict set of rules that you’ve created, or that society believes in. Deal with people from your heart first. When the Sun enters your sign tomorrow you’ll start to loosen up a bit.

"
21 may 2019,gemini,"Yippee kiyay! Your birthday season officially begins, and this year it’s extra special. The Sun just entered your sign, and so did vivacious Mercury. These two are forming a bromance as they pass through your sign over the next few weeks. El Sol solidifies your authority and independence, while Mercury increases your brain power. Today is a great time to create a bucket list for the year ahead.

"
22 may 2019,gemini,"Your subconscious mind will be hyperactive over the next 48 hours, and this is a good  thing. It could provide you with a solution to a problem that has been vexing you, or ideas for a brand new way of living. The bottom line is that if you act on these ideas, your life will feel a lot more stable–and therefore your emotions will too.

"
23 may 2019,gemini,"Chasing after the almighty dollar may not be worth it if your values are out of sync, Gemini. Today is a good time to put thought into what you’re doing for a living and why. Money isn’t everything; peace of mind and happiness count for a lot too.

"
24 may 2019,gemini,"You can’t trust your judgment today, Gemini. Period. A Moon-Venus square indicates that you will be operating on pure emotion and not logic, which is not a good thing. Keep your opinions to yourself. It may take a good week for the cosmic skies to clear, so don’t make any major decisions until then.

"
25 may 2019,gemini,"If life has become a bit….(yawn) predictable, it’s time to shake things up. Thanks to the moon in the feistiest part of your chart, you’ll have no trouble dreaming up ways to be more bold. You only live once, Gemini. Make the most of it.

"
26 may 2019,gemini,"Don’t feel as though you’re being selfish by taking some “alone time”. You truly need it. This doesn’t mean that you should cut out friends or people who mean a lot to you. Just make sure that you’re surrounding yourself right now with people who fill you up, not the kind who drain you.

"
27 may 2019,gemini,"Recently it may have seemed as though other people had the upper hand. Maybe you were thinking that you would never be able to get ahead or gain some control. Persistence pays off, my friend. A wonderful lunar aspect helps put you on a level playing field.

"
28 may 2019,gemini,"It will be difficult to figure out what people are saying and thinking today, Gemini. And with your hyperactive brain, you will be going into overdrive trying to figure them out. Don’t waste your time. The bottom line is that they’re confused. When they eventually gain clarity, so will you.

"
29 may 2019,gemini,"Sometimes being straightforward and open can work against you, and today is one of those times. A Mercury-Neptune square warns you to say little, especially at the job or when dealing with authority figures. Pay attention to what they’re saying and doing instead. Neptune is blowing a lot of fog around; you’ll need to be at your perceptive best to figure out what muckety mucks are up to.

"
30 may 2019,gemini,"It looks like you’re going to have to be the voice of reason today, Gemini. People may be overly optimistic about things, or unable to come up with a logical thought and plan. If a situation or relationship looks like it’s going off the rails, then step in and be the boss.

"
31 may 2019,gemini,"Feeling like a sexy secret agent? An international man of mystery (“the name is Bond, James Bond”)? Or a deliciously saucy femme fatale? You can thank a Venus-Neptune trine for this delightful state of affairs (and I do mean affairs). If you really want to work this energy, though, leave something to the imagination. Don’t put all your goods on display. Keep ’em guessing.

"
1 june 2019,gemini,"You’re better off right now being the power behind the throne rather than being on center stage. It’s a better strategy to do your thing quietly. This will throw off competitors, trolls and anyone else who’d like to see you fall flat on your face. It certainly will be fun having the last laugh, won’t it?

"
2 june 2019,gemini,"You’re pretty much done  with vague promises and situations that aren’t right for you. And the good thing is that you’re ready to do something about it. But before you dive in, spend some quiet time alone and think things through. Better yet, tap into your intuition, which is pretty strong right now.

"
3 june 2019,gemini,"Woo-hoo! Today’s new Moon occurs in Gemini, placing your dreams on center stage. If you’re willing to hustle, you can make terrific headway by December. There is some wonky energy, however, surrounding this lunation. Financial and romantic matters can shine, as long as  you keep things private or confidential. The other issue is that you can’t give your power over to someone else. A lover, boss or business partner could try to push you in a direction that you don’t want to go in.

"
4 june 2019,gemini,"Shrewd Mercury enters your money sector, a beneficial event. Red hot Mars has been there for some time, which could have spurred you to spend more money than is reasonable. Mercury’s logical thinking will balance Mars’s assertiveness. Don’t forget, Mars is the great motivator….use its energy wisely to further your financial situation.

"
5 june 2019,gemini,"Motivator Mars fires you up to create stronger foundations in your life, at all levels. You’re starting to realize that you can’t go on living in limbo. Nor is it your karma to be handed the table scraps of life. A positive mental shift is occurring, so take it and run with it.

"
6 june 2019,gemini,"Some people like to shove their sex appeal in everyone’s faces with boobs hanging out of their blouses or tight pants that leave nothing to the imagination (“Is that a sock?”). But not you, Gemini. Glamorous, seductive Venus is in the most hidden part of your chart, allowing you to be sexy and classy at the same time.

"
7 june 2019,gemini,"Anyone who thinks that you’re a pushover is in for a big surprise. You are going to hang on tenaciously to your position or desires. But don’t make a big production out of this; keep your determination under wraps.

"
11 june 2019,gemini,"The Sun in your sign is making you quite independent, and rational too. Which is precisely why you’re going to have a problem with people who want to blow smoke up your tuckus. People may not be intentionally trying to deceive you, but they could be overly optimistic about where things are going. Keep it real, even if that pisses them off.Gemini

"
12 june 2019,gemini,"Damn, you’re motivated! A meeting of Mars and the North Node of the Moon fires you up to start creating more stability in your life. You might want to start with money and romance, as they are well favored right now.The most important thing to realize is that you’re not stuck in a particular situation.

"
13 june 2019,gemini,"You’re not one to follow the crowd, at least not this week! With the Sun in your sign you should be feeling more independent than usual. If anyone tries to rein you in, politely let them know that you’re perfectly happy being exactly who you are.

"
14 june 2019,gemini,"Live for the moment, Gemini! From your chart it appears that you’re getting too bogged down in the future. Quit trying so hard to predict outcomes and stage manage everything that’s going on. Loosen up a little bit and enjoy the process instead.

"
15 june 2019,gemini,"When the going gets tough, the tough get going….and its time for you to take that attitude! Quit selling yourself short, thinking that you don’t have the brains or the brawn to pull something off. You do, and your rivals will be left in the dust.

"
16 june 2019,gemini,"Sometimes the path ahead isn’t a straight line; it’s full of twists and turns and detours. But that can often be the best way to get to a destination. Don’t be too anxious to get ahead, Gemini. Things may not seem straightforward to you  now, but in the end you’ll realize why things had to take time.

"
17 june 2019,gemini,"Romantic matters could be murky, and tonight’s full moon is trying to shed light on them. The problem is that foggy Neptune is in a tough angle to the Moon, making it hard to know what’s going on. The same holds true for business relationships. Wait until the Sun enters Cancer this Friday for more clarity.

"
18 june 2019,gemini,"It’s a great day for planning the future thanks to a Saturn-Neptune aspect. Saturn helps us make good long term decisions, while Neptune opens our eyes to fresh possibilities. This week is better for planning than taking action, though, as tomorrow brings some cosmic storms.

"
19 june 2019,gemini,"The bloviators are out there today, and they may be trying to get you to part with your money. It’s also possible that an employer, client, lawyer or someone else will play hard ball, trying to get you to accept terms that aren’t worth it. Keep calm and carry on, because the Sun enters your money house on Friday.

"
20 june 2019,gemini,"Keep big ideas to yourself, Gemini. The idea stealers are out there, along with the Debbie Downers.  You also need to protect the secrets of others, which includes trade or industry information. Once Mercury changes signs on Wednesday the 26th you can open up a little bit.

"
21 june 2019,gemini,"The Sun enters your income zone, which should be good news when it comes to landing more money. The issue is that Neptune starts to retrograde in your career zone at the same time. What this means is that you need to slow down and consider all of your options carefully. Don’t rush into anything until you have all of the facts.

"
22 june 2019,gemini,"The Moon enters Pisces, the part of your chart that loves the luxe life. This is a good weekend for treating yourself to a nice treat (without breaking the bank, though!). Romance sizzles too, and the time is right for lining up a more defined future.

"
23 june 2019,gemini,"Promises, promises! People might make them, but will they follow through? With a Venus-Jupiter opposition things may look good on the surface, but you need to do some digging to see if they’re legit. And make sure that you’re not making agreements that you can’t deliver on either.

"
24 june 2019,gemini,"Trying to get a straight answer from someone—especially a decision maker—could be tough. Neptune is swirling its mist, indicating that people could be confused or worse—deceptive. Thursday rocks for getting down to business, so if possible, wait until then. Your intuition will be just as strong as your logic.

"
25 june 2019,gemini,"Perhaps you’re tired of playing nice and doing things to appease other people. If that’s the case, a lunar aspect will help you assert more independence. Better yet is that verbal Mercury enters your house of communicating tomorrow. You’ll have plenty to say!

"
26 june 2019,gemini,"Talk much? Your sign is famous for gabbing and thinking and now you have the cosmos’s permission to do just that. Verbal Mercury is now in your house of communicating. If you have a message to get out there, do it before July 7th when the messenger planet goes retrograde.

"
27 june 2019,gemini,"Getting rid of a bad habit or way of thinking could be a snap today, Gemini! No twelve-step program, no years on a therapist’s couch. Sometimes change happens in an instant. If you’re willing to be open to that idea, metamorphosis can occur.

"
28 june 2019,gemini,"The next 48 hours have a restful, healing energy about them. On an emotional and physical level, it’s time to start feeling better. The solar eclipse on July 3rd falls your house of habits, and it will kickstart a brand new chapter in which you can create smarter routines. Discipline will bring you results.

"
29 june 2019,gemini,"Some interesting news could come your way, or a winner of an idea. If that’s the case you shouldn’t hesitate to take action. Some research may need to be done first but that’s a smart thing to do.

"
30 june 2019,gemini,"You may need to be the voice of reason today, so be prepared to lay down the law. Others may be operating on pure hope and fantasy, never a good thing! Bring them down to Earth as diplomatically as possible.

"
1 july 2019,gemini,"Can we talk? Megamouth Mars enters your communications sector, turning you into someone to be recognized! Use this special planetary energy to socialize and catch up with friends. Flirt like a pro. Promote your resume or brand. Go on the lecture circuit or become a consultant. Just take note: Mercury is in this house too and it goes retrograde on the 7th.

"
2 july 2019,gemini,"Money talks and it’s practically screaming at you today. It’s time to get a lot more serious about planning for the future. Conservative Saturn is in your net worth sector, telling you to develop better saving and investing habits.

"
3 july 2019,gemini,"No more shaky situations for you, Gemini. A solar eclipse in one of the most solid parts of your chart demands answers and guarantees. This is true in your romantic life as well as your financial one. Between now and December you can create better circumstances for yourself. The key is to think long term, not just about the near future. If you have any doubts about whether a person or situation can go the distance, then walk away.

"
4 july 2019,gemini,"Yesterday’s solar eclipse occurred in your money house, so it’s time to go after more cash. But from your chart it appears that you may feel stuck, as if you couldn’t possibly do something different with your career. Stern Saturn is in your net worth sector, and it demands that you do things conservatively. However, that doesn’t mean that you have to remain in the same job or field. Be open to fresh ideas.

"
5 july 2019,gemini,"Great day to release pent-up emotions and ideas, safely and calmly. With the Moon in your house of talking and connecting, this is the moment to let others know what’s going on in that head of yours. Do it now because Mercury is going to go retrograde here on Sunday!

"
6 july 2019,gemini,"Spending time with family and loved ones is what counts with the Moon in Virgo. Try to get any issues out to the way today, if you can—Mercury starts to retrograde tomorrow in your house of communicating!

"
7 july 2019,gemini,"You really  need to watch your words, Gemini! Big mouth Mars is in your house of thinking, speaking and writing. Mercury is there too, and today it goes retrograde. This doesn’t last long: it’s over on the 19th. But you don’t want to say anything that you’ll regret, so think before you speak.

"
8 july 2019,gemini,"Pay attention to your own wisdom today rather than relying on the advice of others. They may get offended that you’re not listening to them, but it’s your life, babe. With the Sun in Cancer you’r coming from a very logical place.

"
9 july 2019,gemini,"Tighten your belt, Gemini. It’s time to play closer attention to your finances and plan for the long term.  A Sun-Saturn opposition demands maturity and discipline. The good news is that an auspicious trine on Thursday could help you earn more.

"
10 july 2019,gemini,"It seems like everyone wants a piece of you these days, and that’s a good thing! But before you “spread the wealth”, so to speak, you should consider just who and what you’re giving your time to. Not everyone should be in the loop.

"
11 july 2019,gemini,"Watch your temper and watch out even more with your words. An aggressive Mars-Uranus square could prompt you to say or text something you might regret. You might also realize that someone is not all they’re cracked up to be. It’s best to keep this observation to yourself for now.

"
12 july 2019,gemini,"The next 48 hours are wonderful for socializing thanks to a Moon-Venus connection. There is so much planetary activity in your career sector this month; make sure that you take some down time. Romantic alliances can also do well right now!

"
13 july 2019,gemini,"Oooh la la! The passionate Moon meets up with lucky, generous Jupiter in your house of serious love. Make this a special date night (or all day event) with your sweetie. No sweetie in sight? Then circulate in your local neighborhood, as lusty Mars and amorous Venus are in this sector.

"
14 july 2019,gemini,"Money matters are developing momentum thanks to an upcoming eclipse in your wealth sector on Tuesday. Watch out for anyone who is playing hard ball, trying to get you to do something that might benefit them more than it will help you. This could be a stock broker, real estate agent, attorney, potential boss or client or banker. Maybe it’s even someone with whom you share assets. Look out for #1, my friend.

"
15 july 2019,gemini,"It’s a wonderful day for teaming up with people you love…..and maybe even someone you’d like to have as a romantic partner! A juicy Moon-Jupiter conjunction brings out your best. Jupiter is also known for doling out some luck here and there, so something unusual but positive could happen.

"
16 july 2019,gemini,"A major celestial event occurs today—a lunar eclipse in your eighth house of deep emotions and net worth. Yup: sex, intimacy and investments and “unearned” money are all in the same house, which makes this one loaded sector. And because lunar eclipses are full moons, something could be coming to a close. This can go either way, depending on what’s going on in your life: breaking up or getting engaged. A court award could go your way, or not. The key right now is to focus on long term ramifications, not on what you want today.

"
17 july 2019,gemini,"Trying to wiggle out of a situation won’t work, Gemini! You’re better off facing the issue head on. Passive aggressive games, “poor little me” routines, putting on the charm offensive–forget about it. Keep things real. People will respect you more for that.

"
18 july 2019,gemini,"Go posh or go home! A lovely Venus-Neptune trine tells you that it’s perfectly OK to pamper yourself and/or a loved one. (Gotta love it when the cosmos tells you to splurge, even if just a little bit). So book a manicure or a massage, dine in a more upscale cafe, or treat yourself to some new clothes. Keep it affordable and enjoy yourself.

"
19 july 2019,gemini,"Mercury retrogrades back into your income sector, reviving issues that may have come up earlier in the year. This is actually a good thing: the boss may be willing to give you a raise, or a company that had a hiring freeze awhile back may now be able to employ you. But you should also be reviewing your expenses and savings to see where you can improve your habits.

"
20 july 2019,gemini,"How should you handle things: should you come on strong or be laid back? That’s the question posed by today’s Pluto-Venus opposition. The reality is that neither approach will work right now; you need to find a middle ground. Once the Sun enters Leo on Monday you’ll gain more clarity and be able to express yourself better.

"
21 july 2019,gemini,"This is the last day that the Sun will be in your income house, so take advantage of it! In a sweet cosmic coincidence, El Sol forms a perfect aspect with shrewd negotiator Mercury. Ask for the raise, the job or the business. Seek out new and better ways of making money. Cut deals and self promote. It’s all good.

"
22 july 2019,gemini,"A match made in the heavens for people of the Gemini persuasion: the Sun enters Leo, your house of socializing! Over the next four weeks you should be partying and networking like crazy. Short distance trips are highly favored, as is romance. The cosmic lovers–Mars and Venus—will both be in this sector as of Saturday, so get ready for amour.

"
23 july 2019,gemini,"Your social life picks up momentum! High octane Mars and the passionate Moon are in the mood for partying, hanging out in the neighborhood or going on a quick trip out of town. Singles, you could meet someone locally, so dress to impress—even if you’re going to the laundromat.

"
24 july 2019,gemini,"You could be in quite a generous mood as diplomatic Mercury and loving Venus meet up in the heavens. Just make sure that you’re not SO generous that you’re going to be taken advantage of. People need to be worthy (and grateful!) of  your kindness.

"
25 july 2019,gemini,"If you have something to say to someone, or a message you want to get out to the world at large, now is the time to do it. Some terrific aspects occur over the next four days will enable you to be spot on. Today red hot Mars in your communicating sector forms an alliance with lucky Jupiter in your partnership zone. Business and romantic relationships will benefit big time.

"
26 july 2019,gemini,"Tone down your words and try to keep emotions out of the picture, Gemini. A Mars-Saturn aspect demands more logical thought than just going on feelings. That’s OK, you’ll get your dose of the feels. Tomorrow Venus enters the most expressive part of your chart.

"
27 july 2019,gemini,"Phew. Thank heavens that Venus is now in your house of self expression. To be honest, you were running the risk of coming on too strong, due to the fiery Sun and aggressive Mars already in this sector. Now you can get further with charm and diplomacy. Go ahead, work your magic!

"
28 july 2019,gemini,"Any doubts that you’ve had about being able to pull something off start to disappear! I’m not talking about pulling off a bank heist. I’m referring to some kind of dream that seems farfetched, something that takes you out of your comfort zone. You’re starting to realize that you do have the chops to go for it. And whatever you don’t know, you’ll learn along the way.

"
29 july 2019,gemini,"What’s going on there??!!  Your brain might be working on overdrive, dreaming up problems and dramas that don’t have any basis in reality. So stop playing psychic super sleuth, because your sixth sense isn’t worth a damn today. Chill out and let things go.

"
30 july 2019,gemini,"It my seem as though other people have the upper hand, but that’s not a problem for your clever sign! With motivator Mars in your house of communicating, you’ll be able to get your point across with charm. Better yet, your words will inspire people to think differently….about you and what you have to say.

"
31 july 2019,gemini,"Woo-hoo! Mercury goes direct in your house of income and savings. Raises and job offers that were held up should start to move forward. So should negotiations with clients and increasing business revenues. This energy lasts til August 11th, so make the most of it.

"
1 august 2019,gemini,"The Leo new moon opens up a brand new social season for you, one in which you should  be wining and dining and schmoozing. And networking for business, cutting deals and promoting your brand. So why are you holding back? Hmmm…it’s probably due to Uranus, which is making you doubt yourself. Or it could be that you don’t completely trust the people around you and need to feel them out first, which is a smart move.

"
2 august 2019,gemini,"The trolls and passive-aggressive types could be on the prowl today, ready to stir up their usual petty nonsense. Even a lover or close friend could act erratically. Fortunately you have gentle Venus in your house of thinking and communicating, so you won’t fly off the handle. Next week you’ll have the opportunity to put the trolls in their place.

"
3 august 2019,gemini,"Nesting at home is on the agenda this weekend as the Moon glides into your domestic sector. But you could also head out to the home design stores, shopping for new linens, furniture and wall coverings. August is a good time to create a sanctuary at home, like a meditation/yoga room. Don’t have that kind of space? Then put together a “shrine” on a small tabletop, dedicated to peace and personal growth.

"
4 august 2019,gemini,"Heaven knows you love to talk, and with megamouth Mars in your communication zone, you run the risk of coming on too strong. So consider a better way of getting your message across without sounding wimpy! You absolutely need to make a point, so don’t clam up. Just use a little more diplomacy, that’s all.

"
5 august 2019,gemini,"They say that flattery will get you everywhere, and sometimes that’s true. But right now you’re better off showing people that you have what it takes to make things happen. This could be at work, of course, but also within a romantic or family situation. People might be underestimating you. Show them that they’re wrong!

"
6 august 2019,gemini,"Your subconscious mind is a bit too overactive today, making all sorts of crazy thoughts pop into your mind. Therefore, think before you say or do anything as your intuition could be off. It may also be difficult to stick to routines and habits under this aspect. Do you really need that piece of cheesecake or double martini? No? Then stay on track.

"
7 august 2019,gemini,"Good heavens, you have the diplomacy of an ambassador trying to resolve an international dispute. You have the kind of salesmanship that could sell ice cream to Eskimos. Crushing it on social media is possible, along with landing a book deal or an agent. Let’s not even talk about how charismatic you are to potential suitors. Is it the perfume you’re wearing? Nope, it’s an awesome Jupiter-Sun aspect. Work it, honey. Work it good.

"
8 august 2019,gemini,"Long lasting love is in the stars, thanks to a delightful Sun-Venus connection. Considering that Venus is in your house of communicating, you should feel free to speak your mind about important matters. Geminis looking for love could find a keeper, and in their own town at that. No need to find someone in a different area code or time zone. As they say, “Shop local”!

"
9 august 2019,gemini,"Make sure that you’re congruous, Gemini. Your words and actions need to be solid. People need to feel as though they know where you’re coming from. This may require you to develop more self confidence or to switch up your image in some way. But what’s wrong with being authentic?

"
10 august 2019,gemini,"To your surprise you may realize that things that were important to you just aren’t anymore. It’s no big deal. It’s just that the Sun, Mars and Venus are all in the most thoughtful part of your chart, enlightening you. Inspirational Neptune is also active in your house of big dreams, so expect change. It’s for the better.

11 august 2019,gemini,"Peace at last? Erratic Uranus begins to retrograde in one of the most psychological parts of your chart, helping to quiet your overly busy mind. Jupiter resumes direct motion in your house of serious romance (hallelujah), and chatty Mercury enters your communicating sector! You can finally release pent-up thoughts and emotions in a productive way, to people who count.

"
12 august 2019,gemini,"You need to make some changes, Gemini. The kind that involve inner work. Your emotions and thoughts need to be calmer. Fortunately disciplined, mature Saturn forms a perfect angle with the Moon. Find a modality that works for you: meditating, journaling, seeking professional help or scheduling more free time for yourself. You’ll be happier as a result!

"
13 august 2019,gemini,"“Everyone is entitled to MY opinion!” Oh really? Think twice before you take this stance. Hey, your ideas and thoughts could be absolutely brilliant and 100% on point. But that doesn’t mean that people need to be reminded of that. Sometimes ya just gotta keep your genius to yourself, Gemini.

"
14 august 2019,gemini,"Grab your keys and head for the door, Gemini! You need to be out circulating today. A delicious Sun-Venus aspect is perfect for romance (finding it or increasing it), having cocktails with friends or schmoozing for business. Next week is going to be quite social too, so don’t get too bogged down with responsibilities. You must  enjoy this energy.

"
15 august 2019,gemini,"Yessss!!! The Aquarian full moon helps you dive into the more exciting part of life. It’s time to plan adventures and consider activities, philosophies and people you might not have thought were possible before. They are, and it’s up to you to chase them down.

"
16 august 2019,gemini,"People are saying one thing and your mind is saying another. Pay attention, though, and listen to others. Their opinions and advice may be more sound than you realize. The problem is that rebellious Uranus is active in the house of your subconscious mind, stirring up the doubting side of your brain.

"
17 august 2019,gemini,"Are you selling your soul for the sake of stability? Sometimes we stay in a job or relationship even if it’s lousy, because it might be better than what else is out there. (“Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.”) But years can go by, and you’ll always be wondering if there truly is a better option. Start thinking in a more visionary way, Gemini.

"
18 august 2019,gemini,"Home is where the heart is, and it’s where your focus will be over the next four-plus weeks. Mars has just entered Virgo, your fourth house of home and family. Other celestial orbs will follow later this week. Do you need or want to move? Redecorate? Perhaps you and a lover need to discuss living together, to starting a family of your own. Just don’t get too pushy about things, a possibility with Mars in this sector.

"
19 august 2019,gemini,"Take some time off for yourself and just have fun. You desperately need some down time, and with the Moon in your house of friends you should make plans with the tribe. Yes, it’s a Monday, but so what. The planets don’t follow our working schedule and they’re telling you to chill out!

"
20 august 2019,gemini,"Being direct and to the point could work against you today, especially in a group setting. People don’t want to hear the truth, nor are they ready for cutting edge ideas. It will take them some time to reach that point, so hold off until the time is right.

"
21 august 2019,gemini,"Got something to say to a lover or family member? Then today is your day. With silver tongued Mercury at your service you can settle old arguments, talk about money quietly and discuss the future without drama. You’re entering into a very content, settled place over the next few weeks, so make peace now.

"
22 august 2019,gemini,"Cutting through red tape and weasel words is going to be a task today, Gemini. With sharp-as-a-tack Mercury in your house of thinking, you’re focused and realistic. Problem is, others will be blowing smoke your way. Keep calm and observe rather than talking and probing. Others’ actions will speak louder than their words.

"
23 august 2019,gemini,"Home and family matters take center stage thanks to the Sun entering your domestic sector. Assertive Mars happens to be in this house too, making you determined to resolve housing and relationship issues. Old issues from your childhood may come bubbling up to the surface next week, but this is positive: an amazing transformation could take place on your part.

"
24 august 2019,gemini,"Emotions get intense as Venus and Mars meet up in Virgo, but this is a positive thing! Many Geminis will get closer to their lover, having serious talks about the future. Anything related to housing is well aspected too as Virgo is your domestic sector. It’s a sentimental, mushy time, so enjoy it.

"
25 august 2019,gemini,"People who seem intent on pushing your buttons need to get out of your way, Gemini. This may mean setting boundaries. Or letting them know that you’re not interested in their opinions. You’re not fated by some horrible destiny to be surrounded by people who don’t support you! Start spending more time with those who respect and love you for what you are.

"
26 august 2019,gemini,"A happy event could occur today or over the next week, something that will put a smile on your face. Maybe you get engaged or conceive a baby. Perhaps you hear those three little words, or realize that you’re in love with someone. There is  an air of privacy around this, so don’t feel compelled to blab about it. The time will come for going public.

"
27 august 2019,gemini,"Serious financial and career decisions require thought and research right now; don’t avoid it! It’s critical that you create a strong foundation for yourself when it comes to savings, investments and job prospects. Your intuition is quite strong too, so use both logic and gut hunches to move ahead.

"
28 august 2019,gemini,"You need to vent and you need to do it in a productive manner. Fortunately brilliant Uranus is active in the most psychological part of your chart, helping you shake off the blues. There’s no need to take other people down, even if they’ve hurt you. What counts is that you feel good inside.

"
29 august 2019,gemini,"Your lively sign is known for being out there socializing, but right now you could be a homebody. That’s because planets are piling up in your fourth house of domesticity. Mercury joins Mars, Venus and the Sun there today. Actually this is beneficial as it appears that you need to settle some family business, which includes letting past dramas go bye-bye.

"
30 august 2019,gemini,"Just how important are those dreams of yours? Is it possible that you’ve outgrown some of them? If that’s the case today’s new moon in Virgo will point this out. Maybe you’re not even sure about what you want. That’s OK and to be expected, as murky Neptune opposes the moon. By mid-September you’ll have a much clearer idea about what you truly desire.

"
31 august 2019,gemini,"There’s a difference between lowering your standards and changing your mind, Gemini. If something isn’t working for you anymore, there’s nothing wrong with letting it go. As long as you replace it with something that speaks to your authentic self you will be on the right path.

"
1 september 2019,gemini,"Inner peace: it’s so elusive, and everyone wants it. Fortunately for you, Gemini, four planets are creating soothing aspects in the most emotional and psychological parts of your chart. But this isn’t just for today: this is a powerful catharsis that can turn your life around. This energy runs for two solid weeks so take advantage of it.

"
2 september 2019,gemini,"Housing, family and romantic matters heat up as assertive Mars tears through your domestic sector. Mars is like a double-edged sword; it can make good things happen quickly, or it can really mess things up by creating arguments and drama! So choose wisely. This is an emotional sector and it always benefits from a little logical thinking.

"
3 september 2019,gemini,"Family members and loved ones need to hear what’s on your mind, Gemini. Right now you have Mercury’s eloquence and Mars’s strength working on your behalf. From your chart it appears that some decisions need to be made; situations need to be resolved. And it looks like you’re the one who’s going to get the ball rolling. As usual.

"
4 september 2019,gemini,"Decision makers could be dragging their feet, which could make you feel unsettled. Romantic partners could also be wishy washy. You can choose to get annoyed and freak out, or decide to not let this throw off your inner sense of balance and serenity. By tomorrow the energy changes and you’ll feel more centered.

"
5 september 2019,gemini,"Building a strong foundation for your future is well aspected now, Gemini. Naturally this includes finances, but it also covers romance and mental health. One of the most important things you can do is to pay attention to your own wisdom rather than the advice of others. Go within. The answers you’re seeking are there.

"
6 september 2019,gemini,"You’re starting to realize that you don’t have to be responsible for someone else’s feelings, work load or problems. That doesn’t mean that you’re not willing to lend them a hand. Rather, you’re not going to let them dump their sh** on you. This will mean setting boundaries, of course, but it’s necessary. You have your own problems to contend with.

"
1 january 2019,cancer,"Happy new year, Cancer! You (and people of the Leo persuasion) are the most likely to start a diet and fitness program and stick with it. So don’t wait…pick your poison. Figure out what exercise regimen and eating program will work best for you, and dive in.

"
2 january 2019,cancer,"Joining forces with others is a significant move that you can make today. The Sun and Saturn are holding a power lunch in your house of committed relationships.

"
3 january 2019,cancer,"Think that you’re not smart enough? Not educated enough? You might feel that way due to a tense Mercury aspect. But nothing could be further from the truth. As a matter of fact, cosmic aspects on Friday are perfect for banishing this idea forever. Sign up for a class, listen to an informative webinar, or find a mentor who can help you.

"
4 january 2019,cancer,"Not everyone shares your sense of adventure, nor do they see things with your creative flair. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t associate with them. Sometimes you just have to agree to disagree!

"
5 january 2019,cancer,"Your closest connections are about to make a major turn tomorrow, courtesy of a solar eclipse in your house of partnerships. Fortunately you are in a practical place right now. Think long and hard about the kind of people you want to have with you on your journey. Not everyone will make the cut.

"
6 january 2019,cancer,"Big news in the cosmos! A solar eclipse occurs in your house of commitment, opening up doors that may have been firmly shut in the past. If you’re single and lonely, those days could be coming to an end by July. Those Cancers who are dating could see things get a lot more serious. Married crabs could experience a romantic renaissance. And with Uranus active in your house of tradition, you’re going to want things to be stable and sensible.

"
7 january 2019,cancer,"Sometimes getting into a good habit groove is a real challenge. Fortunately for you, Venus–planet of ease–glides into your efficiency sector today. You can make a lot of traction with your 2019 plans. Good thing too, because genius Uranus is now direct in your ambition sector.

"
8 january 2019,cancer,"Cooperation may be non-existent today. People may have a “my way or the highway” kind of attitude. You can let this get to you or let it slide. From your chart it appears that a boss or authority figure could be critical, so slap a smile on your face and soldier on.

"
9 january 2019,cancer,"You could do a 180 today, and this is a good thing. Spunky Uranus is active in your house of goals and ambition. Your passion is running high too. Why settle in life for situations that aren’t optimal? There’s nothing wrong with changing your direction.

"
10 january 2019,cancer,"Yum. The passionate Moon and amorous Neptune meet up in your house of romance, making today a sweet time for romance! But this also happens to be your house of creativity, so expect inspiration to be flowing in a big way.

"
11 january 2019,cancer,"It’s time to get serious about what you want out of a relationship. Don’t expect others to know what you’re thinking. The most important message that the cosmos has for you is to not settle. Make that clear to people who want to be in your life.

"
12 january 2019,cancer,"It may be the weekend but your mind will be on important long term goals and plans.

You have a jump on everyone else, as the Moon and Mars meet up in your house of ambition.

"
13 january 2019,cancer,"Pay attention if others have advice for you. Two heads are better than one. You may be taking an unrealistic view about a particular issue; don’t be afraid to ask for advice.

"
14 january 2019,cancer,"If you have found it difficult lately to find common ground with someone, that’s about to change. Sometimes you need to open your mind a bit for that to happen.

"
18 january 2019,cancer,"Your relationships with other people are under review, big-time. That’s because shrewd Mercury meets up with deep diving Pluto today in a conjunction. You won’t be willing to play the part of enabler anymore, or the “nice one”. You deserve respect. Claim it.

"
21 january 2019,cancer,"
Your income can take a nice leap forward over the next few months, thanks to today’s lunar eclipse in Leo. But in order to make the most of this aspect, you’re going to have to tiptoe carefully around business partners, bosses and clients. This doesn’t mean that you have to kowtow to them; just be diplomatic.

"
22 january 2019,cancer,"
Sometimes creating new habits and routines can be a real drag. Let’s face it… who wants to be disciplined? But a Venus-Jupiter conjunction helps you create new systems with ease. Good thing too, considering that yesterdays eclipse occurred in your house of stability.

"

"
24 january 2019,cancer,"
You have a reputation for being moody, but is that really the case? With logical Mercury entering your house of psychological depth, you could actually be the most chilled out person in the room. Over the next three weeks you can process old emotions that need to go.

"
25 january 2019,cancer,"

Ready to take some kind of creative risk? If you are, the results could be well worth it. Take a good long look at your circumstances. If you feel held back in any area, it’s time to reconsider your options.

"
29 january 2019,cancer,"
You can either let your emotions run your life or logic. And sometimes it seems that we’re often bouncing back and forth between the two. But a solid Sun-Mercury aspect today enables you to use both to your advantage.

"
1 february 2019,cancer,"
Take a breath and count to ten. Then back away slowly from the angry person in front of you! Seriously, a Mars-Pluto square could bring out the bossy worst in folks. It could be your spouse, boss or a cop who pulls you over. Don’t rattle their cages; it’s not worth it.

"
2 february 2019,cancer,"
An unexpected opportunity could come your way over the next few days, and if you’re wise you’ll take advantage of it. Make sure that you have everything lined up and organized. Look the part, dress the pact, act the part.

"
3 february 2019,cancer,"
From your chart it appears that you need a lot more support from people in your world. Now is the time to ask for it. This includes your kids, a lover, colleagues, family members or a business partner. If you persist in going it all alone, you’ll just end up becoming more resentful.

"
12 march 2019,cancer,"
Reality check! Either you need one, or the people in your world do. Heck, maybe all of you need it. A Jupiter-Sun square indicates that opinions will be flowing like wine. The problem is, are they based on anything logical? If you are certain that your ideas are realistic and on target, then you need to pay very close attention to what other people are saying and doing. They could be way off the mark.

"
13 march 2019,cancer,"

"
15 march 2019,cancer,"

8 april 2019,cancer,"There are a lot of people in your world who are expressing a lot of opinions lately. As a result, it could be easy to get confused. Some of these people have agendas that they’re hoping you will adopt. Stick to your guns. If something seems off, avoid it.

"
9 april 2019,cancer,"People could be touchy today. It seems that they are operating with a set of rules that they think everyone needs to obey. However, that’s their problem, not yours. You can choose to be diplomatic and play along or you could also opt to go your own way. I recommend the latter.

"
10 april 2019,cancer,"How good are you at getting things done? That’s going to be a big question over the next four months! Jupiter has just gone retrograde in your house of efficiency.

Logical Mercury enters your success house on Wednesday, at which time you’ll gain clearer insight.

"
16 april 2019,cancer,"Details and information could be murky today. It’s not that others are trying to deceive you; it’s more like that have no clue what’s going on. No problem, because intelligent Mercury enters your house of ambition tomorrow. You’ll figure it all out in no time.

20 april 2019,cancer,"Are you well rested? I hope so, because the Sun is now in your house of hanging out with the tribe! The next four weeks are also well aspected for joining a charity, visiting online dating sites and networking to further your career. It just so happens that profits planet Venus zips into your house of goals, so other people will be instrumental in your path to attainment.

"
21 april 2019,cancer,"Your desire to live a healthier, cleaner lifestyle will increase due to a positive lunar aspect. It’s time to stop making excuses and to take control of problems that may have been going on for far too long. An exercise or diet buddy is a good plan right now, someone who will hold you accountable….and who’ll suffer along with you on those workouts!

"
22 april 2019,cancer,"Keep your phone powered up and check your emails: a surprise text or call from someone could bring about a fabulous experience. The Sun and Uranus meet up in your house of friends, colleagues and networking. It’s also a smart move to be out and about; you never know who you might bump into.

"
23 april 2019,cancer,"A sudden surge of energy and inspiration could hit, prompting you to get more serious about your health and fitness. With lucky, healing Jupiter in a good angle, you could find just the right doctor, diet or protocol that will work wonders.

"
24 april 2019,cancer,"Fed up with being an enabler? Always being taken for granted in love? Then it’s time to reflect and take back some of your power, Cancer. Pluto starts to retrograde in your relationship sector, which will force you to get real. If it’s the other way around–you’re  the diva or difficult one–chances are you’re going to get a wakeup call.

"
25 april 2019,cancer,"Pluto just went retrograde in your partnership sector, and already you will be thinking about long term connections with people. One thing is certain: you need passion and plenty of it, in all areas of your life: love, work, travel, hobbies, you name it. Make sure you spend time with people who are just as passionate as you are.

"
26 april 2019,cancer,"Not everyone has your best interests at heart, something that may become obvious today. This could make you quite emotional, due to the Moon in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. Keep your cool, because this energy lasts a few days. With Mars in your house of inner work and pampering, why not pull away and take good care of yourself?

"
27 april 2019,cancer,"You don’t have all the facts about a certain situation or person, so don’t do anything just yet. Listening to the opinions of others will just make things worse—“too many chefs spoiling the sauce” so to speak. You need to rely on your own wisdom, but it will be off for a few days. Hold off.

"
28 april 2019,cancer,"You won’t be in the mood for anyone laying guilt trips or other crap on you today. Why should you be the dumping ground for other people’s nonsense? If need be, let them know that they can take their attitude somewhere else.

"
29 april 2019,cancer,"You are entering one of the most cathartic periods of your life when it comes to serious relationships. Last week Pluto, planet of personal power, went retrograde in this sector. Today Saturn does the same. In the weeks ahead you will be reviewing what you’ve done right and what you’ve done wrong in love. What lies ahead? Calmer, more mature relationships.

"
30 april 2019,cancer,"Screeeecchh!!  Throw on the brakes there, Cancer. A wicked Neptune-Mars-Moon aspect warns against diving into something too quickly. This could be anything: a dating situation, going to grad school, quitting the day job and starting a business, you name it. It’s not that you have to walk away from these things: just cool your jets a bit.

"
1 may 2019,cancer,"Your intuition is razor sharp thanks to Mars in the most hidden part of your chart. Use this to your advantage, as the red planet forms a terrific aspect with Mercury in your ambition sector. It’s the perfect day for dreaming big and then figuring out how you’ll pull off audacious plans.

"
2 may 2019,cancer,"Someone needs to be the grownup around here and it might as well be you. Yup, it looks like you’re going to be the voice of reason and serenity while everyone else whines and acts out. Fortunately this aspect doesn’t last long!

"
3 may 2019,cancer,"The right people, resources or routines may appear before you today. So if you’re smart, you’ll grab them! The good news is that interesting new people will continue to enter your life after this Saturday’s new moon in your house of networking.

"
4 may 2019,cancer,"A sparkling new Moon in Taurus can bring many exciting new people into your world, Cancer. Over the next six months you can have a lot of fun with the existing tribe and people you haven’t even met yet. Just be careful about getting too chummy with work colleagues. Associate with them, but don’t spill too much tea.

"
5 may 2019,cancer,"Stopping kidding yourself when it comes to health issues. The same goes for your fitness level. If you are overweight, out of shape and not glowing with health, it’s time to make a change. One of the smartest things that you can do right now is to find an exercise buddy and work out with them. Ask a friend to hold you accountable for brand-new habits that you’re going to develop.

"
6 may 2019,cancer,"You are in a fabulous place to meet new people, thanks to the recent new moon in your house of networking. And today lively, chatty Mercury glides into this sector. Over the next three weeks you could make some important new connections.

"
7 may 2019,cancer,"A partnership is just that: a place where opinions, feelings and responsibilities are shared. If you feel as though you are carrying too much weight, it’s time to let others know. This even includes your boss. There’s only so much that you should be expected to do.

"
8 may 2019,cancer,"Spontaneity is in the air, and it’s a perfect time for making last minute plans with friends. A terrific Mercury-Uranus aspect also recommends that you meet new people, so get out of the house and start mingling. With inspirational Neptune active in your multiculti house of new philosophy, some of the people you meet could be a real change form the usual.

"
9 may 2019,cancer,"Make sure that your own work is perfect, Cancer. A Venus-Jupiter trine demands accuracy and efficiency. Don’t sweat it if other people around you don’t have their sh** together. As long as your work shines, you will be able to impress the people who count.

"
10 may 2019,cancer,"People could be on head trips, exerting what they think  is their power. The smartest thing to do is to take a laid back approach. This is one battle that’s not worth fighting. With Venus in the most authoritative part of your chart, it appears that you’re really holding all of the cards.

"
11 may 2019,cancer,"People should be a heck of a lot more cooperative with a helpful Sun-Saturn trine. The next week is also an auspicious time for building stronger connections and meeting interesting new people. Other people could introduce you to a lover, potential employer or open your eyes to a brand new way of life.

"
12 may 2019,cancer,"Feeling glam or glum? If your appearance could use a bit of an update, then you have the cosmos’s permission to spend some money on yourself (yay!). Note that beauty-conscious Venus is in the house of fitness, so there will  be some effort needed on your part to complete the gorgeous package.

"
13 may 2019,cancer,"It’s a good time to get to the bottom of what’s really going on in a romance or group situation (which includes friends, volunteer organizations, work associates and so on). You need to know if you’re on the same page with these people. On Wednesday two planets move into houses that will help you align yourself with true soulmates, BFFs and colleagues.

"
14 may 2019,cancer,"Today is Mars’ last day in Gemini, your house of privacy and seclusion. Chances are you’ve been doing a lot of thinking about your birthday year ahead and what you’d like to manifest. Well get ready, Cancer, because tomorrow the red planet moves into your sign! Stop dreaming and start doing. Consider this as an early birthday gift from the cosmos.

"
15 may 2019,cancer,"Woo-hoo! Two planets make a move today and they’re heading to places that spell P-A-R-T-Y. Venus glides into the friendship and networking sector, and look-at-me Mars enters Cancer. A social time lies ahead, but not only with the tribe. You can use this lively energy to schmooze potential bosses and clients. Join a club or a team. Whatever you do, don’t stay at home.

"
16 may 2019,cancer,"You need cooperation and an open feeling within your relationships, Cancer. This is just as true at the office as it is in your personal life. Let others know that they have a responsibility to be honest and direct. If they can’t do that, then what are you doing with them?

"
17 may 2019,cancer,"Roles may need to be reassigned. Duties might have to be changed. The bottom line is that doing things the same old way just ain’t gonna work anymore. The good news is that optimistic Jupiter will help you streamline things and whip people into shape.

"
18 may 2019,cancer,"There is quite an interesting vibe going on in your chart! First there’s a full moon in your house of romance. This could spell the end of your days of being alone, if you’re single. Dating? Then you could get a lot more serious with your lover. Spunky Uranus is all fired up in your house of friends, so a BFF could make introductions. Or a platonic friend might want to be more than that!

"
19 may 2019,cancer,"The Sun is getting ready to enter your house of closure, where we toss people, habits and circumstances that aren’t working for us any longer. The cosmos recommends taking a look at people you consider to be friends. Are some of them snarky or unreliable? If so, it’s time for a change. Bring in new BFFs who support you.

"
20 may 2019,cancer,"Keep your eye on the ball, Cancer. Murky Neptune is going to try to throw you off track. Just take things one hour at a time, one task at a time. Aggressive Mars is in your sign, pushing you to go faster than you should!

"
21 may 2019,cancer,"Move over, John Edward. People of the Cancer persuasion are going to be the most psychic people on the planet over the next four weeks. That’s because the Sun AND mental Mercury just glided into their house of the subconscious mind. Dreams and gut hunches will increase and they will be downright prophetic. It’s also a great time to do some inner work.

"
22 may 2019,cancer,"Keep a loose schedule over the next few days! Unpredictable Uranus is active in your house of friends and networking, indicating that plans could change at the drop of a hat. People could call with invitations to have lunch or cocktails. They could play matchmaker and introduce you to someone new. A former co-worker might tip you off about a job opening. But you don’t have to wait to hear from them; make that call!

"
23 may 2019,cancer,"Uh, you may want to curb your enthusiasm today, Cancer. With aggressive mars in your sign you run the risk of coming on too strong. Furthermore, certain people may try to burst your bubble. Don’t give them that opportunity. Stick to your ideas and values but be a little discreet.

"
24 may 2019,cancer,"You may be tempted to give a friend or colleague the benefit of the doubt, but is that wise? You need to be operating with facts, not appearances or opinions. Fortunately the cosmic skies clear up tomorrow. Until then hold people to your expectations.

"
25 may 2019,cancer,"Sometimes you need to invest some money in yourself, and now is one of those times! I’m not referring to a new wardrobe or a night out on the town, although there’s nothing wrong with that. A better way to go is to spend money on your health, such as a gym membership or organic food. Work with a therapist to put issues behind you. You’re worth the investment.

"
26 may 2019,cancer,"With the Sun in the most secluded, healing part of your chart you may be craving rest. And it’s wise to take it. Your jangled nerves and weary body need a break. But another part of you desires success, the big kind. Recharge your batteries but don’t take your eyes off the end goal.

"
27 may 2019,cancer,"You are starting to realize that you are capable of so much more than you had previously thought. The North Node of the Moon is in Cancer,  and it governs who you are supposed to be in this lifetime. Inspirational Neptune forms a fabulous aspect with the Node, opening your eyes to fresh new possibilities concerning your life’s path.

"
28 may 2019,cancer,"A theme that is running through your chart this week is reality versus fantasy. Either the people around you are going to be floating around on a pink fluffy cloud, unable to see the world for what it is…..or it will be you! A Moon-Jupiter square indicates that people won’t be able to agree on a direction. They might slack off. Pay attention to this, because you may get stuck holding the ball.

"
29 may 2019,cancer,"A cosmic clusterf**k between Jupiter and Mercury could create a LOT of confusion today, Cancer. If anyone tells you that they have a gut feeling about something, and they swear that it’s 100% right, run the other way. Likewise, steer clear of people making big promises or who are planning world domination. Egos will be big and intuition will be off. Make sure that your head is on straight!

"
31 may 2019,cancer,"A dazzling Venus-Neptune aspect points the way to a much more flamboyant future for you. From your chart it appears that you’ve been playing it safe for far too long. One of the best things you can do is to find a role model, someone whose life you can emulate. Not that you want to be a cheap imitation of this person…but you can learn from them and develop your own exciting life story.

"
1 june 2019,cancer,"It takes team work to make the dream work, something you need to remind yourself about today. A Venus-Jupiter aspect recommends changing the way you handle things. It’s not that you’re difficult. It’s just that current situations in your life require more diplomacy.

"
2 june 2019,cancer,"Mercury will be entering your sign in a few days, and this will help you get a handle on what counts. Your thinking will become clearer and you’ll feel like expressing yourself as a result. Today is a good time to run things past people whose opinions you trust. Besides, joining forces with others is looking like a smart idea….start thinking about who should be on Team Cancer.

"
3 june 2019,cancer,"The new moon occurs in the most secretive, secluded part of your chart. The next few weeks are well aspected for pulling away from the crowd and recharging your batteries. Be choosy about whom you associate with. A happy Venus aspect recommends spending quality time with a lover and friends. However, tense Neptunian energy warns against sharing too much with colleagues or business connections.

"
4 june 2019,cancer,"Here’s an early birthday gift from the cosmos: Mercury enters Cancer today! Mars is there too, and these planets will act as a team to amp up your magnetism and further your interests. Just don’t get in everyone’s faces about what you want. Discretion and quiet behind-the-scenes action is the key.

"
6 june 2019,cancer,"The Moon is in Cancer and you are feeling friendlier than usual, even if you’re a social butterfly to begin with! Over the next few days you could meet some interesting new people (lovers included). Make plan with friends over the next 48 hours, and then get ready to power down a little bit. Once Venus changes signs on Saturday you’ll want some “alone time”.

"
7 june 2019,cancer,"Someone could surprise you with an offer of assistance. Don’t be afraid to reach out to a friend, mentor or colleague. Even if you just need someone’s opinion about a matter, ask for their input. They may be able to give you just the inspiration you need.

"
11 june 2019,cancer,"Rely on your own wisdom, especially at the office. If something seems off it probably is. Co-workers and clients could also be underestimating how long it’s going to take to do something, or how expensive it might be. Don’t confront people or try to explain the facts of life to them; eventually they’ll figure it out for themselves.

"
12 june 2019,cancer,"Take a step back from your life and make an assessment. Is this really the way you want to live? Are these the things you want to be doing? Do the people in your world fit? If not, be honest with yourself and head down another path.

"
13 june 2019,cancer,"It’s going to be hard to tell whether people are being straightforward or not. The best thing to do is to sit back and let them blather on. The less you say, the better. Eventually you’ll be able to figure them out.

"
14 june 2019,cancer,"Life is short, but you’re determined to squeeze as much out of it as you can. And why not? Neptune, planet of inspiration, is stirring up your desire to paint your life in bigger brushstrokes. If anyone is hemming you in though, you may lash out at them. Be careful not to make enemies of people whose help you may need.

"
15 june 2019,cancer,"Listen to the advice of others today, as they could shed some light on your situation. But in the end it all comes down to you. A Mercury-Moon aspect in Cancer will help you tap into your own wisdom. The Sun will soon be entering your sign, and you need to get clear about your next steps.

"
16 june 2019,cancer,"I feel sorry for anyone who tries to hem you in. With inspirational Neptune flying high in your house of adventure, you’re not going to listen to anyone  who tries to tell you that you can’t do something. Oh, and they’ll continue to do this as the week progresses….which means that you may need to put them in your place.

"
17 june 2019,cancer,"Clean up your act, Cancer. A full moon takes place in your house of productivity and getting things done. This is no time to have your head in the clouds, daydreaming. Keep it real. Besides, with the Sun entering your sign in a few days you shouldn’t be burdened with errands and work projects.

"
18 june 2019,cancer,"Sometimes other people need to have their eyes opened as to what’s going on. Or maybe they need someone to point out possibilities to them. You can be their guide in a positive way. With energetic Mars in your sign, your words have meaning.

"
19 june 2019,cancer,"Put up your dukes and fight? Aggressive Mars and mouthy Mercury are in your sign, and they won’t take kindly to anyone who tries to push you around. Things could get heated, especially with someone close. Wait until the Sun enters your sign before you deal with these people, if at all possible.

"
20 june 2019,cancer,"A friend or team member may do something unexpected, and it could create some turmoil. The Moon is in one of the most emotional parts of your chart and you might react without thinking things though. Your values may be different than someone else, which could be made apparent today. Keep calm and carry on as the Sun will soon be in your sign, brightening up your life!

"
21 june 2019,cancer,"Woo-hoo!!! The Sun enters Cancer, crowning your the favorite of the zodiac. But before you whip out ye olde bucket list and start planning your next adventure, know this: there will be a solar eclipse in your sign on July 3rd which could bring about fast-moving changes. And Neptune starts to retrograde today in your house of pushing past personal boundaries. This doesn’t mean that you’re stuck where you are; rather, you may be confused where to start. Take your time.

"
22 june 2019,cancer,"Life’s too short to play by the rules all the time. With the Moon in the most adventurous part of your chart, give yourself permission to loosen up a little and do things differently. A whopping solar eclipse will take place in Cancer on July 3rd, and you’ll have no choice but to live larger!

"
23 june 2019,cancer,"It may be difficult to get things out in the open today. Either you don’t feel like conversing or someone else is in that state. Whatever you do, don’t let your mind dream up wacky scenarios that may have no basis in reality. This goes for tomorrow too. Things will become more clear when Mercury changes signs on Wednesday.

"
24 june 2019,cancer,"A much more optimistic period is about to begin for you, but right now you may not be able to see that! It seems that worries are making you see the glass as being half full rather than half empty. You’re not stuck, something you’ll figure out tomorrow.

"
25 june 2019,cancer,"Some of your plans may need adjustment, and if you’re smart you’ll take care of that right away. The Sun is in your sign and you may be seeing nothing but green lights all around you. But you can only move in one direction at any given time.

"
27 june 2019,cancer,"Keep your schedule light over the next 48 hours, Cancer! Spontaneous Uranus is having some fun in your house of friends and networking. An offer to get together could come out of the blue. You could also meet new people who will play a part in your life for years to come.

"
28 june 2019,cancer,"Forging stronger bonds with people is the order of the day, thanks to a Moon-Saturn trine. But in order to do this you need to be a team player, open to the ideas and feelings off others. And they need to do the same. Next week’s solar eclipse in Cancer will open up a wonderful new chapter in relationships, but this may mean cutting off malcontents.

"
29 june 2019,cancer,"Need to increase your cash flow? Then it’s imperative to start mingling more with others. A Mercury-Moon aspect recommends getting the word out to a select few that you’re looking for a raise, new job, better clients, whatever. Attend industry events and try to hook up with a mentor too, even if it’s an online guru.

"
30 june 2019,cancer,"Don’t take on more than you can handle, Cancer. Right now it appears that you’re overly optimistic about what you can get done in 24 hours. An eclipse in your sign is arriving next week, and it will open new doors. So don’t get bogged down now in extraneous stuff that will tie you down.

"
1 july 2019,cancer,"Mars finally leaves your sign, which should help you settle down a bit. Ready to make more money? Good! The red planet is now in Leo, your house of making and saving more money. Notice the word “saving”. Don’t go crazy spending, as this is a side effect of hosting Mars in this part of your chart.

"
2 july 2019,cancer,"Your days of hiding in the shadows are over, Cancer. Glamorous, amorous Venus is getting ready to enter your sign, putting you front and center. This is a great time for pampering and a makeover, not to mention dazzling everyone with your presence!

"
3 july 2019,cancer,"Woo-hoo! A rollicking solar eclipse takes place in Cancer, which means that all of your fondest dreams are in the spotlight. Better yet is that Venus enters your sign today too, making you the most charismatic thing on two legs. But Saturn opposes this lunation, indicating that you won’t want to be hemmed in by anyone. If people aren’t giving you enough breathing room–or respect–then you may pack up your tent and head off into the sunset.

"
4 july 2019,cancer,"The recent solar eclipse in Cancer is setting you along a new path, one in which you’ll be more protective of your own needs and personal space. The Moon is still in your sign and it’s asking you to consider how “karmic” you think things are. Do you think, for example, that it’s your fate to settle for less? If that’s the case, you need to chuck that notion to the curb. Start expecting the best and it will come.

"
5 july 2019,cancer,"A productive Jupiter-Neptune aspect points the way to better habits and hacks. It may take awhile for these to become a daily part of your routine, but make an effort to incorporate them. Time and health are the most valuable assets we have. Protect your vitality and free up more happy hours.

"
6 july 2019,cancer,"This is a great weekend for getting out of town thanks to the Moon in your house of short distance travel. Don’t worry if you have to say closer to home; socializing and exploring your local neighborhood are also included. The more the merrier, so call your friends and make plans.

"
7 july 2019,cancer,"Your cash flow could slow down a bit now that Mercury is retrograde in your income sector. Job offers and raises might take awhile. Clients or prospects may be slow to respond. But the silver lining is that old deals from the past may return, and this time they’ll gel! That and the fact that this is over as of the 19th.

"
8 july 2019,cancer,"You should be sparkling with energy and charisma, thanks to lively Uranus forming a happy angle with magnetic Venus. This is not a day to worry about the problems of the world, your job or personal life. Just go out there and enjoy yourself.

"
9 july 2019,cancer,"No matter how badly you want to do things your way, it may not happen. A Saturn-Sun opposition pits your needs and plans against those of other people. You can fight this if you wish but you’re better off playing nice and cooperating, at least for the next 48 hours!

"
10 july 2019,cancer,"“The future’s so bright, I gotta wear shades!” That’s a line from a Timbuk 3 song (paging 1986, where are you?). But it perfectly describes what’s going on in your life at the moment. A fabulous Sun-Neptune trine kicks open doors that may have been shut and allows you to live in a bigger, bolder way.

"
11 july 2019,cancer,"People could be critical about the way you do things, but so what? Chances are they’re suffering from “group think” and they can’t see a bigger picture. This isn’t your problem, so let it go.

"
12 july 2019,cancer,"With luxury-loving Venus in your house of spending, you might be tempted to spend a little this weekend. And you should, provided that you can afford to! By the way, this doesn’t mean just designer clothes and swag. New golf clubs, a bike or hobby equipment counts too. It’s whatever makes you feel that you’re being good to yourself.

"
13 july 2019,cancer,"Your schedule should ease up a bit thanks to a Moon-Jupiter conjunction. And what if it hasn’t? Then take control of the situation and cut out some of your commitments and responsibilities, at least for the next few days. You need some down time.

"
14 july 2019,cancer,"You will be in no mood to take orders from anyone….but that doesn’t mean that they’re not going to try! By the way, this is a theme that has been running through your chart since the Cancer eclipse on July 3rd. If anyone gets too out of line your may give them their walking papers at the next  eclipse, which is on Tuesday.

"
15 july 2019,cancer,"Tension is mounting as the lunar eclipse in Capricorn arrives on Tuesday. This is a theme that has been going on in your chart all month, since the time of the Cancer eclipse on the 3rd: just how much of your personal power do you want to give away to others, especially a romantic partner? Today is a smart time to think about this as the Moon swings past Pluto and Saturn, planets that deal with maturity and strength.

"
16 july 2019,cancer,"How do you spell “cooperation”? I can tell you this—it’s not spelled me-me-me. That’s the message behind today’s lunar eclipse in your house of serious relationships. Many crabs will get engaged, meet The One or witness some kind of forward movement over the next few weeks. But if anyone is being pigheaded, it may be time to move on.

"
17 july 2019,cancer,"It may seem as though other people are holding all of the cards right now, and it’s possible that they do. So….you can choose to fight back, or be a wuss and let them walk all over you. Or, you can wait until tomorrow when cosmic aspects are working in your favor again. Can you wait 24 hours? Yeah, I thought so.

"
18 july 2019,cancer,"What a wonderful day to try something new! If you’re in a rut, you can bust out of it, thanks to an uplifting Venus-Neptune trine. This aspect bodes well for romance too. Be as flirty and sexy as you like. Trust me, you will be noticed.

"
19 july 2019,cancer,"This month has been a reflective time, intensely so. Two eclipses have forced you to examine your needs and biggest goals. Your relationships with others have gone under a microscope too. Now Mercury starts retrograding through Cancer, telling you to focus even more on what you need and want in your life. This energy lasts until the 31st, so make the most of it.

"
20 july 2019,cancer,"The Sun will soon be leaving your sign, which really is nothing to be upset about. Once El Sol enters Leo, things in your life may actually start to quite down and become more stable. Today is a smart time to consider the ways in which you give your personal power away to other people and situations that don’t deserve it! Do this before moving on.

"
21 july 2019,cancer,"This is the Sun’s last day in your sign, but it’s nothing to get upset about. On the contrary–El Sol forms a terrific aspect with Mercury in Cancer. It’s perfect for thinking about what you’d like to manifest in the next eleven months. Self image need an update? Then get to work on it, because once the Sun enters Leo, you’ll be on display and in demand.

"
22 july 2019,cancer,"The Sun is now in Leo, your money sector, and the action starts right away. Make sure your resume is up to date if you’re looking for a new gig. Start getting caught up on projects because you could land a promotion, new client or an additional source of revenue. The entire week ahead has good aspects that could increase your bottom line.

"
23 july 2019,cancer,"There is a lot of positive energy going on in your income sector right now, so make sure that you take advantage of it. Assertive Mars is in this sector and today it forms a harmonious trine with the Moon, indicating that career matters could go your way. Don’t be afraid to show a potential employer or client how passionate and talented you truly are.

"
24 july 2019,cancer,"The Sun may have left your sign, but Mercury and Venus haven’t! And today they line up in a perfect aspect called a conjunction, which fuses the energy of both planets. This is a wonderful time to revamp your self image, which isn’t just clothes and hair and makeup. It’s also about your attitude, what you think and what you say.

"
25 july 2019,cancer,"“Get outta my way!” That’s your mantra today as motivator Mars is hell bent on getting things done. This especially applies to getting organized and catching up on projects at home and at the office. Lucky, abundant Jupiter is pushing you as well, reminding you of how good it will feel to be on top of things.

"
26 july 2019,cancer,"Your life needs more structure, which is the message from the stars today. Strategic Mercury glides into your second house of ritual and creating strong foundations.

27 july 2019,cancer,"Cha-ching!! Yes, the lovely sound of cold, hard cash. The lovely smell and feel of Benjamins crisply stacked in your wallet (for my friends outside the US, a “Benjamin” is a $100 bill). Cancers are in one hell of a good place for scoring more dinero as profits planet Venus enters your money sector. It joins the Sun and Mars, creating a powerful trifecta. The next four weeks are awesome for finding new sources of income and building revenues.

"
28 july 2019,cancer,"Yesssss. You’re finally going to get your just rewards! The hard work you’ve been putting in is going to pay off, although you may have a hard time believing it.

"
29 july 2019,cancer,"Remember when Mom used to say—after you had done something stupid, or were considering a doofus move—“are you going to jump off a bridge because your friends want to?” Well Cancer, it’s that kind of a day. That cosmic Mom in the heavens is warning you to not follow the crowd. So if a friend, colleague or team member is trying to get you to go along with something, don’t. 

"
30 july 2019,cancer,"You may be anxious to move forward with something, but the cosmos recommends slowing down a bit. Think through your options and strategy. What’s wonderful is that better ideas and opportunities are about to come your way, so you should remain open and let them come in.

It’s a smart time to establish new routines and slow down a bit. This might mean pulling away from people, though, especially friends and work colleagues. Anyone who’s taking up too much of your time, or who brings extra (unneeded) drama, should be sidelined for awhile.

"
2 august 2019,cancer,"People may not be willing to stick to their roles or responsibilities today. Nor will they be interested in hearing advice from you. Your best bet is to walk away from this, because the mood changes in your favor next week. One message from the cosmos is clear though: you don’t have to put up with this nonsense. It’s time to step into a stronger position of power. Give it a few days.

"
3 august 2019,cancer,"Get your mind off your responsibilities and just have a good time this weekend. The Moon is in the most sociable part of your chart, telling you to cut loose.

4 august 2019,cancer,"Anyone who thinks that Cancers are scared sensitive types are in for one heck of a surprise! With the two most assertive planets in the solar system–Mars and Pluto–forming an alliance, you are stepping into a place of power and self confidence. By the way, it looks good on you.

"
5 august 2019,cancer,"When the Moon is in Libra, you tend to be more focused on inner comfort and routines than usual. But the Moon winks at saucy Neptune in the most free-spirited part of your chart, telling you to cut loose a little. Don’t forget, a month ago there was an eclipse in your sign, helping you do a 180. Often eclipses take four weeks to deliver their message. Are you ready?

"
6 august 2019,cancer,"No matter how much you want to get ahead, you’ll need the assistance of other people. The smartest thing that you can do right now is to cut the fluff and get right down to the facts. Playing the role of the dreamy creative type, or the bold visionary, isn’t going to work. Be as straightforward as possible, not only today but for the rest of the week.

"
7 august 2019,cancer,"Today and tomorrow are two of the best days in 2019 to put more cash in your pocket. In astrology, it’s when you initiate things that counts.

"
10 august 2019,cancer,"So many options…..but which one to choose? Inspirational Neptune is active in your house of thinking big and bold, which is great! But the logical Sun is over on the side saying, “Uh, okay—but you can only pick one or two of your bright ideas.” So do what El Sol says and narrow things down. Tomorrow some terrific aspects arrive that will help you chase after your dreams.

"
11 august 2019,cancer,"Career and money matters pick up steam, thanks to two glorious aspects happening today! Jupiter has been retrograde in your work sector, possibly bogging you down with too many details and paperwork.

"
15 august 2019,cancer,"The Aquarius full moon sets your sights on intimacy, steamy sex and deep emotional bonding. Do you have that in your relationship?

Once Mars moves into Virgo on Sunday you could meet someone locally, so get ready to sizzle.

"
16 august 2019,cancer,"People could be as erratic as hell today, acting in ways that you wouldn’t have expected.

"
20 august 2019,cancer,"When it comes to money rely on facts and logic, not emotions. All that glitters is not gold, so don’t go chasing after a shiny, sparkling new thing.

Planets are piled up in your third house of thinking, speaking and expressing yourself. Today a new moon occurs here, making it even more important to get your message out to people who need to hear it. But be prepared for resistance, as not everyone will accept your ideas and opinions.

Clients, co-workers or loved ones appear to be in an unproductive fog in which they can’t figure out how to put one foot in front of the other.

Stop burning the candle at both ends, Leo. You’ve been pushing hard, that’s for sure. But the planets are telling you to take a more balanced approach to your career and personal life. 

"
20 march 2019,leo,"
Yassss. Life starts to lighten up a bit, a nice gift on the equinox! Just as an equinox brings an equal amount of darkness and daylight to the world, so will your life begin to balance out. The last few months have been somewhat grueling, but now the Sun is in the most optimistic, adventurous part of your chart. Plan your next escapade.

"
21 march 2019,leo,"
The full moon speaks volumes as it’s in your house of communication. Something that you’ve been working on for awhile may get wrapped up: a contract, term paper, college application, social media campaign or art project. But this lunation could also represent the end to an old way of thinking and speaking, as you move on to a more eloquent place.

"
22 march 2019,leo,"
Everyone views you as being the fiercest cat in town, always ready to take on whatever life throws at you. But what many people don’t realize is that Leo is a fixed sign and that you don’t necessarily love change. Today’s a good time to examine what might be holding you back.

"
23 march 2019,leo,"
Now that Uranus is in your house of goals and ambition (for the first time in 80+ years, mind you) don’t be surprised if your head is spinning with genius ideas. After all, Uranus is the planet of revolution, novelty and technology. The problem is that you may resist some of things that you’re coming up with. That’s OK: it’s part of the process of thinking in a new, unique way. 

"
24 march 2019,leo,"
Yippee kiyay! It’s always a good day when both sides of your brain are working with each other (instead of fighting). Your logical left side is complementing the passionate, conceptual right side–in the houses of love and money, no less. It’s a good day for making decisions about your personal wealth and love life.

"
25 march 2019,leo,"
Start aiming higher, Leo! Your creativity is flourishing, and love can too. A Sun-Moon aspect will help you get out of a funk and into a happier place.

"
27 march 2019,leo,"You’ve been getting riled up lately, but there’s a silver lining to this cloud. Sometimes we can get so burned out about being angry that we shift over to a place where we just don’t give a sh** anymore, and that’s where you’re heading! Remember Rhett Butler at the end of Gone With the Wind?  “Frankly my dear, I don’t give a damn.” Uh-huh.

"
31 march 2019,leo,"It’s time for you to get out of your Leo lair and start shaking that mane of yours. Mars is now in your house of friends and networking, opening up a two month period in which you should be rubbing shoulders with other people. You can do this for fun, business or charity. Some of the people you meet could be quite adventurous, opening your eyes to a new way of living.

"
7 april 2019,leo,"Physical and mental health was so prized by ancient warrior traditions that these were focused on first in training. Where the body goes, the mind follows, so the sages said. And they were right. A fit body, honed by hours of disciplined work, leads to a resilient and clear mind. Make it your mantra to turn your body and psyche into a temple.

"
8 april 2019,leo,"You’ve never been one to shy away from a challenge. So what is holding you back now? With the the planets traveling through the most psychological part of your house this week, that’s a question you should ask yourself. Fear can hold back even the fiercest lion. Let it go and start to feel mighty again.

"
9 april 2019,leo,"All work and no play is going to make Leo a very boring lion indeed. Honey, you need some downtime! It may be a Tuesday, but that doesn’t mean you can’t plan for the upcoming weekend. Block out some relaxation time right now, otherwise it will slip through your fingers. And try to chill out today too.

"
10 april 2019,leo,"Leos are famous for being lovers of love, and lovers of life! Yours is the sign of artists, creativity, shopping, dining and enjoying the sweeter things….like amour. Jupiter goes retrograde today, which could slow down your desire for swag and romance. But it’s also a super time for developing your talent, so that you end up being more formidably skilled than everyone else.

"
11 april 2019,leo,"Ggrrr!!! Someone  is feeling sexy and confident. Really, is this a surprise? You are a sultry jungle cat, slinking along as you inspire awe in mere mortals on a regular day. But today the two most amorous planets in the solar system, Venus and Neptune, meet up in your house of libido and intimacy. Yum.

"
12 april 2019,leo,"Big dreams often cost money, but you are in no position to be spending large sums of cash. With abundant Jupiter retrograde in your house of luxury items, you need to go the budget route for now. It won’t kill you. With your Leonine creativity, you’ll be able to make inexpensive things look swanky.

"
13 april 2019,leo,"You just can’t keep doing things the same old way, but I think that you knew that. Pluto and Saturn are both in your house of habits and routines, desperate to make changes, but you are still glued to the past. Why are you being so stubborn, Leo? Are you going to learn or are you going to burn?

"
14 april 2019,leo,"Leos are famous for being the most creative sign of the zodiac, and a Sun-Jupiter aspect is perfect for exploring hobbies and artistic pursuits. If you want to make some money from your skills, pay attention: it’s quite possible under these friendly skies.

"
15 april 2019,leo,"If you’re surrounded by trolls and envious types, there’s only one thing to do: make them more miserable than they already are! Go ahead, live your best life and don’t worry if they’re angry about it. Take a page from the Meghan Markle play book–she’s a Leo.

"
16 april 2019,leo,"Financial and career matters could be vague, so don’t make any major moves today. The problem is that your emotions could get stirred up in the process. Take a deep breath and count to ten, Leo. The Sun moves into your ambition sector on Saturday.

"
17 april 2019,leo,"It really  is time to bust out of an old, tired groove. A series of planetary aspects between today and Saturday are going to kick you into high gear. Today mastermind Mercury glides into your house of taking chances and thinking big. Venus follows on Saturday, the same day that the Sun roars into your house of ambition and success. The sky is the limit, Leo.

"
18 april 2019,leo,"People will be opinionated as their egos expand to fill the room. Just let this get to you. In fact, just ignore it. It will piss ’em off even more. You have bigger things to think about, like tomorrow’s full moon. This lunation will shape your path for the rest of 2019.

"
19 april 2019,leo,"The annual full moon in your house of self expression asks this question: are you presenting yourself in the best possible light? Also, are you playing it too safe…or are you really ready to shine? The cosmos has this to say: shine on!! 
 
 

"
20 april 2019,leo,"Your motivation to succeed goes through the roof now that the Sun is in Taurus, your tenth house of ambition. This year you will be even more willing to take risks as Venus glides into your house of adventure today. This is not time to play it safe. Come on, you’re the fiercest sign of the zodiac.

"
21 april 2019,leo,"Not only is it time to develop your creative skills, it’s also time to go loud and proud about what you’ve already got! Don’t be shy about promoting yourself, Leo. The world id your stage and you need to be front and center.

"
22 april 2019,leo,"Today could be one of the most important days for you in 2019. That’s a bold statement, but it’s not everyday that the Sun conjuncts brilliant Uranus in your house of success. Either something that you’ve been working on scores big time, or you create plans that are off-the-charts amazing. Don’t let this important energy slip past you; own it.

"
23 april 2019,leo,"Heaven knows you’re a passionate creature, and you will feel especially charged up today! A luscious Moon-Jupiter meet-up will stoke your desire to experience even more love, fun and creativity in your life. A good thing, considering that grouchy Saturn and Pluto are telling you to make your bed, balance the checkbook and get caught up with work assignments.

"
24 april 2019,leo,"Sh**’s about to get real. For the past few months stern Saturn and subterranean Pluto have been telling you to get your act together. We’re talking habits, routines, your work flow, getting caught up on unfinished projects and being more efficient. Oh yes, diet and exercise are featured too. Well, Pluto goes retrograde here today, so if you’ve been ignoring him, he’ll let ya know. And did I mention that Saturn goes retrograde next week? You’ve been warned.

"
25 april 2019,leo,"Sometimes we fight change, especially if it’s something that we need to do within. But other times we’re like “Hell yeah, let’s do this!” Well Leo, it’s a hell-yeah kind of a day. Dive in and do what you need to do.

"
26 april 2019,leo,"Not everyone is going to be on board with your ideas or plans, but that’s no cause of getting all emo. Just let it ride. You seem to think that you owe it to others to give in or play by their rules. Nope. Do your own thing.

"
27 april 2019,leo,"This is definitely not the time to go with the flow and do things the way everyone else does them. If anything, you need to do just the opposite! But don’t try to force people to follow your example. They won’t, and that’s their loss.

"
28 april 2019,leo,"Nagging health issues have to go, Leo. It’s time for you to be brimming with vitality and be pain free, not to mention being taut and toned. But you may think that you’re “stuck this way”. Uh….no you’re not, so quit being a wimp and just get on with it already.

"
29 april 2019,leo,"“We’ve become what we repeatedly do.” So says Stephen Covey, the author of The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. I’ve got news for you, Leo: the cosmos and Stephen Covey are working hand-in-hand. Today mighty Saturn goes retrograde in your house of efficiency and routines. You can run, but you can’t hide. It’s time to clean up your habits once and for all.

"
30 april 2019,leo,"Friends and team members could be acting wonky today. Some may be slacking, others could be snippy, while some may be hard to pin down. This will be annoying as the Sun is highly motivating you to get things done, which also includes having fun! The mantra for today is: rely on yourself.

"
1 may 2019,leo,"This is one heck of a time to align yourself with movers and shakers, Leo. You’re thinking big thanks to intelligent Mercury in the most far sighted part of your chart. Now you need to find people who share your sense of adventure. This could be in real life or online. Listen to podcasts from internet experts who can show you the way ahead.

"
2 may 2019,leo,"Some people get so stuck in the same old routines that they can’t see a better way, even if it’s staring them in the face. Let’s hope this isn’t you. And if you find yourself surrounded by Luddites, take a deep breath and count to ten.

"
3 may 2019,leo,"Yes! A sizzling Mercury-Jupiter trine is just the ticket for adding more “juice” into your life, whatever that might mean to you: sex, adventure, love, creativity, travel, a new wardrobe, culture, you name it. With a new moon occurring tomorrow in your goals sector, you might want to add “live more boldly” to your list.

"
4 may 2019,leo,"Okay Leo, it’s time to get moving! Today the cosmos delivers your annual new Moon in the house of ambition and success. This one is different from those of the past in that brilliant Uranus, the planet of fabulous ideas, is now in this sector. The days for talking about things are over. It’s showtime.

"
5 may 2019,leo,"With abundant Jupiter in your house of beauty and creativity for the first time in over a decade, chances are you want to live a more gorgeous life. Nothing wrong with that! Just make sure that you’re doing this for you, not for other people. Trying to keep up with the Kardashians will just make you broke and frustrated. Be your authentic self.

"
6 may 2019,leo,"You are becoming more focused than a laser beam, Leo. The fiery Sun and Uranus, planet of genius, are in your house of goals, ambition and success. A new moon took place there a few days ago. And today shrewd Mercury zips into this sector. What can I say? You’re going to be like a steam roller. Nothing is going to get in your way.

"
7 may 2019,leo,"Pay attention to details, Leo. If you don’t, they’ll trip you up. You have magnificent planetary activity in the most ambitious part of your chart, and you’re thinking bigger than ever. But a stern Saturn-Venus aspect warns that at some point, you need to get down to the nitty gritty.

"
8 may 2019,leo,"Yaasss!! A wild and woolly Mercury-Uranus meet up puts rocket boosters on your plans for the future. These two brainiacs hold a powwow in your house of ambition and success. Considering that Uranus is the planet of genius and acts unexpectedly, just about anything can happen. Hope you’re ready!

"
9 may 2019,leo,"Don’t let anyone tell you that “it can’t be done.” With a bevy of planets inspiring you to take charge of your life and chase after your wildest dreams, no doubt there will be some naysayers in your midst. Heck, some of the doubts may even come from you. Let them go, because nothing is going to get in your way.

"
10 may 2019,leo,"People may try to take advantage of your cooperative, laid back manner. You’re in a visionary place these days, usually able to overlook infractions. But today they could push you to the point where you say, “enough is enough.”

"
11 may 2019,leo,"You should be feeling more strategic than a five-star general these days. The mighty Sun trines disciplined Saturn, a wonderful aspect for gaining control of all areas of your life. This is a theme that is going to run all throughout 2019, but the upcoming week is especially potent.

"
12 may 2019,leo,"It certainly is sweet to be you, Leo. With the Moon in your sign blowing kisses to charismatic Venus in the house of beauty and creativity, you are one magnetic creature. So head out the door and make everyone suffer as they witness your awesomeness. Of course, you already knew that you’re awesome, but it’s always nice when the cosmos backs it up.

"
13 may 2019,leo,"This is a super week for making progress with the items on your bucket list, whatever they might be. With the authoritative Sun in your house of ambition and determined Pluto kicking butt in your efficiency zone, momentum starts to build today and intensifies all week. I almost feel sorry for anyone who tries to slow you down.

"
14 may 2019,leo,"There’s an important saying which I think is true: “you become like the five people you associate with the most.” Considering that this is Mars’s last day in your house of friends and colleagues (and it won’t return for two years), it’s a good time to consider your circle. If the people in your world aren’t cooperative, or they disrespect you, it’s time to move on. But you’ll be doing this quietly; no big announcements will be made.

"
15 may 2019,leo,"Stealth aircraft is designed to move at fast speeds without being detected by conventional radar. And that’s what you’re going to become, Leo: a stealth warrior who leaves no tracks! That’s because Venus glides quietly into your house of ambition and success, while high octane Mars tiptoes into the house of secrecy. Seriously, you are going to become a force to contend with. Except that everyone around you will be clueless as to what you’re up to–for awhile, anyway.

"
16 may 2019,leo,"Don’t be surprised if you find yourself saying, “There’s got to be an easier way to do this.” With Pluto and Saturn retrograde in your house of becoming more efficient, you’re currently on a quest to streamline your life. Ask yourself this question: “what part of my life frustrates me the most?” Then figure out how to simplify and de-stress it.

"
17 may 2019,leo,"Let’s face it, we can get into ruts when it comes to having fun! If you’re stuck in the pizza and Netflix groove, for instance, why not bust out of it? Maybe you should try rock climbing or going to the science museum. Optimistic Jupiter is in a creative mood, ready to try anything. So should you.

"
18 may 2019,leo,"Some exciting energy is percolating below the surface, and it’s coming to a head. The full moon in Scorpio tonight will help wrap things up. Even though this lunation occurs in your domestic sector, your career and other big goals are highlighted. Eccentric Uranus could throw a happy surprise your way, and the end result will be contentment and a greater sense of security.

"
19 may 2019,leo,"From your chart it appears that you need to take much better care of your body, Leo. You need more sleep, a more disciplined exercise routine and less stress in your life. You’re about to enter a more social period very soon, one in which you’ll be meeting a lot of people. Recharge your batteries now.

"
20 may 2019,leo,"Your imagination may be getting the better of you, courtesy of a wonky North Node aspect. Stick with facts and figures and avoid speculation. If you need someone’s opinion, wait until the Sun enters your house of friends and mentors on Tuesday.

"
21 may 2019,leo,"They say that people make the world go round, which is news to Copernicus and Galileo but not to you! Today the fiery Sun and lively Mercury enter your eleventh house of friends and networking. Friends, acquaintances, club members and colleagues will be your key to success and enjoying life over the next month. Don’t be too proud to ask for help or advice if you need it, Leo. Mentors are all around you.

"
22 may 2019,leo,"Some interesting career news could come your way, and it has a hush-hush vibe to it. Maybe it’s the opportunity to interview for a job. Perhaps it’s industry intel that’s valuable. Or maybe you come up with an idea for an entrepreneurial venture. With energetic Mars active in the house of research and secrecy, dive right in.

"
23 may 2019,leo,"Don’t rush in where angels fear to tread, Leo! Use your Spidey sense to determine if a particular plan, idea or person is worth it, but don’t take action just yet. Besides, old fears from the past could crop up which will make you question yourself. It’s a mixed up day of aggression and fear, which means that it’s NOT a good time to make any decisions.

"
24 may 2019,leo,"Give someone an inch, and they’ll take a mile? It could happen today, Leo. Unless you want to get dumped on, set up some boundaries. If not, people will be all too willing to let you do all the heavy lifting. Let them do their own fair share for once.

"
25 may 2019,leo,"Jupiter is in the most creative, romantic part of your chart—-and it’s practically screaming at you to have more fun! It winks at the Moon in your house of serious love, so if you have a partner, then make this a special weekend. If you don’t, you could meet someone who’s a keeper.

"
26 may 2019,leo,"It’s critical to be around people who share your values, Leo. A Sun-Chiron aspect encourages you to spend more time with people who are forward thinking. A wise man once said, in a nautical metaphor, that people are either anchors or motors. They can pull you down or propel you forward. Make the right choice.

"
27 may 2019,leo,"Everyone thinks that Leos are slinky, feline and sexy. What they fail to realize is that you can suffer from self-image problems just as much as anyone else. That may have been happening lately, due to some dicey cosmic energy. But an inspirational Neptune aspect helps put you back on course: fierce, independent and full of life. Oh, and sexy too!

"
28 may 2019,leo,"It may be hard to see the good in people today, Leo. With the Moon in Pisces, you may be more emotional than usual. On the other hand, you may be dead-on accurate: these people could be downright scum! But is it worth getting all worked up about it? Don’t you have better things to worry about?

"
29 may 2019,leo,"Just because someone is a trusted friend or colleague doesn’t mean that they need to know every bloody thing about your life, Leo. Nor do you need to know everything about them. Balance is needed right now within your relationships. You have enough of your own drama to deal with; you don’t need to indulge in anyone else’s.

"
30 may 2019,leo,"Leos love the luxe life, there’s no doubt about that. But according to your chart you need to rein in your spending. A good way to go is to adopt the principle of minimalism: buy and own very little, but make sure it’s top quality and chic. That way you still keep that regal mojo going without being broke.

"
31 may 2019,leo,"Things that seemed impossible not too long ago are somehow looking a lot more real, Leo! A lovely Venus-Neptune trine is inspiring you to take another look at what you think you’re capable of. Two upcoming eclipses in July will shake you out of the past and into a new future. Start getting ready now.

"
1 june 2019,leo,"Self assurance is an attractive quality, and it’s time for you to develop more of it. Recent events may have made you feel like more of an alley cat than a fierce feline. But with charismatic Venus in your house of authority, you’re starting to get your old mojo back. Hallelujah.

"
2 june 2019,leo,"You’re on the verge of making a major decision about your life’s path, Leo. This could be in any area. The good news is that transformative Pluto and mature Saturn are doubling down in the most practical part of your chart, so the choices you make will be good ones. You deserve to live a more beautiful life, something that you’re starting to realize.

"
3 june 2019,leo,"You’re entering into quite an independent period, one in which you’ll be carefully selecting who you associate with. The new moon occurs in your house of friends and networking. Usually this kind of lunation makes you want to hang out with everyone and just enjoy life. But this year a Saturn-Venus trine indicates that you will only be letting practical, drama-free people into your circle. Jealous frenemies and divas need not apply.

"
4 june 2019,leo,"Sshhh!! Shrewd Mercury is now in your twelfth house of intuition and secrecy. Zip your lips and say as little as possible, even to people you trust. Red hot Mars also happens to be in this sector, and that blabbermouth has a hard time keeping its mouth shut. But it’s imperative to do so. Instead, do as much behind the scenes research as possible. The next three weeks are also awesome for doing inner work.

"
5 june 2019,leo,"Your mind could be way  too overactive today, courtesy of high octane Mars lining up with the passionate Moon. Your subconscious mind could stir up all sorts of wacky stuff, some of which may be based on reality and some not. Wait til Friday to act on any psychic hits you receive or decisions you need to make.

"
6 june 2019,leo,"Your sign is quite familiar with the idea of wielding power quietly. The other signs may think that you’re flamboyant and always showing off how fierce you are. But they forget that a cat like you likes to stalk its prey, remaining hidden in the shadows until the time is right….and then you pounce. It’s that kind of a day, Leo! Stay low to the ground, say little and just observe.

"
7 june 2019,leo,"Your confidence gets a boost as sparkling Uranus sends some mojo your way. This is a smart time to use both sides of your brain: the logical left side and the conceptual right. They’re both working together (instead of fighting) so you’ll be able to feel good about yourself and life in general.

"
11 june 2019,leo,"They say that flattery will get you everywhere, but is that really true? Uh, from your chart the answer is no, at least for the next 48 hours. So be wary if people are kissing up too much. And don’t go down that brown nosing path yourself.

"
12 june 2019,leo,"Tap into your intuition today, that mystical source of wisdom. From your chart it appears that you need some down time. There are plenty of people around you who can and will proc=vide sage advice, but right now it needs to come from within.

"
13 june 2019,leo,"Make sure that you pitch in and help, even if you don’t feel like it! A Sun-Pluto aspect promises that if you do, it will come back to you. People need to know that you’re willing to be a team player. This is a recurring theme in your chart over the next few months, so get used to it.

"
14 june 2019,leo,"Things are looking up for you but you can’t really see it. You’re so bogged down in your day to day reality that some of the passion for living has left you. Don’t worry–good times lie ahead. When the full moon arrives on Monday you’ll start to feel lighter.

"
15 june 2019,leo,"You are on the verge of physical and mental burnout, and you simply can’t keep pushing yourself like this. All the more reason to kick back and relax this weekend. But taking a day off here and there won’t be enough: you need some serious R&R, something that the July 3rd eclipse will help you do.

"
16 june 2019,leo,"Leave your cares behind, Leo. You are a fixed sign. As a result you can dig into a problem like a lion tearing a zebra apart for dinner. And then you can chew on the damn bones for a few days. Let things go. Otherwise your health will be negatively impacted. Namaste!

"
17 june 2019,leo,"It’s time to stop diddling around and wrap up a creative project if some kind. And while you’re at it, you need to figure out what’s going on in your love life. A full moon occurs in your house of romance and talent, but foggy Neptune is making things way too nebulous. When the Sun enters cancer this Friday your intuition will provide you with the insight you need.

"
18 june 2019,leo,"Your Spidey sense is right on target today, but you’re in a practical mood as well. So take those psychic hits and run with them. Tomorrow the mood changes quite a bit, so seize the moment.

"
19 june 2019,leo,"It could be harder than hell to keep your mouth shut as people will be playing head games and trying to push others around. It’s a “take a deep breath and count to ten” kind of a day, Leo. Your intuition could be off too, so don’t even think of relying on it. But once the Sun rolls into cancer on Friday, your psychic skills will increase, and you’ll be able to put trolls in their place.

"
20 june 2019,leo,"Someone might have on their bossy pants, and it could come as a surprise. Hey, it could be you who decides to fight back against something or someone that’s annoying you! However, you might want to hold off until next Wednesday, when loquacious Mercury enters Leo. 

"
21 june 2019,leo,"Leo, you are entering one of the most cleansing, transformative periods of your life. The Sun enters Cancer, the most psychological part of your chart. Neptune starts to retrograde in Pisces, yet another sector that governs your mental well being. Over the next four weeks your thoughts, feelings and habits will go under a cosmic microscope. Get ready to do some serious inner work.

"
22 june 2019,leo,"Yum. The weekend is looking steamy and passionate thanks to the Moon in Pisces. Sure, you could spend the weekend in the boudoir. But this is also your house of the occult! Maybe it’s time for a psychic reading or a session with a shaman.

"
23 june 2019,leo,"Loved ones could be flaky as hell, not being able to make up their minds about the simplest things. There could also be some petty disagreements and jealousy going on. Don’t sweat it; this is a temporary cosmic storm which will be over within 48 hours. When Mercury enters Leo on Wednesday you’ll be able to talk to these people and get to the bottom of things.

"
24 june 2019,leo,"Your emotions could be going all over the place, and as a result it could be hard to make decisions. There could be a lot of good options out there, and you may not be able to see them due to your brain fog. Clear that up and you’ll be in a much better spot.

"
25 june 2019,leo,"A Moon-Chiron aspect may be shaking up your confidence, but this won’t last long. Recent events have made you wait sensitive and wary. Once strategic, logical Mercury enters your sign tomorrow, you’ll feel that old mojo coming back!

"
27 june 2019,leo,"Some surprising career news could come your way, and this is a good thing. Your track record speaks for itself and people have taken notice. This energy carries into the weekend so be ready to show off your talent.

"
28 june 2019,leo,"Maintain some balance between all of your responsibilities and activities, Leo. An eclipse is coming next week that will test the limits of your physical and emotional health. If you’re overdoing things, the cosmos os going to deliver a wakeup call.

"
29 june 2019,leo,"You may be used to impressing others with your fierce attitude and refusal to settle for less. After all, you are the king or queen of the jungle! But today you’ll be able to dazzle others with your logic and ideas. Don’t be afraid to show the world this side of your persona.

"
30 june 2019,leo,"A friend or lover may be heading down a path that’s not right for them. Speak to them about this, even if they don’t seem to welcome your opinion. Eventually they will realize that you were right, and that you had their back.

"
1 july 2019,leo,"Yeah, baby! Leo season is three weeks away but the cosmos is starting the party early. Mars rolls into your sign today, getting you charged up and focused on your deepest desires. Intelligent Mercury is already there, so start creating that bucket list for the year ahead.

"
2 july 2019,leo,"Feeling like a sexy secret agent? Or maybe you feel the energy of a mystical Taoist warrior-monk. Perhaps you’re ready to pull away from people and quietly plan your next coup. Blame it all on Venus, which is entering the most secretive part of your chart. Sshhh!!

"
3 july 2019,leo,"Some seriously big things are happening behind closed doors, Leo. I’m referring to the inner sanctum of your mind, which is bolted shut so that the outside world can’t get in. A powerful solar eclipse in Cancer is telling you to stop, slow down and reconsider all the aspects of your life. If anything or anyone is making you unhappy, then get out the pruning shears and start cutting. It may be painful, but so is living a life that isn’t authentic.

"
4 july 2019,leo,"Releasing the past and any negativity that currently exists in your life is not an easy task. That’s what yesterday’s solar eclipse was all about, and today you might be feeling out of sorts. It’s not your karma to deal with crappy emotions, people and situations, Leo. The sooner you realize that the faster you’ll be able to move on and feel better.

"
5 july 2019,leo,"Yaasss! The Moon is in Leo and it’s time to have some fun. Optimistic Jupiter is smiling from your house of creativity, telling you to try something different when it comes to relaxing and enjoying life. Sometimes we get into ruts when it comes to our “playtime”. Get out of the old sandbox and into a new one.

"
6 july 2019,leo,"Mercury is going to go retrograde tomorrow in your sign, which means that you’ll have a lot of thinking to do over the next two weeks. Today is a smart time to consider your habits and routines as the Moon is in organized Virgo.   You’re going to need a strong foundation in the months ahead. Might as well start now.

"
7 july 2019,leo,"Your birthday season is not far off, and Mars and Mercury are already in Leo. This is great for motivation and thinking things through. It just so happens that Mercury begins to retrograde today, a situation that will last through the 19th. Use this energy to rethink your plans. Have your values changed? You’re going through an amazingly metamorphic chapter, and your idea of what’s important could be altered dramatically.

"
8 july 2019,leo,"There are changes afoot with your career, and you may be torn between two (or more) paths. One of the best things that you can do is to use your intuition for guidance. This will mean quieting your mind through meditation or a long walk in nature. A good psychic could also provide you with guidance.

"
9 july 2019,leo,"You could find yourself in a situation in which things simply aren’t adding up. Don’t drive yourself crazy trying to figure it all out, because that won’t happen today. But by Thursday things should become crystal clear.

"
10 july 2019,leo,"You could be highly inspired to take better care of your inner world, Leo. Your sign is famous for being image-conscious but there’s more to life than that. Do whatever it takes to heal your psyche and become more balanced.

"
11 july 2019,leo,"You’re tired of feeling like other people are in control of your life and you may rebel. This is your choice, of course. But with so much planetary energy going on in your confidential twelfth house, you could also pull away and plot your escape!

"
12 july 2019,leo,"Oohhh, what a luscious weekend you have ahead! Glam Venus is in Leo and it winks at the passionate Moon. This is a great time for shopping and pampering yourself. It’s also well suited for socializing, flirting and going out on the town. Enjoy.

"
13 july 2019,leo,"A lucky meeting of the Moon and Jupiter could bring a happy event in romance. Creative projects also soar, to the point where you might think that things are happening too easily. Listen, not everything in life has to take forever or be full of angst. Some times they just flow….and you deserve that.

"
14 july 2019,leo,"Playing by the rules may sound like a good plan, and no doubt other people want you to believe that. But do you think that it’s going to take you where you want to go? Don’t be afraid to break a few expectations that others have. They’ll survive, trust me, and you’ll be a heck of a lot happier.

"
15 july 2019,leo,"Just one more PUSH!! Yeah, that’s right….give something you’ve been working on a little more muscle today. That’s because tomorrow’s lunar eclipse occurs in your ultra efficient house of getting things done. Today the passionate Moon is in a great position to help you hammer out those last few things that need to happen. Then get a bottle of bubbly, because you deserve to celebrate your hard work.

"
16 july 2019,leo,"The big theme for Leos this month is bringing things to an end: health issues, toxic relationships or jobs, procrastination, sloppy habits, all of the things that make us feel off balance. Today’s lunar eclipse is the wrap-up to what may have been lots of effort on your part to get your act together. Kudos! Make sure you lock in new habits and routines, though—old unproductive ones die hard.

"
17 july 2019,leo,"Yesterday’s lunar eclipse was all about creating better habits and systems that will make you more efficient. Problem is, Venus–the planet that likes to take the easy route–is whispering in your ear that it’s OK to keep doing things the same old way. No, it’s not! Hey, that’s how procrastination works. Take things one day at a time and you’ll see improvement.

"
18 july 2019,leo,"It’s a sexy, sultry day, a good time to get in touch with your inner lioness or lion! With glamorous Venus and amorous Neptune in fine form, it’s also wonderful for pampering and canoodling. Go ahead, indulge yourself.

"
19 july 2019,leo,"You’re such a fierce and proud individual that many people assume you’ve got your mental act together, 100%! The reality is that you have fears, sorrows and negative thought patterns, just like everyone else. Mercury retrogrades into the most psychological part of your chart today, encouraging you to “take a look under the hood”, as it were. Probe the corners of your mind for weaknesses and root them out. Your birthday season starts in a few days; it’s time to feel lighter and happier.

"
20 july 2019,leo,"Deep down inside you know that things need to change. So why are you fighting it? Uh, maybe it’s the Venus-Pluto opposition in the heavens. Venus likes to take the easy route, whereas Pluto takes a scorched earth, take-no-prisoners path. Somewhere in between there has  to be a happy medium. Find it and start your journey.

"
21 july 2019,leo,"OK Leo, in 24 hours the Sun will be in your sign and the party can start. But for now you need to do one last thing, and it’s important. The authoritative Sun and intelligent Mercury line up perfectly in your house of closure and transition. Commit to walking away from situations and people that may be bringing you down. Decide to make a daily habit of performing the kind of inner work that will bring you peace and comfort. Namaste.

"
22 july 2019,leo,"YAASSSS!!!! Your birthday season is officially here as the Sun enters Leo. Truth be told, the past year hasn’t been an easy one. But you can make up for it, as high octane Mars is already in your sign and Venus arrives this Saturday. There is a determination about you that is unstoppable, and people around you sense it. You are so  ready to leave the past behind, so whip out the bucket list and write down some new adventures to embark upon!

"
23 july 2019,leo,"Your birthday season starts off with a bang! Red hot Mars is in Leo and it forms a terrific aspect with the Moon, which is in the most adventurous part of your chart. What can I say? It seems that the cosmos is encouraging you to take some chances and live a bolder lifestyle. You’re a fixed sign, which means that change doesn’t always come easy. But once Venus enters Leo this weekend, things will flow.

"
24 july 2019,leo,"Ready, set……stop? The Sun just entered your sign 48 hours ago and no doubt you’re ready to rumble. But Venus and Mercury decide to hold a secret meeting in the most hush-hush, thoughtful part of your chart. So don’t feel bad about pulling away and spending some time alone as you ponder what to do next, or who you want to be. There is a strong cosmic push urging you to be authentic in all areas of your life.

"
25 july 2019,leo,"You are entering an incredibly creative and fun-loving phase, Leo! Yes, the Sun just entered your sign the other day, but that’s not the only reason why things look so enticing. Red hot Mars is in Leo too, and today it forms a fabulous aspect with abundant Jupiter in your house of enjoying life. You’ve been toiling away in the shadows for too long. Live a little!

"
26 july 2019,leo,"YAY!! Lively Mercury is now in Leo, and this is a good thing. You have a lot  of thinking to do about your future, probably more than you’ve had before in your adult life. Start contemplating what your next moves will be as there is a game changing solar eclipse arriving on July 3rd.

"
27 july 2019,leo,"Oh, the good news just keeps on coming for lions. The Sun entered Leo a few days ago, joining gung-ho Mars. And today luscious Venus joins them. It’s always a good thing when Venus is in your birth sign because it sets the stage for creating a brand new image. Remember how the Cowardly Lion got all dolled up when he reached the Emerald City? It’s time for you to revamp your look.

"
28 july 2019,leo,"The Sun, Mars and Venus are all in Leo and they’re acting like a team of cheerleaders. ” 1 2 3 4, let me hear you stomp the floor! 5 6 7 8, Leo’s here and she can’t wait!” Yup, it’s birthday season and there’s nothing holding you back. Even Chiron, the Wounded Healer, is in the mix, telling you to stop selling yourself short.
 
 

"
29 july 2019,leo,"The Sun is in your sign and you’re feeling fine. So fine, in fact, that you won’t feel like taking crap from anybody. But that doesn’t mean that everyone is on Team Leo.  A boss, client, authority figure or a smug wannabe may try to burst your shiny red balloon. Don’t let this upset the balance of your precious chi. Shake that mane and sashay off into the sunset instead.

"
30 july 2019,leo,"Not everything is going to make sense today, and that’s OK. Murky Neptune is stirring up the waters of your subconscious mind. The blue planet is helping you wash out old emotions and thoughts that no longer need to be there. So don’t be surprised if random memories and feelings crop up; they’re on the way out!

"
31 july 2019,leo,"What excellent timing! Sometimes the cosmos sends us aspects at the worst possible moment, but in your case it’s just the opposite. Mercury goes direct today in the house of your subconscious mind, which is terrific. You’ve had a lot of mental junk to release so that you can move on with your life. Then tomorrow there’s a new moon in Leo…your annual opportunity to start anew!

"
1 august 2019,leo,"The Leo new moon finally arrives, kicking off a luscious six-month phase in which you can chase after your  dreams. It’s also the best time in 2019 to reinvent your image. But in doing so you may come to realize that some of your previous goals or desires just don’t suit you anymore. A big career change is also a strong possibility. It may be uncomfortable at first to move forward, but nothing ventured, nothing gained!

"
2 august 2019,leo,"Yesterday’s new moon in Leo is opening your mind to fresh possibilities that you may not have considered before. This could be refreshing (“Wow! What a great idea!”) or it could be a bit uncomfortable (“maybe my previous ideas weren’t the best for me”). Change takes courage, my friend, but no other sign of the zodiac has your chutzpah. Next week momentum starts to build….whether you’re ready or not!

"
3 august 2019,leo,"With so much planetary activity in the most creative and fun-loving parts of your chart, chances are you don’t know where to start. So many options….so little time! Fortunately the Moon enters structured Virgo, helping you prioritize. So get out the Birthday Bucket List and pick your top five. Once Wednesday rolls around you’ll be raring to go.

"
4 august 2019,leo,"“Either lead, follow or get out of my way!”  That could easily be your battle cry as aggressive Mars fires you up today. People ought to be listening to you too. Because you’re going to charge ahead with a course of action whether they like it or not. Don’t feel guilty about leaving them in the dust.

"
5 august 2019,leo,"The Moon is in the chattiest part of your chart, which means that you can talk to just about anyone. This includes your writing skills too. Just soften your tone a little bit and play up to people’s emotions. Logic is not as important today as giving people the #feels.

"
6 august 2019,leo,"Your status in the world is changing. People are starting to view you in a new light. The odd thing is, you may not even realize it yet. Don’t sell yourself short, Leo. Don’t be afraid to be fabulous and funny and magnetic!

"
7 august 2019,leo,"Gotta love today’s planetary aspects! The Sun is in your sign, making you fiery and charismatic. El Sol winks at lucky Jupiter in your house of romance and creativity. The energy is fabulous for dazzling suitors, employers, fans and all those wannabes out there. It’s also a great day for having FUN. Remember what “fun” is? I think you need a refresher, so go out and find it.

"
8 august 2019,leo,"The future is so bright, you have to wear shades! That’s the vibe with today’s fabulous Venus-Sun trine. Everything is poised to work out for the best, so if you’re not feeling optimistic, snap out of it.  With lucky Jupiter active in the most creative part of your chart, you’ll be able to find a solution to whatever may be perplexing you. FYI: romance sizzles with these two planets in action.

"
9 august 2019,leo,"Anything is possible for you, Leo. The Sun, Mars and Venus are all in your sign, providing you with confidence and charisma. But Saturn, planet of kudos and rewards, also has your back. The ringed planet is helping you to create the structure and discipline you need. All of this adds up to a pretty sweet, solid situation!

"
10 august 2019,leo,"Stop playing down your abilities, Leo. And don’t be afraid to let your personality shine either. Even though the Sun is in your sign, you may still feel a bit subdued. Do the inner work necessary that will help you feel glorious. You are  fabulous, and it’s high time that you accept it!

"
11 august 2019,leo,"Here’s a sweet birthday gift from the cosmos! Jupiter finally goes direct in your house of love, after several months of being asleep on the job. Your creativity will soar and there will be more time for having fun too. By the way, magnetic Mercury enters Leo today, perfect for updating your image. And Uranus starts to retrograde in your house of goals, which actually is a blessing. It will stop you from jumping all over the place with ideas. Focus is the key.

"
12 august 2019,leo,"Call it “Motivated Monday”, because that’s the kind of energy your sign has going on right now. You’re going to be inspired to catch up on loose ends, and this is a good plan. Planetary aspects later this week call for fun and romance. Get rid of the grunt work now so that you can play later.

"
13 august 2019,leo,"An independent streak is rearing its head, making you crave autonomy. And is that so bad? Others might get a little bent out of shape, but they’ll get over it. Right now you need to pursue your own agenda, not to mention some personal down time.

"
14 august 2019,leo,"“Damn, I’m good! The future’s so bright, I have to wear shades.” That’s the kind of upbeat attitude you could have today Leo, and you deserve it. The fiery Sun, your ruler, meets up with glamorous Venus in your sign. There’s nothing wrong with looking good and feeling good, and hell—showing it off too! So venture out and enjoy yourself. It’s a birthday gift from the cosmos.

"
15 august 2019,leo,"Who’s on Team Leo? That’s the question raised by the Aquarius full moon. Aquarius is your opposite sign, the house that deals with close personal relationships. You could solidify situations with people (like getting engaged or entering into a business alliance). But you could also walk away from situations in which you’re doing all of the giving and not getting anything back. The decision is yours to make.

"
16 august 2019,leo,"Don’t let criticism from others throw you off your game, Leo–even if it comes from higher up. With intelligent Mercury active in your sign, you know what’s going on. Which may precisely be why others are in a snit: they know that you’re right. Don’t rub their noses in it as this will only make things worse. Just smile sweetly and go about your day.

"
17 august 2019,leo,"Duty calls and you may be saying “screw you!” Yup, you won’t feel like doing anything today that smacks of discipline and hard work. My advice is to relax and have some fun this weekend. Do it now, because next week Mars moves into one of the most structured, hard-working parts of your chart.

"
18 august 2019,leo,"Show me the money, honey! That’s your new battle cry as motivator Mars barrels into your house of cash. A word of warning here: the tendency to overspend is always an issue with Mars in this sector, so be careful. But you can also make enormous strides when it comes to landing a higher paying job or starting a business of your own. Venus, planet of profits, and the Sun arrive later this week. Get ready for a busy month ahead.

"
19 august 2019,leo,"The Sun will be leaving your sign in a few days, but that’s nothing to get upset about. An inspirational Moon-Mercury aspect opens your mind to fresh possibilities for the next year, things that you may not have considered before. The purpose of being on Earth is to grow as a person. Are you ready to try some new things?

"
20 august 2019,leo,"Letting everyone know what’s going on may not be the smartest move right now, Leo. With so much planetary firepower in your sign you may feel as though you can’t go wrong. But discretion is needed right now. As for listening to other people’s opinions, avoid that as well. You have a good handle on things and don’t need distractions.

"
21 august 2019,leo,"You know deep inside that it’s time to take things up to the next level. Maybe it’s a romance or your career. Perhaps it’s your lifestyle. And you certainly don’t lack the smarts or courage to do so. What are you waiting for? Get on with it already!

"
22 august 2019,leo,"This is the Sun’s last day in your sign, and before it moves on it leaves a gift at your doorstep: inner peace. You’ve been doing a lot of work lately on your emotions. Truth be told, the work is not yet done. But you’ve made progress and will continue to do so, especially during the Virgo period. Greater serenity and mindfulness will  be yours.

"
23 august 2019,leo,"Get ready, Leo! You are entering into one of the most prosperous times I’ve ever seen in your chart. The Sun is now in Virgo, your second house of making and saving more money. Powerful forces are at work helping you to get ahead. Next week could bring some amazing events your way; make sure that you’re ready to talk about big bucks.

"
24 august 2019,leo,"Security never looked so sexy. A wonderful meet up of Mars and Venus in one of the most stable parts of your chart will set off sparks, Leo! Maybe you’ll meet a mature, grounded but soulful lover. Perhaps an engagement is coming your way. Even job prospects look firmer and more profitable. FYI: this energy only gets better in the weeks ahead.

"
25 august 2019,leo,"A powerful career and money phase opens up this week and continues well into September. Today Chiron, the Wounded Healer, asks where you’ve been playing it too safe. Leos are a fixed sign and don’t take to change too easily. But sitting on the sidelines watching everyone else live a bold life and crushing it isn’t your MO either.

"
26 august 2019,leo,"Confidence is sexy and do you ever have it today! A luscious Venus-Uranus aspect ratchets up your charisma, not only in romance but in business too. It ain’t easy being a show stopper but you were born for this level of adulation. Oh, and here’s the best part: it continues all week long. 

"
27 august 2019,leo,"Deadlines and responsibilities could feel like the 800-pound gorilla in the room right now. With the Moon in the most restful part of your chart, you probably just want to crawl into bed and take a nap! Hey, it you need rest take it, but just for today. Tomorrow things start to heat up as big plans of yours gain traction.

"
28 august 2019,leo,"Mars and Uranus are the two most energetic, assertive planets in the solar system. When they’re at war with each other it’s time to duck for cover. But when they’re in bromance mode–which is the case this week–you’re in luck. It just so happens that they’re active in your houses of making money career progress and  solidifying romance. It’s time to grab what’s rightfully yours!

"
29 august 2019,leo,"Money talks and right now it’s screaming at you, Leo! Shrewd Mercury has just joined the fiery Sun in your income sector. You should be doing whatever it takes to start pulling in more cash. There could be some unexpected surprises coming your way: an important person who believes in you, for instance, or hitting upon a genius idea. Focus more on increasing your cash flow than long term deals that could take forever to pull off.

"
30 august 2019,leo,"Yes! The Virgo new moon is all about making more money and enjoying success in your career. But what’s the best way to get ahead? Murky Neptune could be confusing matters, making it hard to see the path ahead. Take your time and don’t get frustrated. As long as you’re not expecting overnight success, you’ll know what to do by September 14th.

"
31 august 2019,leo,"Don’t beat yourself up if you can’t make up your mind about something. Funky Neptune is active in one of the most emotional parts of your chart. As a result a small battle is being between logic and feelings. If you can, avoid making major decisions today and hold off til next week, when things will become a lot clearer.

"
1 september 2019,leo,"Doing things the same old way will only get you more of what you’ve already got. In other words, things will stay the same. Is that what you want?! I didn’t think so. It’s time to be a bit more adventurous when it comes to major life goals, and this includes romance, career and travel. Fortunately logical Saturn is in a good place to help you come up with a realistic way to get things that may have seemed impossible.

"
2 september 2019,leo,"You are entering into a wonderful period in which you can build a lot of security in your life: financial, romantic and emotional, for starters. Your motivation level is high and you’re on the right track. Which is why you need to avoid people and situations that are too dramatic. It’s also critical to avoid fairyland type thinking. Keep it real and sane, and you’ll be fine.

"
3 september 2019,leo,"You are currently in one of the most practical phases your sign has seen in a long time, Leo. Reality counts. So do rituals, habits and systems that work. If anyone tries to tell you to “just go with the flow”, remind them that sewage flows though pipes. Otherwise just keep hammering away at the things that need your undivided attention.

"
4 september 2019,leo,"Don’t kid yourself about your finances, Leo. A Venus-Jupiter opposition could create confusion about a job, investments or cash flow. If you’re negotiating a job offer, mortgage, court award or anything else that has money attached, you need more facts—and they will be hard to come by today. Tomorrow and Friday are much better days for digging deep and getting the intel you need.

"
5 september 2019,leo,"It’s back to school time for the kids but your chart has the same kind of energy! It’s all about trying new methods, digging into projects and feeling good when you’ve finished something. This is true at work and at home, but also with your health and fitness levels. Anyone who thinks that you’re a lazy, languid lion is in for a shock.

"
6 september 2019,leo,"From your chart it appears that you’re overthinking. This happens a lot when we’re stressed, but it can also happen when we’re having fabulous daydreams (the realistic kind) about our future. Shut down your brain for a few days and forget about it. The answers will come more quickly if you just let them flow in effortlessly.

"
1 january 2019,virgo,"Welcome to a new year, a time when inner peace and contentment will count for a lot. With powerful planets lined up in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, you’re going to be craving stability in 2019. This is true especially within your family, romance and residential situation. Drama just isn’t going to cut it for you.

"
2 january 2019,virgo,"Let’s face it, sometimes you just have to be super rational when it comes to romance. It can’t be champagne and caviar all the time. The good news is that the two most logical orbs in the solar system, the Sun and Saturn, are meeting up in your house of love. It’s a great day for making serious decisions about the future. Likewise, if you’re single and looking, it’s a smart time to create a short list of the qualities that you simply must have been a mate.

"
3 january 2019,virgo,"Family members or a lover could be difficult today, and you may be wondering if you did anything to create this. Whether you did or didn’t, know that this little tempest in a teapot passes quickly. As a matter fact, it’s gone by tomorrow. Friday is a much better time for talking things over.

"
4 january 2019,virgo,"Woo-hoo! Things get juicy and fun as vivacious Mercury glides into your house of amour. This is just an appetizer for the big “meal”: a solar eclipse in this house next Monday. This sector also governs shopping, going out on the town, and creative pursuits. Enjoy.

"
5 january 2019,virgo,"Holding your thoughts and feelings back? You could be, as a result of a Chiron aspect. Chiron is known as the wounded healer, and when it’s activated it brings up stuff that’s deep within. The good news is that the lines of communication are starting to open, so don’t be afraid to speak up.

"
6 january 2019,virgo,"Love heats up big time thanks to two amazing cosmic aspects today. The first is a solar eclipse in your house of romance, fun and flirting. The second is the fact that Uranus goes direct in your house of sex and intimacy. Yowza! To say that the breaks are off is an understatement. Things can start happening at lightning like speed. Hope you’re ready.

"
7 january 2019,virgo,"Despite the fact that yesterday’s eclipse occurred in your house of flirtation and fun, you could be feeling more interested in tradition and security. That’s because Venus enters your domestic sector, making you crave a strong foundation….in addition to desiring the juicy stuff too!

"
8 january 2019,virgo,"Yikes! Emotions will be going all over the place today, either on your part or on the part of others. Be careful what you say and do, as you can end up feeding this fire and make it worse. Things improve tomorrow; wait 24 hours.

"
9 january 2019,virgo,"Something that has been bothering you may quickly dissipate. Not everything in your mind is (a) real or (b) worth getting worked up over.

"
10 january 2019,virgo,"Cooperation and commitment could increase under today’s productive lunar aspect. This is true in your personal life as well as your professional one. If you feel as though you need help with something, don’t be afraid to ask for it.

"
11 january 2019,virgo,"You are currently enjoying a lot of planetary activity and your fun, frisky fifth house of romance. There is a light-hearted air about this sector, which makes it perfect for flirting and partying. But a serious Pluto aspect today indicates that you need to get real when it comes to romance. Really real.

"
12 january 2019,virgo,"Sometimes you just have to let loose and follow your passions, and that’s what the cosmos wants you to do this weekend. You’ve been working hard and playing by the rules; now it’s time to do what makes your heart sing.

"
13 january 2019,virgo,"What really floats your boat, Virgo? Living a passionless life is no way to go. Consider what you can do to make your existence on this planet more exciting….without doing something stupid! (LOL)

"
14 january 2019,virgo,"The cosmos has been conspiring to help you develop your talent. Everyone has some kind of special ability, and it’s time for you to find yours. It wouldn’t hurt to team up with somebody else who is creative too. You could both learn from each other.

"
15 january 2019,virgo,"“Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all!” So said Helen Keller, who transcended her limits and lived an amazing life. With the Moon in your house of taking risks, this is an excellent time for pushing yourself past your own boundaries.

"
16 january 2019,virgo,"A Pluto-Sun meet-up in your house of romance and creativity could transform the way you view your talent level AND love life. Pretty neat, huh? But you won’t know unless you try. Fortunately the Moon is in the most adventurous part of your chart. Vamanos!

"
17 january 2019,virgo,"This may seem as though you can’t keep anybody happy today, Virgo. Let it go. By tomorrow your mood will improve and you won’t care what anyone thinks!

"
18 january 2019,virgo,"Want more love, juicier romantic moments and a happier lifestyle? Then you need to demand it, baby! Tough guy Pluto is telling you to stop waiting for your ship to come in. Swim out to meet it instead. Otherwise you’ll be waiting a long time.

"
19 january 2019,virgo,"
Be selective about whom you spend time with this weekend. Friends, family and lovers could be way too emo and erratic. Avoid known malcontents and stick with the saner people.

"
20 january 2019,virgo,"
The Sun is now in the most can-do part of your chart. But unless everyone around you happens to be a Virgo too, they won’t be jumping to get things done. Which means that you might have to do things by yourself….at least until Thursday, when you put them into place.

"
21 january 2019,virgo,"
Over the past two years you may have gone through a lot of changes, the kind that are deep within. It may not have been easy. But here’s some good news…a lunar eclipse in Leo brings this cycle to an end. Between now and the time of your birthday, you can experience a rebirth–mentally, emotionally and physically.

"
23 january 2019,virgo,"
Trying to talk sense to someone could backfire today, Virgo. On the flip side, someone may try to talk sense to you… and it will go nowhere! Fortunately this aspect will be gone within 24 hours. Intelligent Mercury glides into the most practical part of your chart tomorrow, so you’ll be clear and resolute.

14 june 2019,virgo,"Chances are you’re getting tired of listening to people who are factual and logical all of the time. “Play by the rules, do the right thing, stick to a routine”…..yada yada dada. Start spending more time with people who are more flexible in their philosophy. You might learn something from them.

"
15 june 2019,virgo,"Upcoming planetary events will force you to take a good long look at your closest relationships, from friends to lovers to colleagues. If anyone is making you feel uneasy, or like you’re not worth much, then it may be time to move on. It’s not your karma in life to be a doormat. Remember that.

"
16 june 2019,virgo,"Team efforts and friendships are well aspected today, so make the most of it. You may be faced with a choice: who do I spend time with this week? My tribe, my lover or business colleagues? If you’re smart you’ll do a little scheduling to make sure that everyone gets some time with you.

"
17 june 2019,virgo,"Home and family matters take center stage thanks to the full moon in your domestic sector. This house also governs love to a certain extent, especially if you are living with a lover or you’re married. There could be some confusion that makes your relationships with others a bit tense. Things get back on track when the Sun enters Cancer on Friday.

"
18 june 2019,virgo,"You may need to point out the facts of life to other people today. But don’t discount their ideas; there could be some real gems there. Pay even more attention to what others are saying after the Sun enters Cancer on Friday.

"
19 june 2019,virgo,"Unless you enjoy drama, try to steer clear of people who seem intent on stirring it up. A stinky Mars-Pluto opposition could bring out jealousy, disagreements and petty behavior, not to mention bossy behavior. Cosmic energy improves by the weekend, so ride out this storm and wait for fairer skies.

"
20 june 2019,virgo,"Be wary of sticking out from the crowd today, Virgo. No one is telling you to be a wimp or to take a lot of guff. But you’re better off keeping your mouth shut for the next 48 hours and going along with group think. 

"
21 june 2019,virgo,"An independent streak builds as the Sun enters Cancer, your house of networking and having fun with friends. If you’re involved in a romantic relationship, the desire to do your own thing could increase. Neptune starts retrograding in your commitment sector, which will only add to this sense of doing your own thing.

"
22 june 2019,virgo,"The Moon in Pisces will make you crave the company of others, so don’t spend the weekend alone. And make sure that you are present for the people you care about the most. Don’t let your job or other stressors get in the way of spending quality time with loved ones.

"
23 june 2019,virgo,"Subtle power plays could erupt between you and others, both at work and in your personal life. No matter how diplomatic you may be, people won’t budge. At least they probably won’t get in your face about it. Mercury will be entering the most perceptive part of your chart on Wednesday, at which point you’ll be able to sniff out what’s going on.

"
24 june 2019,virgo,"You can’t fit a square peg in a round hole, Virgo. So don’t even try to get people to do things your way, or to understand your side of things. Friday is a better time for expressing yourself as a Moon-Saturn trine will put everyone in a more open minded place.

"
25 june 2019,virgo,"No matter how much you may think you know someone, do you really? And while we’re on this conversation, just how well do you know yourself?  A probing Chiron aspect urges you to go within to find out. Maybe you need to meditate. Perhaps you should speak with a therapist. Or simply journaling may help. Find a modality that works for you.

"
26 june 2019,virgo,"” I see dead people!” OK, maybe you’re not going to see the spirit world, but now that Mercury is in the most psychic part of your chart you could get some interesting intuitive hits. Pay attention to these between now and July 7th, as they could provide you with wisdom.

"
28 june 2019,virgo,"You have permission to be happy, Virgo. Yes—the cosmos says that it’s perfectly OK to laugh, love and enjoy life. With an eclipse coming next week in the most outgoing part of your chart–the networking sector–you should be meeting some new people who will want to join you on your journey.

"
29 june 2019,virgo,"Your attitude should start to lighten up a little bit thanks to the Moon entering the most optimistic part of your chart. Things may not be as bad as you or others are making them out to be. Have a little faith, Virgo!

"
30 june 2019,virgo,"Chilling out and not doing much may sound real good today, but the planets suggest otherwise. Even if you’re just sitting back with a beer in you hand, you should at least be thinking about how you’ll be getting things done this week. Plan your work and work your plan.

"
1 july 2019,virgo,"Your subconscious mind could go into overdrive now that energetic Mars is in the most psychological part of your chart. This can go two ways: a bit tense, as old memories, dramas and fears rise to the surface. Or fabulous, as your intuition increases as does your motivation to be happier. Heal yourself.

"
2 july 2019,virgo,"A busy social season kicks off as Venus is getting ready to enter your house of networking. The only problem is that there may be so many people who want a piece of you that it will be hard to keep them happy! Don’t forget to leave some time for yourself too.

"
3 july 2019,virgo,"New people may come flooding into your life, courtesy of a solar eclipse in the networking part of your chart. Make new friends or join a club. Lend a hand to a volunteer effort. Join a mastermind group or find a mentor who can help you move your career along. Choose wisely, though, as Saturn–planet of long term consequences–is in a tough angle to the eclipse.

"
4 july 2019,virgo,"Saturn, planet of maturity and long term planning, is demanding that you associate only with people who respect   you. But today the ringed planet opposes the North Node, indicating that you may feel some kind of obligation to keep certain people in your life who aren’t the most supportive. Over the next few months you’ll have some decisions to make. Choose happiness.

"
5 july 2019,virgo,"A Moon-Jupiter-Neptune triangle recommends that you change the way you communicate with others, especially loved ones. There is a cathartic vibe going on here, so think of ways that you can get your point across without drama. Holding things in is not advised, and once the Moon moves into Virgo tomorrow, you can let it all out.

"
6 july 2019,virgo,"Yes! The Moon is in your sign, which means that it’s the perfect weekend to indulge in what matters to you. With so much energy in your friendship sector, you should be reaching out to the tribe and making plans. It’s time for an adventure or two, don’t you think?

"
7 july 2019,virgo,"Moody blues? Brainy Mercury begins to retrograde in the most hidden, psychological part of your chart. This could stir up all sorts of old memories and emotions, some of them on the stinky side. But this is necessary. The cosmos, in its wisdom, knows that we need to do a mental cleanse from time to time, and this is an excellent opportunity to heal. Complete this inner work by the 19th, at which time Mercury moves on.

"
8 july 2019,virgo,"Doing things a certain way because “that’s the way we’ve always done things” just isn’t going to work. You need a fresh approach, stat! Fortunately genius Uranus is active in one of the brainiest parts of your chart, helping you think outside of the box. The best part is that others will see the brilliance behind what you come up with.

"
9 july 2019,virgo,"It could become blindingly obvious that you don’t share the same opinions and values as others, and this could cause concern. Just chill out for now and don’t make any key decisions. Thursday and Friday are much better times for figuring it all out.

"
10 july 2019,virgo,"It’s a good day to patch things up with someone, thanks to a productive Sun-Neptune trine. The presence of the Sun indicates that you won’t have to grovel, and Neptune will help you be inspired. Keep opinions out of the picture, and avoid giving advice to someone else. Just make amends.

"
11 july 2019,virgo,"Are things going on behind the scenes? Your Spidey sense may tell you that something is up, but it is NOT wise to confront anyone or start texting away. First of all, you may be wrong. And even if you aren’t, you don’t want the other party to know you’re on to them.

"
12 july 2019,virgo,"There’s nothing wrong with you, Virgo. You are perfect just the way you are. That’s the message from the cosmos, and it’s high time you accepted it! Take good care of yourself this weekend, nurture your soul.

"
13 july 2019,virgo,"Things that you thought were going to be difficult to handle may actually go easier than you thought! Jupiter and Venus, the planets of ease and optimism, are well situated to help you right now. A nice sense of balance and contentment could grow, an added bonus.
 
 

"
14 july 2019,virgo,"Put on your battle helmet and flak jacket. The Sun opposes Pluto, a tough aspect as this will bring out power plays and ego trips. You’ll especially see this within a romantic relationship or among your friends. Either you’re going to be at the receiving end of it, or stuck in the middle somehow. An eclipse is coming on Tuesday, heightening the energy. Keep calm and carry on.

"
15 july 2019,virgo,"Both your head and your heart are hard at work today. Therefore you’ll be able to see both sides of a situation, especially one that involves people who mean a lot to you. If you’re looking for love someone new could be arriving soon, so don’t give up hope. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse is a romantic game changer.

"
16 july 2019,virgo,"The fifth house in astrology deals with love, children and creativity–and  all the ways of having fun! A sizzling lunar eclipse occurs here, which could bring something to a happy conclusion: conceiving a baby, meeting the love of your life, scoring a book deal or getting engaged, for starters. The key is to follow your own heart and keep others’ opinions (no matter how well meant) out of your decision making process.

"
17 july 2019,virgo,"Too many rules in a relationship can spoil spontaneity and a sense of freedom. This is true within a romance, family connections or business alliances. If anyone tries to hem you in today, chances are you’ll rebel. Is it time for a clean break, or do you just need to cool off for 24 hours?

"
18 july 2019,virgo,"Getting along with people becomes a heck of a lot easier, thanks to a Venus-Neptune trine. Friends and contacts could be unusually lucky for you too, as they can introduce you to a new lover or group of movers and shakers. It’s time for some fresh faces in your life!

"
19 july 2019,virgo,"The solar eclipse back on July 3rd focused on friends and any teams that you’re part of–volunteer organizations, clubs and the workplace. It opened up some new doors that will being many exciting new contacts into your life in the months ahead. Today Mercury starts retrograding through this sector, asking you to consider old friends and connections. Who has your back? Who doesn’t? If changes need to be made, don’t hesitate.

"
20 july 2019,virgo,"People may not be willing to play nice due to a Venus-Pluto opposition. This is more likely in your personal life than your professional one. There is a childish vibe going on here. It kind of reminds me of my sister, who in the midst of her 5th birthday party took all of her presents, went into her room, locked the door and left her friends to play party games by themselves. Yeah, it’s that kind of day.

"
21 july 2019,virgo,"It’s a great day for connecting with friends and loved ones thanks to a Mercury-Sun conjunction. Mercury is retrograde, so it’s possible that people from your past may reappear on the scene. Or issues that need to be resolved will crop up again. Fortunately the cosmic energy is logical and productive, so do your best to make things work.

"
22 july 2019,virgo,"Sshhh! The Sun enters Leo, the most reflective and sensitive part of your chart. It’s time to rest, recuperate and recharge your batteries. This is also the house of confidential matters, so you could be doing things behind the scenes to improve your situation. It’s especially important to work out housing, romantic and family matters before August 11th.

"
23 july 2019,virgo,"The Sun is now in the most confidential part of your chart and you have some big decisions to make. A Moon-Mars aspect helps you zoom in on the important matters and ignore the trivial ones. If you want to run something past a friend or mentor, tomorrow is an excellent time to do so.

"
24 july 2019,virgo,"There is only so much you can accomplish on your own, Virgo. The Sun and other orbs are in the most secluded part of your chart, so chances are you’re more interested in doing things by yourself. But a wonderful Mercury-Venus aspect today encourages you to bring in others to support you. Even if all you want is advice, get it–and then do your own thing.

"
25 july 2019,virgo,"Drama, begone! You’ll be highly motivated to keep the peace as healing, abundant Jupiter is active in your house of personal contentment. This doesn’t mean letting people walk all over you, or putting up with crummy situations. No, this is about developing wisdom. The kind that enables you to see the big picture: what’s truly important in life and what’s not.

"
26 july 2019,virgo,"Don’t let your emotions get the better of you, Virgo. A strong Mars-Saturn aspect helps you see things for the way they really are. Your intuition is on point too and will only continue to get stronger in the weeks ahead. That’s the benefit of psychic foresight: it helps you calm down and be self assured.

"
27 july 2019,virgo,"Feeling like a sexy, steamy agent provocateur?  You should be! Amorous Venus sashays into the most mysterious part of your chart, the place where fantasy reigns. Lusty Mars and the Sun are there too, making for a sultry month ahead. Get in touch with your erotic side!

"
28 july 2019,virgo,"Old emotional wounds get a nice dose of healing energy from Chiron and the Sun. The next few weeks are some of the best in years to do some inner work, the kind that can bring you peace. It’s worth the effort.

"
29 july 2019,virgo,"Opinionated bloviators may be circling like sharks, so unless you want to have an aggravating day, ignore them. Better yet, steer the Good Ship Virgo out of choppy waters and into calmer seas. Once Mercury goes direct on Wednesday you’ll be able to deal with people without pointing a harpoon at them.

"
30 july 2019,virgo,"You may be strongly tempted to push your own agenda today, but the cosmos warns against it. You need to be a bit more diplomatic in your approach. So go ahead, move forward with what you want to do. Just keep your ego out of it and remember that you need  cooperation from others.

"
31 july 2019,virgo,"Yesss!!! Your social life picks up steam now that Mercury is direct in your house of friends and networking. Misunderstandings will start to disappear, especially in team efforts. But even though you’ll be in the midst of more people, keep certain pieces of information to yourself. This is not the time to be an open book.

"
1 august 2019,virgo,"Stick with your own personal wisdom, Virgo. A cathartic new moon occurs in Leo, helping you release past dramas and feelings that may be holding you back. You know better than anyone what needs to go. Don’t listen to others, no matter how well-meaning they may be. Your sixth sense is solid gold right now.

"
2 august 2019,virgo,"Your sensitivity is heightened due to gentle Venus in the house of feelings and deep thoughts. But people in your world could be overly opinionated, which could set off feelings of discomfort and annoyance. This cosmic storm passes quickly as the Moon glides into Virgo tomorrow. So let it pass.

"
3 august 2019,virgo,"Just do “you” this weekend, Virgo! The Moon is in your sign and it’s time to get in touch with your authentic self. With so many planets in your house of closure and healing, you should be thinking about living differently. This doesn’t necessarily mean moving, changing jobs or revamping your look, although you could do that. This is more of an attitude adjustment, a positive change in your mental state!

"
4 august 2019,virgo,"Sometimes the less skin you show, the sexier you are. And the less you say creates more mystery. It’s time to be an agent provocateur  rather than a walking billboard, showing off your assets. Make them sweat and keep ’em guessing.

"
5 august 2019,virgo,"Show people that you know how to play by the rules, Virgo. Show them that you’re willing to listen to their point of view. You’re so used to doing everything on your own that sometimes you forget that you need the cooperation of others. Be a team player…for now, anyway!

"
6 august 2019,virgo,"Being outspoken may feel like it’s your right. After all, aren’t you allowed to have an opinion? But others may view you as being too pushy. Maybe they’re not used to how fervently you feel, and this is 100% their problem. However, if you have any doubts keep things a bit more subdued.

"
7 august 2019,virgo,"An amazing stroke of luck could come your way over the next few days. Or maybe it’s a piece of news. Either way, it’s something that should put your heart and mind at rest. Family and home related matters are especially well favored, and that includes creating a cozy nest with your lover.

"
8 august 2019,virgo,"Be more open about your feelings, but just with the people who count the most. A cathartic Venus-Jupiter aspect enables you to heal old wounds and feel better about the future. Today is also fabulous for romance. Single? Someone special may be admiring you from the sidelines. Coupled up Virgos should spend a sexy evening at home.

"
9 august 2019,virgo,"You’re in a wonky cosmic place these days. On the one hand, the Sun is in your house of seclusion, telling you to pull away from the crowd and pamper yourself. On the other hand, planets are active in your houses of love, family and friends! What’s a smart Virgo to do? Find a happy balance in which you have enough downtime for yourself and enough for socializing.

"
10 august 2019,virgo,"The blame game is a pointless activity, so don’t go there. And if other people are trying to make you feel guilty for something, let it go without making a big fuss. With the brilliant Sun in the most psychological part of your chart, you  will know what’s truly going on. No need to explain yourself to anyone.

"
11 august 2019,virgo,"Feeling more comfortable in your own skin is a lovely feeling that you can now enjoy! Jupiter just went direct in your domestic sector, which not only deals with home and family, but your inner sense of being “at home”. Logical Mercury zips into the house of the subconscious mind, helping you to get rid of fears and worries. And crazy Uranus retrogrades in the house of adventure, which will get rid of ups and downs that may have been driving you nuts.

"
12 august 2019,virgo,"With so much planetary activity lately in your house of seclusion, you may have forgotten how to have fun. Or maybe there hasn’t been quality time available for romance, hobbies and going out. That changes today thanks to a Mo0n-Saturn connection. Who cares if it’s a Monday? You desperately need to chill out.

"
13 august 2019,virgo,"Sticking to habits or routines could be difficult under today’s murky aspects. It could also be tough to figure out the best way to handle something. Don’t sweat it: this is temporary. Thursday’s full moon shines its powerful light on things, so wait until then if you can.

"
14 august 2019,virgo,"It’s time for some extreme self care, Virgo. With luxe Venus in your house of metamorphic changes, you should do what it takes to feel better about yourself and life in general. Maybe you need a visit to a spa, or a quick weekend out of town. Perhaps it’s some quiet time with a good book or a sexy lover! You know what’s best for you. Just do it.

"
15 august 2019,virgo,"Your birthday season is almost here, and it’s time to make more room in your life for people you love and enjoying life. Tonight’s full moon occurs in Aquarius, your sixth house of getting things done. It also governs vitality and health, so if yours needs an upgrade, start now. This year’s Virgo season is the most intense I’ve seen in a long time, and in a good way. You want to be rested and ready for it!

"
16 august 2019,virgo,"It’s always fun to daydream, but there has to be a limit to it. A Mercury-Uranus square brings a reality check. Pay attention today to facts and what’s going on in front of you. Red hot Mars will be entering Virgo in 48 hours, at which time you’ll be able to make things happen for real.

"
17 august 2019,virgo,"You don’t have to be friends with everyone, Virgo. At the office you don’t need to be the go-to person either. In love relationships, you don’t have to be the glue that is holding everything together. Quit putting this burden on yourself. Look out for #1 a bit more.

"
18 august 2019,virgo,"OK, birthday season is here! Not officially, of course–the Sun doesn’t show up in your sign til Friday. But red hot Mars enters Virgo today, a place it hasn’t been in two years. Mars will light a big fire under you to change your life path in every way possible. Pay close attention to your intuition as it is spot on right now.

"
19 august 2019,virgo,"There’s nothing wrong with pulling away from the crowd and the noise of life, Virgo. In fact, the planets recommend it! A healing lunar aspect is just the ticket for examining your thoughts and feelings. From your chart it appears that you need to adjust the way you handle things with loved ones especially. Reflect and revise.

"
20 august 2019,virgo,"News could come your way that might unsettle you somewhat. Is there any substance to it? Probably not. You’re in an emotional place due to the Moon squaring the Sun. With gentle Venus getting ready to enter your sign tomorrow, things will get better in the next 24 hours. Ignore idle gossip and speculation.

"
21 august 2019,virgo,"Are you ready for prime time? For your big debut? Gorgeous Venus enters Virgo today, making you the person to watch. But don’t be surprised if you’re feeling as though you’re not quite ready. Mercury is still in the most hidden part of your chart, telling you to take things slow.

"
22 august 2019,virgo,"People could be sending mixed signals, courtesy of murky Neptune acting up in your opposite sign. Your best bet is to use your intuition to figure out what’s going on, rather than confronting others with direct questions. This energy reoccurs around the 30th, but by that time the Sun will be in your sign—and you won’t give a hoot about what other people are thinking or saying!

"
23 august 2019,virgo,"Yeah, baby! The Sun is now in Virgo and you are finally the celestial favorite. This birthday season is fabulous for romance, thanks to Mars and Venus also being in your sign. Some ground breaking but fun surprises are ahead next week in all areas of your life, so pop open the champagne and toast your bad self.

"
24 august 2019,virgo,"If I could take your charisma and bottle it I’d be an overnight millionaire, Virgo! Today lusty Mars meets up with glamorous, amorous Venus in your sign. Your magnetism is at an all time high. Don’t worry, this energy won’t be fading anytime soon either. It keeps right on going all the way into mid-September, so go ahead…dazzle everyone.

"
25 august 2019,virgo,"Assertive Mars is in your sign and is hell bent on getting its way. Be careful, though, not to offend others while on your quest. Besides, are you really sure that you want everything just so? Some adventurous aspects starting tomorrow could open your eyes to fresh possibilities that you’ve never considered.

"
26 august 2019,virgo,"It’s time to overhaul your image, Virgo! Glamorous Venus high fives brilliant Uranus, which is in the “taking chances” sector. The next four days are awesome  for switching things up, from your clothes, hair and makeup to your attitude. People may be shocked but too bad! You’ll end up enjoying this process so much that you won’t care.

"
27 august 2019,virgo,"Loosen up, Virgo! Don’t expect everyone in your personal life to live by your “rules”. We’re all different people, with different opinions and backgrounds. If you are too judgmental you could lose valuable support.

"
28 august 2019,virgo,"With high octane Mars in your sign, your unstoppable. And today the red planet high-fives brilliant Uranus in your house of optimism and breaking past boundaries. Can it get any better than this? I don’t think so. Watch out, everyone: here comes Hurricane Virgo!

"
30 august 2019,virgo,"First the good news: the annual new moon in Virgo occurs today, the best time all year for kicking off initiatives that are important to you. By March 2020 you could see results. Now for the less exciting news: not everyone will support your plans. Expect the resistance to be more on the passive-aggressive kind rather than in-your-face. From your chart, though, it appears that you’re not going to care….or slow down!

"
31 august 2019,virgo,"“Patience is a virtue”, my grandmother always said to me, because heaven knows I was one impatient kid. And that’s the message the cosmos has for you today, Virgo: chill out already. It seems that you’re getting fed up with the inability of other people to make a decision or to be clear about something. Getting annoyed won’t help matters, but giving things time will.

"
1 september 2019,virgo,"You are a force to be reckoned with, something that people are going to figure out over the next two weeks. With spunky Uranus activating the most daring part of your chart, you’ll be ready to undertake new challenges without batting an eyelash. Travel and romance are especially well aspected right now. Surprise everyone with your own personal “shock and awe” campaign.

"
2 september 2019,virgo,"I have to hand it to you–you are turning into a phenom. With the Sun, Mars and Venus all ramping up your charm and motivation, the realization is hitting you that you’ve got this. Bravo! However, try telling this to people on the sidelines (aka trolls) who just want to tear you down. Avoid the losers and stick with the people on Team Virgo–even if you’re the only one on the team!

"
3 september 2019,virgo,"“Get outta my way!”  Geez, Virgo, you are beyond motivated these days. But you’re entitled to feel like this. Mercury, Mars and the Sun are all pushing you to look out for your own interests and plans. This isn’t selfish, it’s smart. This is truly the most intense Virgo season in years, and it’s time for you to switch things up in a major manner.

"
4 september 2019,virgo,"With so much planetary activity going on in your sign, you are primarily thinking about your own needs. Which is fine, by the way. But no man or woman is an island and you need to consider what others are thinking. The problem is that they may not know themselves why they want! So don’t even try to figure them out today. They’ll need to process their thoughts in their own sweet time.

"
5 september 2019,virgo,"The time has come to stop planning and to start doing. With so much positive planetary activity going on in the most creative part of your chart, your ability to produce something amazing is up there. Take this energy and run with it, as it will last all month long. (But that doesn’t give you license to procrastinate!)

"
6 september 2019,virgo,"Tiny houses, midcentury modern design, Japanese temples and gardens–what do all of these have in common? Simplicity. Curation. Deliberate choices to only have certain objects present. We can do this with other choices too: our careers, friends, “time off” activities and so on. Right now, Virgo, you’re facing a plethora of options. Start curating and simplify your life.

"
1 january 2019,libra,"New Year’s Day is typically a time when many people want to present a new self image to the world. Or at least they want to get that process in motion. Of all the signs of the zodiac, you have the greatest chance of making this happen! Optimistic Jupiter is in your house of self expression, enabling you to rebrand yourself. 2019 is the year to go loud and proud, not to hide in the shadows.

"
2 january 2019,libra,"If you have any serious decisions to make about a family or housing matter, now is the time to do so. This includes buying, renting, remodeling or redecorating. If you’re considering moving to a new location or cohabitating with a lover, this is the time to talk. Try to settle family squabbles or issues with an ex. Mature, logical Saturn has your back.

"
3 january 2019,libra,"Teamwork could be in short supply today. Colleagues, friends or family members could slack off big-time. Maybe they think it’s your job to do all the heavy lifting. It’s not, and they may need to be set straight.

"
4 january 2019,libra,"Domestic matters are picking up steam as a plethora pf planets activates this part of your chart. Moving to a new locale, redecorating, moving in with people, kicking others out, settling disputes with the family—all of this is in the cosmos’s crosshairs. Fortunately smooth talking Mercury glides into this part of your chart today.

"
5 january 2019,libra,"If anyone thinks that you’re the maid…..or the go-to person who needs to do things when others slack off….is dead wrong! But you’d better let them know that, otherwise you are stuck on that hamster wheel. Today magnetic Venus will enable you to (sweetly) let others know that playing Cinderella ain’t your thang.

"
6 january 2019,libra,"There is going to be a lot of action surrounding your home and family over the next few months. A solar eclipse occurs in your house of home and relatives, indicating that a fresh start is beginning. This could play out in so many ways: you could move to another state. Buy a house.

"
31 march 2019,libra,"There’s a saying: life begins at the end of your comfort zone. Keep that in mind over the next two months, because aggressive Mars is now in your house of taking chances.

"
7 april 2019,libra,"Chances are you’ve been pushing hard lately due to planetary activity in your house of productivity. Today is a smart time to get things in order at home, as disciplined Saturn is active in your domestic sector. But for heaven’s sakes don’t spend the whole day cleaning out the garage. Planets in your sports sector are also calling your name.

"
8 april 2019,libra,"Feeling resentful lately? Maybe it’s because you have so many planets in your house of efficiency, and you may feel as though you’re the only one doing anything. If that’s the case you may need to set some boundaries. Will other people listen? Probably not. Stop doing as much and let them start picking up the slack.

"
9 april 2019,libra,"Someone close may be going through a hard time, and you may need to help them out. This is more on an emotional level than a financial one. You are in a very practical place thanks to logical Mercury by your side. Will they listen? perhaps. At least you tried to assist them.

"
10 april 2019,libra,"How do you present yourself to the world? That’s the question posed by abundant Jupiter as it begins to retrograde in the heavens. How you speak, think and write are all part of this “renewal project”. Things could slow down, like writing your thesis, negotiating contracts or social media campaigns. But practice makes perfect, so keep hammering away.

"
11 april 2019,libra,"You could be incredibly inspired to live a healthier, fitter, more vibrant life. Planets are active in your house of wellness.

"
15 april 2019,libra,"Become as focused as a laser beam, Libra. Other people may try to pull you off track with their petty nonsense and dramas. But you have things to do, and if you get sucked in, you’ll never finish. Besides, negativity spreads like a cancer. Keep it away from you.

"
16 april 2019,libra,"Dealing with aches and pains that don’t seem to go away? Or perhaps you know that it’s time to get on a diet and exercise plan. Old habits die hard, and this could be why your body is in the shape that it’s in. A Moon-Neptune opposition could make you painfully aware of this. Here’s some good news though: Friday’s full moon is in your sign, boosting your determination to change.

"
17 april 2019,libra,"The full moon is arriving in your sign on Friday, and you have a lot of big decisions to make.

"
25 april 2019,libra,"Lay down the law with people who’ve been butting in to your affairs, or criticizing you. You don’t need their input. Unfortunately, they haven’t figured that out yet. Do this now or you’ll lose your cool this coming weekend.

"
26 april 2019,libra,"Dot your i’s and cross your t’s: the nitpickers are out there today, and your boss could be one of them. So could a major client or some other authority figure. This is not a good day to call out sick, show up late or do sloppy work. Keep it professional.

"
27 april 2019,libra,"Facts and details may be hard to come by, and people could be talking in circles. This won’t sit well with you, because with Mars in the most visionary part of your chart, you can see the big picture. It’s going to take other people awhile to come around, so you’ll need to be patient.

"
28 april 2019,libra,"Matters at home definitely need tending. This includes your relationships with family members, even if they live elsewhere. But this doesn’t mean that you must play the role of peace maker. Nor do you have to clean up someone else’s mess.

"
2 may 2019,libra,"People could be sticklers, demanding that things be done a certain way. Their  way of doing things may be completely irrational, but they won’t want to hear that. Trying to talk sense to them won’t work, not today. Tomorrow is a much different story.

"
3 may 2019,libra,"You could find yourself in the right place, at the right time and with just the right words! A terrific Mercury-Jupiter aspect helps you shine.

4 may 2019,libra,"A new Moon occurs in one of the most interesting parts of your chart, the eighth house of sex and net worth. It opens up a brand new chapter during which your love life can become more intimate, with a deeper emotional connection to boot. Building a stronger financial foundation is also possible. However, don’t count your chickens before they hatch. Give things time to gel.

"
5 may 2019,libra,"Being optimistic is generally considered to be a positive trait. However, a Jupiter-Mars opposition warns against being overly confident about where things are going.

24 may 2019,libra,"Yikes. This could be one emotional day, courtesy of a Moon-Venus square. You’re going to have to make a concerted effort to not respond to every provocation. The moon is in the most dramatic part of your chart, so you run the risk of flying off the handle. Take a deep breath and count to ten.

"
25 may 2019,libra,"Your personal magnetism is high, so work it! Seriously, this is a good time to charm others, ask for what you want or make a splash in the business world. You’re starting to realize that you can achieve so much more than you previously thought, and this is a good thing.

"
26 may 2019,libra,"The Sun is in the most adventurous part of your chart, which is a good thing… it’s trying to push you forward. But sometimes you need the cooperation and the blessing of other people in order to get from point a to point B. A positive solar aspect today helps you win them over.

"
27 may 2019,libra,"If your current job or occupation is not fulfilling, then it’s time for a change. In astrology, the North Node of the Moon points out what you should be doing in this lifetime. It is activated today by inspirational Neptune. This is one of the best times in 2019 to change your career path.

"
28 may 2019,libra,"Optimism will take you only so far, Libra. At some point you have to get down to the nitty-gritty details and facts. Right now would be a good time, according to your chart! As the week progresses, other people may try to pull you into their hare brained schemes. Avoid them and stick to what you have in front of you.

"
29 may 2019,libra,"Here’s the good news: you are in an amazingly visionary state right now. Now for the “meh” news: you’re overlooking key details or processes. Or maybe the people around you are slacking, confused or unwilling to do something constructive. Wait until tomorrow, a much better day to gain clarity and to inspire the troops.

"
30 may 2019,libra,"Yikes. A Mercury-Jupiter smackdown could bring out the braggarts, bloviators and egomaniacs. It could also make relatively sane people make statements that they can’t follow through on. They’re not trying to be deceptive; they’re confused and maybe way too optimistic. Ley your own wisdom guide you today, not someone else’s.

"
31 may 2019,libra,"Confidence is sexy. And a healthy, glowing body is too. It doesn’t matter what the scale says; as long as you feel vibrant and you’re putting good things into your body you’ll have personal magnetism oozing out of every pore. A terrific Neptune-Venus trine helps you to create solid health habits and stick with them.

"
1 june 2019,libra,"“If you want someone’s attention, whisper.” That was an advertising slogan for a perfume back in the 80s called “Nuance”. I think you get the idea: you’ll make more progress by being gentle and laid back rather than bashing someone over the head with your message. And a luscious Venus-Jupiter says the same.

"
2 june 2019,libra,"Spirituality may be calling your name, Libra. A positive Venus aspect recommends delving into “alternative” methods when it comes to finding inner peace. You are more determined than ever to feel calm and in control of your life. Consider meditation, psychic development, shamanism or Eastern philosophies as a way to feel stronger and content.

"
3 june 2019,libra,"Famed architect Mies van der Rohe said, “God dwells in the details.” He was referring to paying attention to every little detail when designing a magnificent building. But this is good advice for your life right now, Libra. The new moon occurs in the most optimistic, free styling sector of your chart. You will be tempted to take on challenges that you would never considered before. However, you need a good blueprint, just as an architect does.

"
4 june 2019,libra,"You are firing on all cylinders, Libra! Yesterdays new moon was in your house of adventure and breaking away from the past. And today logical Mercury enters your house of goals and achievement. You are now in an awesome position for making things happen. By the end of 2019, your life could look radically different than the way it does now.

"
6 june 2019,libra,"Your emotions will start to even out thanks to calm Venus in action in your house of psychological depth. From your chart it appears that you need to take more ownership over what’s going on in your life. Otherwise you’re going to be tossed around by every wonky thing that happens in your environment.

"
7 june 2019,libra,"A career or investment option could come your way, and it might be a winner. Success won’t happen overnight but if you’re willing to put in the time it could pay off nicely. Profits planet Venus enters your house of entrepreneurship tomorrow, so you should consider your own startup.

"
11 june 2019,libra,"You’re right on track with your ideas. The problem is that people around you are not! They may try to sway you over to their way of thinking, but this is a mistake. They haven’t thought things through. Stick to your guns, especially through the full moon on the 21st. 

"
12 june 2019,libra,"You may think that your life is following a particular path, but there are some interesting (and good) surprises ahead! Sometimes all it takes is removing the blinders from our eyes. Between now and July 1st you could witness some revolutionary changes.

"
13 june 2019,libra,"Our family history drills so much into our brains that we often don’t realize how pre-programmed we have become. A wonderful Sun-Pluto aspect is just the ticket for identifying and releasing some old childhood baggage. Once it’s gone, don’t look back.

"
14 june 2019,libra,"It’s always a good thing when you can play by the rules….but break them just a bit at the same time! And that’s exactly what you’ll be able to do today. Don’t be afraid to show others that you have talent and desires and dreams. Your optimistic attitude will be infectious. People need some inspiration.

"
15 june 2019,libra,"Are you in the right line of work? That’s the question asked by the cosmos today and over the next few weeks. Maybe you love your field but not the company you work for. Or perhaps you want to start your own business. Consider your options, because the solar eclipse arriving on July 3rd is the best time all year to make changes.

"
16 june 2019,libra,"Stick to what is most important to you this week, and don’t get thrown off track. A solid Mercury-Neptune aspect will enable you to do just that today, but it could be harder on Wednesday. Be as focused as a laser beam.

"
17 june 2019,libra,"Express yourself! The full moon occurs in your house of thinking, writing and speaking. A project that you’ve been working on could come to a successful close. This sector also deals with partying (yay!) and short distance travel, so make some fun plans. Singles, you could meet a new flame close to home.

"
18 june 2019,libra,"You’ve been working hard and people are impressed. Offers could come your way, but are they what you really want? Don’t rush to make a decision. The Cancer time period is your best time all year to score big and it begins on Friday.

"
19 june 2019,libra,"Someone could hand you grief about how you’re spending your time and energy. They may also be peeved about your life choices. Who cares? You’re entitled to do things your way. If they have any doubt about that, then wait until they see what happens after the Sun enters your house of ambition on Friday.

"
20 june 2019,libra,"With unpredictable Uranus in an emotional part of your chart, the smallest thing could set you off today. Keep jealousy and anger and resentment at bay, if you can. The mighty Sun rolls into the most authoritative part of your chart tomorrow. Once that happens you’ll be feeling more confident.

"
21 june 2019,libra,"First the good news: the mighty Sun enters your house of ambition and success! This always happens this time of year, but 2019 brings some interesting twists. There will be a solar eclipse in this sector on July 3rd, which could bring about some exciting new changes that you may not even be aware of right now. But  Neptune starts to retrograde in your house of habits and efficiency. Do you have your act together? Are you truly organized enough to take advantage of new opportunities?

"
22 june 2019,libra,"Time to go on a diet and exercise program? With the Moon in the fitness sector this is a smart thing to consider. Even if your body is perfectly toned, you may still need to get more sleep and eat nutritious goods. Now that the Sun is in the most ambitious part of your chart, you need all the energy you can muster.

"
24 june 2019,libra,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Libra, and there are only so many things you can accomplish. Be wary of taking on too much. You may think you’re an unstoppable force but eventually you’ll burn out.

"
25 june 2019,libra,"Your relationships with other people are a big focus this week. Chiron, the wounded healer, is active. If you’re simmering with resentment, or there is some kind of unfinished business, you need to get it out in the open. Once Mercury enters your house of friendly cooperation tomorrow, the path will become much easier.

"
26 june 2019,libra,"Group activities, parties, hanging out with friends: all of these develop momentum now that Mercury is in your house of networking. Anything with a due date (such as planning a family reunion or finishing a big work project) should be completed before July 7th, at which point Mercury goes retrograde.

"
28 june 2019,libra,"From your chart it appears that you need to vent. Emotional pressure is building up and you need to release it. A cathartic Moon-Saturn aspect allows you to do this maturely, with positive long term benefits.

"
29 june 2019,libra,"Can we all agree to disagree? People may be more willing than usual to see the viewpoint of others. It’s not the end of the world if everyone isn’t on the same page. What matters is that you respect each other’s viewpoints.

"
30 june 2019,libra,"Talk is cheap, so pay attention if someone is trying to get you to do things their way. Either they’re working with an agenda, or they are completely clueless about what they’re saying. Let your own wisdom guide you.

"
1 july 2019,libra,"You’re known by the company you keep, Libra. Mars enters your house of friends and networking for the first time since 2017, casting its light on your connections. Mercury is here too and is scheduled to go retrograde on the 7th. New friends and colleagues will enter your life, people from the past will return, and you’ll be able to tighten your circle.

"
2 july 2019,libra,"A solar eclipse arrives tomorrow in the most ambitious part of your chart. The question is: what (or whom!) should you pursue? Some dreams may not be worth the price you’ll have to pay to achieve them. Consider this carefully.

"
3 july 2019,libra,"A powerful solar eclipse takes place in your house of ambition and success, lighting a fire under you to go after the items on your bucket list. Between now and the end of the year you’ll be able to move mountains. However, you must maintain some kind of balance between your personal life and your drive to accomplish. Otherwise you’ll lose loved ones and burn out….not a happy prospect!

"
4 july 2019,libra,"You don’t need anyone’s approval to do things your way, Libra. Remember that, as a Saturn-North Node opposition could bring out people who want to lay a guilt trip on you. Yesterday’s solar eclipse shone its magnificent light on your big plans. You won’t go anywhere if you’re being held hostage by others’ agendas.

"
5 july 2019,libra,"It’s a great day for rallying the troops to get things done. Maybe the “troops” are your kids, who need to clean up their bedrooms. Or they’re co-workers who need to get on board with a particular project. Or it’s friends and family members who are planning a wedding or reunion. You can inspire them, so lead the charge.

"
6 july 2019,libra,"The weekend has a secluded vibe as the Moon enters Virgo. Chances are you’ll want to pull away from the madding crowd and take good care of yourself. This could mean staying at home and binge watching Netflix, or just taking a nap. Maybe you should book a massage at a day spa. Do whatever it takes to recharge your batteries.

"
7 july 2019,libra,"Who can you count on the most in this crazy world? That’s the question asked by Mercury as it begins to retrograde in your house of friends and networking. If anyone is bringing too much drama into your life, or they’re too self centered, it’s time for a change. Between now and the 19th you’ll be able to suss what’s going on.

"
8 july 2019,libra,"Money could come your way in a most unexpected manner, so keep an eye out for opportunities! This isn’t so much about winning the lottery as it is about coming up with an idea for making passive income. You’re also in a good spot for landing a better job and earning more, so either way you come out ahead.

"
9 july 2019,libra,"A battle may be raging between your personal life and your professional one. Maybe the boss is asking too much of you. Or perhaps you’ve been pushing yourself too hard. This theme is going to come up several more times between now and the 17th, so give it thought. A lunar eclipse on the 16th will be decision time.

"
10 july 2019,libra,"Everyone loves a winner and that’s how you’re going to look—like someone who’s got what it takes! Challenges won’t be a problem for you and people will take note of your can-do attitude. A tip from the cosmos: going it alone right now is better than teaming up.

"
11 july 2019,libra,"Mars and Uranus, the two most stubborn planets in the solar system, are at odds. People could be touchy, or worse–argumentative, jealous or unpredictable. This could throw off either your efforts or those of a group. Tomorrow is a better day to get everyone back on track.

"
12 july 2019,libra,"Whether you know it or not, a lot of people are looking up to you as a role model. This means that you can influence their lives for the better, something that they will treasure. Be open to mentoring someone who needs guidance.

"
13 july 2019,libra,"You’ve got the gift of gab, so work it, honey! A lucky Jupiter-Moon aspect helps to put just the right words in your mouth. The same goes for the written word.  Whether you’re talking to a loved one or promoting the living daylights out of yourself, progress can be made.

"
14 july 2019,libra,"You’ve got places to go and people to meet. You have a life that needs to be led to the fullest. So why are people trying to get in your way? Uh, blame it on pigheaded Pluto, which is opposing the Sun. Don’t be surprised if others use passive-aggressive tactics to get their way. A lunar eclipse is coming on Tuesday, at which time you may just say “enough is enough.”

"
15 july 2019,libra,"Some serious decisions need to be made regarding a residential, family or romantic issue. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse is bringing things to a head, and you’ll feel it today. Tough guys Pluto and Saturn are in no mood for nonsense. Thing long term and protect your own interests. This isn’t selfish; it’s smart.

"
16 july 2019,libra,"Maintaining a balance between your personal and professional lives is a big story in July, thanks to two eclipses in these parts of your chart. One eclipse occurred on the 3rd and another takes place today. Seems like you’ve got some big decisions to make, and this could include having a baby, moving in with a lover or moving to a new place. With mature, long term Saturn nearby, you need to think things through carefully.

"
17 july 2019,libra,"Old memories from your childhood could come racing back as you attempt to do something. Let’s face it, we all have some negative programming from back in the day. The question is: are you going to let it cripple you? Figure out why this blockage is happening, then do what’s necessary to remove it.

"
18 july 2019,libra,"Charm will get you much further than the use of force, Libra! So take a break from ultimatums and scorched earth tactics. As a matter of fact, do the opposite—be soft spoken, maybe even a little mysterious. This will work in love as well as business, so sweeten your words and get to work!

"
19 july 2019,libra,"Career matters and other big goals go under review as Mercury retrogrades back into this part of your chart. This is not the disaster you might expect; it could be enormously helpful. Things that lost momentum (or died) could actually get resuscitated and start to move forward. Between now and the 31st is a smart time to rethink the path ahead for the remainder of 2019.

"
20 july 2019,libra,"The Sun is spending two last days in your house of ambition and success, telling you to focus on what’s most important to you. A Pluto-Venus opposition, though, could bring out resistance from other people, who want you to do things their way. It may be time to set some boundaries and let them know that (a) you have your own life and (b) you intend to run it your way.

"
21 july 2019,libra,"This is the Sun’s last day in your house of career and other important life goals, so hustle while you can! That said, Wednesday is productive as there are still celestial orbs in this sector, helping you out. Today the Sun lines up perfectly with brainy Mercury, making now a good time to negotiate, make presentations or come to a decision about your next step.

"
22 july 2019,libra,"Work that contact list, Libra. And call all your friends to schedule some epic parties and adventures. The Sun is now in Leo, your eleventh house of hanging out with BFFs, team members, mentors and clubs. The people you know could be unusually lucky for you over the next month. Work in a tech-heavy career? Then you’ll benefit as the eleventh house governs the digital world.

"
23 july 2019,libra,"There’s a nice air of cooperation going on thanks to a Moon-Mars trine. If you’ve been thinking about joining a team, making new friends or finding The One, this is an auspicious time to do so. Over the next four weeks you should make every effort to meet new people and reconnect with folks from your past.

"
24 july 2019,libra,"Finding work that you truly enjoy is in the stars, Libra. A wonderful Venus-Mercury meet up is just the ticket for focusing on doing something that makes you heart sing. The good news is that Mercury is logical and strategic, whereas Venus governs profits….and makes things easier than expected!

"
25 july 2019,libra,"From your chart one thing is really obvious: you need to be involved in lots of social activities! Lucky Jupiter could bring in new faces, people who could become BFFs, lovers, colleagues or team members. Long term Saturn is well aspected too, indicating that some of these folks could be around for the long haul. It’s also an excellent time to reconnect with people you already know. Right now the more, the merrier.

"
26 july 2019,libra,"Are you on the same page as the people in your world? Today is a good time to find out if you share the same dreams and values. Friends, family, lovers, colleagues…everyone counts. If you discover that there is a difference of opinion, no need to freak out. Cosmic aspects over the next week will help you work through this.

"
27 july 2019,libra,"Well, aren’t you the belle of the ball! Gorgeous Venus just entered your house of socializing, joining the Sun and Mars. Over the next few weeks you will meet new people and reconnect with old friends and business contacts. Speaking of business, this sector happens to govern technology too. If you’re in a tech-heavy field–a blog, online store, social media marketing or website development–hustle while you can.

"
28 july 2019,libra,"If you feel the need to upgrade some of the people you hang out with, date or work with, don’t feel guilty. From your chart it appears that you should be spending more time with people who share your values and interests. This isn’t ruthless; it’s part of growing as an individual and recognizing your needs.

"
29 july 2019,libra,"A colleague, friend or loved one could act out in a surprising way. Maybe they don’t want to play by the rules. Or maybe they just feel like slacking off. Perhaps they woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Let this pass, because in 24 hours things should be back on track.

"
30 july 2019,libra,"Getting lost in trivial details is possible as Neptune swirls its mist. This is especially true at the office or when dealing with friends. You may need to steer people back to a more logical, big picture kind of a place. Otherwise you’ll get sucked in to paralysis by analysis.

"
31 july 2019,libra,"Big plans start to develop momentum now that Mercury is direct in your ambition sector! Other people are going to play a big role in helping you achieve your dreams, so don’t try to fly solo over the next four weeks. Find a mentor. Ask a friend to set you up with someone. Join a master mind group, a club or a charity. The more people you connect with, the better.

"
1 august 2019,libra,"The Leo new moon will bring plenty of people into your life over the next few months, from old friends to new ones. It’s a good time to join a club or take part in a volunteer organization. Steer clear, however, of jealous types and those who think that drama is a good thing. It’s not. This includes a lover, by the way, so if your amour has been too volatile take a timeout!

"
2 august 2019,libra,"Feeling annoyed? Unappreciated? Got one nerve left and everyone’s working it? Yeah, it’s that kind of a day. Gentle Venus is squared by impetuous Uranus, which means that people could be irrational and rude. But this shouldn’t ruin the flow of your precious chi. The Moon is about to enter the most chilled out, metaphysical part of your chart. So get in a lotus pose and start chanting “oohhmmmm.” Namaste.

"
3 august 2019,libra,"The planets are pushing you to socialize, so go ahead and party your little heart out. But don’t be surprised if you feel like calling it a day (or night) a little early so that you can spend some time alone. The Moon is in the most secluded part of your chart, urging you to pamper yourself.

"
4 august 2019,libra,"Friends and family members may offer suggestions to you, and if you’re smart you’ll listen. Their advice may actually be good this time (LOL)! But this doesn’t mean that you have to do what they say; just pay attention. By the way, they’ll still be at it as the week progresses, so be prepared to slow down and take it all in.

"
5 august 2019,libra,"Inspiration could hit you to take much better care of your health, and this is a smart move. There will be a new moon on the 30th in a house that deals with surgery, physical therapy and other major medical issues. This isn’t to say that you’re going to need these modalities. But prevention is the best cure, so the more proactive you are now the less you’ll have to deal with later.

"
6 august 2019,libra,"With erratic Uranus acting up in one of the most emotional parts of your chart, you could fly off the handle easily. And even if you are the picture of serenity someone else could be bouncing off the walls—your  walls. Take a deep breath, count to ten and say “Namaste”. This cosmic sh**storm is over tomorrow.

"
7 august 2019,libra,"Get out of the house. I mean it. You need to be networking and partying your little tuckus off right now, Libra. An amazing Sun-Jupiter aspect indicates that people could be enormously helpful and lucky for you right now. They could introduce you to a new lover or tip you off about a job opening. Invitations could come in to join a club or elite group. But none of this will happen if you’re sitting on the sofa watching TV. Out the door, now!

"
8 august 2019,libra,"Today is perfect for being carefree and having a good time. Does that mean calling in sick to work? Yeah, maybe! At least leave some time for socializing, as a juicy Venus-Jupiter trine brings luck to gatherings. You never know who you might meet. This aspect is amazing for romance: finding new love for singles, or reaching an agreement about shared dreams with a lover.

"
9 august 2019,libra,"If you want to move forward in life with some degree of peace and sanity, it’s critical to work things out with the people in your life. You don’t have to cave in to their demands and do things their way. But some kind of consensus needs to be reached, at home, with a lover and at the office. Some important aspects coming on Sunday will help smooth things over.

"
10 august 2019,libra,"Try to be open minded about people whose opinions are different than your own. Make an attempt, too, to be patient if they seem to be confused or unable to get their point across. Face it, we all have moments like this. Once Jupiter goes direct tomorrow the lines of communication will become clearer.

"
11 august 2019,libra,"Your emotions calm down, it’s easier to communicate, and you’ll be spending more time with friends and people who count. What’s not to like about this forecast? Yup, mighty Jupiter goes direct in your house of self expression, just as chatty Mercury zips into your house of friends and socializing. And Uranus, which has stirring up turbulence in your psyche, goes retrograde—a blessing as you’ll start to chill out!

"
12 august 2019,libra,"Family members need to know where you’re coming from, Libra. This may include some boundaries, the kind that you’ll set. Mature Saturn demands that everyone acts like a grownup, which means releasing old roles and dramas from way  back when.

"
13 august 2019,libra,"Steer clear of known divas and trolls, and stick with the people you can count on to be calm….and fun! There is a lot of planetary activity encouraging you to “upgrade” your life by associating with people who lift you up. With so much planetary activity these days in your house of networking, you may want to be friends with everybody. Sorry, that doesn’t work. Be nice to everyone, but curate who is allowed into your circle.

"
14 august 2019,libra,"A yummy Venus-Sun conjunction could bring new love into your life, someone who is your friend as well as your sexy romantic partner. And if you’re already attached, this energy is super for getting on the same page about shared dreams. Considering that tomorrow’s full moon falls in the house of amour, you need to know what direction things are going in.

"
15 august 2019,libra,"Sweet! The Aquarius full moon shines its light on your love life. Something wonderful could come to fruition, and that includes those of you who are single. Just keep your friends out of your business, as a tense Mercury-Uranus aspect indicates that they might interfere, or be jealous. Their time will come. Now is your moment.

"
16 august 2019,libra,"Raging against the machine–or the system, the team, your loved ones–is not a good plan. Maybe you’re being taken for granted. Perhaps others aren’t playing fair. But losing your cool and pitching a fit will get you nowhere. Chill out, because solutions will arise by next Wednesday.

"
17 august 2019,libra,"You can’t be working all of the time, Libra! A Saturn-North Node opposition warns against spending too much time at the office and/or taking the stress home with you. Fortunately planets will be moving into the most healing, psychological part of your chart next week. You need to unwind. Start today.

"
18 august 2019,libra,"A magnificent period lies ahead for you, Libra, one in which you’ll go through an amazing transformation. Mars is now in your twelfth house of closure and reflection. In the next few weeks other planets will follow, all of them pushing you to take a long look at what’s working in your life and what’s not. This may not always be easy but it is necessary. By the time your birthday season arrives, you may not even recognize yourself!

"
19 august 2019,libra,"The next four days are well aspected for obtaining advice from the people in your world, Libra. Don’t be too proud or shy to ask for it. It would also be beneficial for you to join some kind of a team or group, whether in your personal life or professional one. You’ll gain insight from them and have fun at the same time.

"
20 august 2019,libra,"People in your world may be out of sorts due to a Sun-Moon square. Diplomacy and gentle words may not work, so don’t waste your time! This aspect will be history by tomorrow and the energy is so much more upbeat. So pull away if you can and wait for them to become more agreeable.

"
21 august 2019,libra,"You may be surrounded by people—family, friends, colleagues–who all want to spend some quality time with you! Parties and get togethers may be calling your name. But don’t feel badly about being selective and spending some time alone. Gentle Venus has just entered the quietest, most healing part of your chart. You need to recharge your batteries.

"
22 august 2019,libra,"You want to be a giver and help someone out, but are they capable of handling their own problems? Probably. Don’t fall prey to poor-little-me routines. Sometimes the best way to assist someone is to give them a little guidance, step away and let them figure out what they need to do.

"
23 august 2019,libra,"Hush, child. It’s time to slow down, relax and take good care of yourself, especially your mind. The Sun is now in Virgo, your twelfth house of seclusion and emotional healing. The next three weeks will be powerfully transformative, with every day giving you the opportunity to walk away from the past and its worries.

"
24 august 2019,libra,"Fantasies take flight as Venus and Mars connect in the most secluded, mysterious part of your chart. This could be the sexual and romantic kind of adventure, for sure. But you could also be daydreaming about other grand experiences you’d like to have. Pay close attention to your intuition as it could send you valuable wisdom.

"
25 august 2019,libra,"A passionate side of you emerges, Libra–a side that has been hidden for far too long. This could manifest itself in a romantic relationship. Or your passion could be directed toward a charitable project, or your career. The most important thing is that you share this energy with people who feel the same way you do.

"
26 august 2019,libra,"The sudden realization may hit you that you’re prettier/handsomer, sexier and more passionate than you knew. A wonderful Uranus aspect helps you get in touch with a side of yourself that (a) you’ve never seen before or (b) has been buried for so long you forgot it was there. Better yet is that Uranus is going to be active all week, so get ready to be enlightened.

"
27 august 2019,libra,"Tired of feeling that you need to do things expected of you—from family or society? A Moon-Pluto opposition could get your back up pretty easily. Over the next few days you should do a lot of thinking about this. Some wonderfully healing and metamorphic aspects are at play for the rest of the week.

"
28 august 2019,libra,"An amazing catharsis can happen today, so get ready for a “eureka!” moment. The energy is healing on both a physical and psychological level.

Maybe it’s a friend or family member who is willing to help you with seed money. Your mortgage application may go through without a hitch. But your intuition is very strong, so don’t overlook the chance of having an absolutely genius idea for an investment or business of your own.

"
30 august 2019,libra,"May the healing begin! A new moon in the most cathartic part of your chart could bring a 180 degree change in your mental, emotional and physical health—if you allow it. The problem is that Neptune opposes the Moon, unwilling to get started on the necessary changes that need to be made. But if you want greater vitality and serenity enough, you’ll do what it takes.

"
31 august 2019,libra,"You may be trying to help someone see the light of day, but chances are they’re still in the dark. Hey, you’ve done your best. From now on the best way to be of assistance is to let them figure things out for themselves.

"
4 september 2019,libra,"There are some happy aspects coming your way in the near future, the kind that will make you feel that all is right with the world.

"
6 september 2019,libra,"What other people say is not as important as what your own inner wisdom is telling you. There may be well-meaning people in your midst who are anxious to give you advice, but the cosmos recommends ignoring it. Right now you’re in a wonderful place where your emotions and thoughts are balancing out, kind of like nature settling down after a storm. Let this happen at its own pace and without interference.

"
6 january 2019,scorpio,"This is no time to hide in the shadows, Scorpio! A sizzling solar eclipse occurs in your house of self-promotion. This is the also the house of expressing yourself, being verbally, in writing or through artwork.

"
7 january 2019,scorpio,"Show me the money! Golden girl Venus glides into your house of income and savings, blessing you with its presence.

Social media, blogging, networking events, lecturing and schmoozing are all good options.

"
8 january 2019,scorpio,"You may need to be the voice of reason in a particular situation today. Don’t get caught up in “group think”; the group may have their collective heads up their asses. But don’t expect them to see the light, even if you shine it in their faces. Some people need to learn the hard way.

"
9 january 2019,scorpio,"Don’t be surprised if you get hit with the sudden urge to purge. Jammed up closets, junk drawers, cluttered email accounts, a messy desk….all of these can go bye-bye. Spontaneous Uranus is acting up in your house of efficiency.

"
19 january 2019,scorpio,"
With so much planetary activity in the mental parts of your chart you should be dreaming up all sorts of juicy ideas.

"
20 january 2019,scorpio,"
The Sun moves into Aquarius, your house of domestic matters and contentment. But finding peace could be difficult with a Venus-Neptune square. Loved ones may be hard to figure out, not speaking plainly or acting normally! That’s okay. By tomorrow you’ll be in the driver seat.

21 january 2019,scorpio,"

Time is money, as the saying goes, and this really applies to Scorpios right now. Make sure that you’re only involved with people, projects and habits that will pay off. Don’t be afraid to cut out the fluff. Be ruthless about how you spend your time.

"
26 january 2019,scorpio,"
One part of your brain is saying to push, and push hard. The other side is asking you what the rush is all about. It’s one thing to be motivated and another to be sloppy. Make sure that you’re giving certain people and situations the time they need.

"
27 january 2019,scorpio,"
News flash: you can’t have things your way all the time! Sorry, Scorpio, but you could be a bit pissy today due to the Moon in your sign. Make nice with other people before they start plotting against you.

"
28 january 2019,scorpio,"

"
12 march 2019,scorpio,"
With the Sun in your house of luxury goods and having fun, no doubt you feel like spending. But a tense Jupiter-Sun aspect warns against this. It’s time to become practical and conservative about money. This will become even clearer when the Sun enters Aries next Wednesday.

"
18 march 2019,scorpio,"
Maybe you’re interested in being number one, making it to the top of the heap. But the planets suggest that you’ll get much further if you view others as partners than as rivals. Don’t worry, you’ll still make it to the top!

10 may 2019,scorpio,"Get ready for snits and tantrums as people around you won’t be willing to pull their weight. They’ll have plenty of excuses and may try to pull rank on top of it. The smartest thing you can do is to ignore them and just do your own thing.

"
11 may 2019,scorpio,"Say what you mean and mean what you say! With stern Saturn in your house of self expression, you can get your point across with ease and eloquence. Better yet is that with a Sun-Saturn trine people may actually be listening, and agree. More power to ya, babe.

"
12 may 2019,scorpio,"It’s always a wonderful day when the cosmos suggests retail therapy and that’s what’s happening today! Glamour girl Venus is in a spending mood and the Moon says “go for it”, so have fun. Just don’t go overboard, because aggressive Mars is in your house of credit card debt.

"
13 may 2019,scorpio,"Super day to negotiate deals or to get your point across to loved ones. It’s also a smart time to get to the bottom of something that has been perplexing or troubling you. Don’t be surprised either if people want to team up with you, either romantically or in business; you exude talent and desirability!

"
14 may 2019,scorpio,"Lines of communication open up wide with a Mars-Venus connection. It’s a good time to get things out in the open. Your emotions could have been allover the place lately; when Mars changes signs tomorrow things will start to calm down.

"
15 may 2019,scorpio,"Romance gets a sweet boost from Venus entering your commitment sector. If you’re single and looking, keep an open mind: lusty Mars enters the multiculti ninth house, indicating that someone from a completely different background could be coming your way.

"
16 may 2019,scorpio,"Logic prevails, and anyone who tries to bamboozle you won’t get too far. You’re in charge when it comes to speaking your opinion, negotiating deals or having a heartfelt talk with a loved one. They need to listen as your words carry wisdom.

"
17 may 2019,scorpio,"You’re in no mood these days for shaky situations. With Jupiter retrograding through your house of stability, you’re becoming a lot more aware of people and situations that are creating havoc in your life. This is going to require a fresh approach on your part. What needs to change?

"
18 may 2019,scorpio,"Yes! Tonight’s full moon is in Scorpio, bringing things to a successful close. Initiatives that you may have started around the time of your birthday could see momentum. If you’ve been slacking since then, this is a good time to get off your duff. Oh, and surprise-a-minute Uranus is stirring up good trouble in your house of love!

"
19 may 2019,scorpio,"Your opinions matter, but other people may not be willing to listen. So you have one of two choices: either to get annoyed that they’re not listening, or to not care. I suppose you could try to force your ideas on them, but it won’t work. Go your own way and live your truth.

"
20 may 2019,scorpio,"Stop selling yourself short, Scorpio. You may think that you don’t have the chops to pull something off. As though maybe you need more skills, a better resume or more talent. Wrong! You DO have what it takes, and if anyone tries to convince you otherwise, then tell them to find someone else to troll.

"
21 may 2019,scorpio,"Ah, Scorpio—the sexiest, sultriest, most mysterious sign of the zodiac. You will be at your most magnetic best in the weeks to come. Both the Sun and Mercury glide into your eighth house of libido and passion today. This sector also deals with shamanism, psychic encounters and the metaphysical, so dive right in—this is your  wheelhouse.

"
22 may 2019,scorpio,"“If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.” That’s the message the cosmos has for you, Scorpio. It’s time to start associating with people who are different, the kind who know how to live. If life has seemed a bit boring lately, find others who know how to shake things up.

"
23 may 2019,scorpio,"Team work makes the dream work? Uh……maybe. People may not be willing to do their jobs. Or maybe they need someone to lead them. Perhaps they need a visionary, which definitely could be you! But you’re better off leading by example than by force.

"
24 may 2019,scorpio,"What you want and what other people want could be two totally different things today, Scorpio. If you can agree to disagree, that’s fine. But a Venus-Moon square indicates that agreements won’t be easy! No problem. Wait until tomorrow when the aspects are much better.

"
25 may 2019,scorpio,"People often don’t realize how grounded you Scorpios can be. They’re too busy focusing on your mysterious personality, trying to figure out what makes you tick. You’re in quite a practical place right now, so don’t hide behind that veil of secrecy. Let others know exactly what’s on your mind.

"
26 may 2019,scorpio,"Carpe diem! Just start living for the moment, Scorpio. There’s only so much planning you can do. And remember this…you don’t need the blessing of other people in order to live day by day. If others are being cranky and stressed out you don’t have to be a part of their pity party. Stay in your own little bubble of contentment.

"
27 may 2019,scorpio,"This is a real firecracker of a day, Scorpio! It’s always good when planets in your house of creativity wink at planets in your house of taking chances. That’s what’s happening, but there is a special twist. The North Node of the moon is activated. The node helps you determine your life’s path. What are you waiting for?

"
28 may 2019,scorpio,"It’s going to take people some time to figure out that you’re right. Fortunately, with your typical casual attitude, you won’t give a hoot if takes them a decade to figure out that 2 + 2=4. Just don’t snicker too much at them, okay?

"
29 may 2019,scorpio,"Scorpions can deliver one hell of a wallop with their legendary stingers, and you may be tempted to do that today. A Mercury-Neptune meltdown stirs up drama and the subsequent stinky emotions. Be careful, my friend: you may lash out at someone close. Remember, once those words are out of your mouth (or you hit the send button) they can’t be taken back.

"
30 may 2019,scorpio,"Start thinking more long term when it comes to your financial picture. For example, a new job may pay more, but will it help you create true wealth? Or are you better off staying where you are and starting a side hustle? Do you really need that luxury item, or would it be smarter to invest that cash in a mutual fund? Take more time to consider your options.

"
31 may 2019,scorpio,"Ggrrr!!! Aren’t you the envy of the zodiac. The two planets of love, Venus and Neptune, are all huggy-kissy face today, which should make everyone happy. But in your case they happen to be in houses that deal with flirting and sex appeal and commitment. Listen, I know that you’re used to being the sex bomb of the cosmos. It’s just that today you have SO much more of an unfair advantage over mere mortals!

"
1 june 2019,scorpio,"You need to know what’s going on in someone’s mind: where they’re coming from, what’s going to happen next. A Jupiter-Venus aspect warns that your usual techniques won’t work, whatever they may be. So consider how you can get the results you want, with diplomacy and a quiet calm.

"
2 june 2019,scorpio,"Sometimes you’re content with letting everyone try to figure things out for themselves. After all, why waste valuable time in pointing out the obvious? But today is a good time to communicate. Tell it to them straight (but be diplomatic in the process).

"
3 june 2019,scorpio,"The new moon in Gemini can work wonders for both your financial and romantic lives. It occurs in your eighth house of net worth, sex and intimacy. But in order for this to happen, you have to be operating with calm logic, not emotions and drama. Don’t let your heart override your head.

"
4 june 2019,scorpio,"“You never know unless you try.” That’s the message behind today’s new Moon in the most adventurous part of your chart. Life is too short to stay stuck in the same old circumstances, Scorpio. You don’t have to quit the day job and join a hippie commune. Take smaller, calculated risks if need be. One of them will build on the ones before, and soon your life will be markedly different.

"
6 june 2019,scorpio,"Being open minded will get you a lot further than being rigid. With the Moon in the most free thinking part of your chart, you should consider someone else’s viewpoint. To your surprise, you may discover that they’re on to something. There’s nothing wrong with admitting that other people have smarts too!

"
7 june 2019,scorpio,"You’ve got game, something that other people will notice over the next few days. Beating you is going to be mighty difficult, so don’t be surprised if others want to be on Team Scorpio.

"
11 june 2019,scorpio,"You and someone close may not see eye to eye today, but that’s no reason to get into an argument. Let it be. By the time Thursday rolls around you’ll be in a much better place to communicate with each other. Maybe you’ll have to use a different approach but it should work.

"
12 june 2019,scorpio,"Don’t be surprised if wanderlust hits you hard. Pack a bag and go, my friend! Or at least start looking into some travel options. Don’t let guilt or responsibilities hold you back. Life is too short to keep things on a bucket list.

"
13 june 2019,scorpio,"“The pen is mightier than the sword.”  “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.” What you say and how you say it count for a lot, Scorpio. Make sure that your words are concise but not too forceful. Eloquence may not be found often in this world, but people know it when they see and hear it!

"
14 june 2019,scorpio,"Let your freak flag fly! This is one of the best days in 2019 to cut loose, and I’m not referring to merely partying (although you could do that too). High octane Mars and inspirational Neptune are telling you to cut any ties that bind you to a boring old self-image and lifestyle. You’ve played it safe long enough. Where has it gotten you?

"
15 june 2019,scorpio,"How high can you fly? The answer to that question depends on you. Right now you’re in the kind of a place where if you can think it, you can do it. And don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

"
16 june 2019,scorpio,"Words are like a double-edged sword–they can cut to the bone, or they can drive a point home with accuracy. Make sure that your words are of the gentler kind today. A difficult Saturn aspect may make it tempting to be blunt, but this will backfire. Use a little honey instead.

"
17 june 2019,scorpio,"First the good news: there’s a glistening full moon in your income sector tonight. You could land a raise, a higher paying job somewhere else or snag a big revenue source  (if you’re self-employed). Now for the warnings: deceptive Neptune is in a tough angle to the moon. Don’t take your newfound cash and start splurging on luxury items. And if you’re in a creative line of work, make sure that you’re going to get paid for your efforts.

"
18 june 2019,scorpio,"You need to loosen up a little, Scorpio. Schedules and goals all have a purpose but sometimes ya just gotta chill out and seize the day. Don’t be so focused on getting from Point A to Point B that you lose sight of that.

"
19 june 2019,scorpio,"They say that talk is cheap, and that pretty much sums up today’s cosmic energy. A Mars-Pluto opposition will bring out the people who are all bluster but no action. They could try to twist your arm into doing something, but with aggressive Mars in your house of higher order thinking, they won’t get too far!

"
20 june 2019,scorpio,"Don’t get too pushy in a close relationship. From your chart it appears that things seem to be shifting in ways that you weren’t expecting. Neptune is going retrograde tomorrow, which will actually help you sort things out.

"
21 june 2019,scorpio,"Adventure is calling your name, Scorpio! The Sun is in Cancer, the most progressive part of your chart. Taking a chance in love or business is favored, along with taking classes and traveling to exotic locales. Neptune retrogrades in your house of romance and creativity, indicating that it’s time to review whether you’re playing it to safe or not. If a person or situation is holding you back, pay attention.

"
22 june 2019,scorpio,"Yesterday inspirational Neptune began to retrograde in your house of romance and creativity. With the Moon now in this part of your chart, it’s a good time to ask yourself where you can add more juice to your life! Considering that a solar eclipse will soon take place in your house of breaking the rules, it’s a good time to view yourself in a new light.

"
23 june 2019,scorpio,"Wishing and hoping that things will magically change just isn’t going to work, Scorpio. The buck stops with you. It’s your responsibility to create better habits, connections and attitudes. You’ll start to realize this on Wednesday when Mercury enters the most authoritative part of your chart.

"
24 june 2019,scorpio,"You have so much to offer the world: why are you hiding on the sidelines? A Venus-Neptune square may be shaking your confidence but this won’t last long. By midweek you’ll start feeling like you’re in control. 

"
25 june 2019,scorpio,"People at the office could be quite demanding and from your chart it looks like you’ve had enough of it. Chiron, the wounded healer, is telling you to set some boundaries. Otherwise you’ll just become resentful and burned out. besides, Mercury enters your career sector tomorrow, so you’ll be able to move on if necessary!

"
26 june 2019,scorpio,"Got #goals? I sure hope so, because strategic Mercury is now in the most ambitious part of your chart. Between now and July 7th you need to take action on the things that mean the most to you. Once the 7th rolls around, the messenger planet retrogrades, but this is actually beneficial. It will give you time to review.

"
28 june 2019,scorpio,"Your words carry weight so use them wisely. It’s a smart time to get your message out there, whatever that may mean: explaining your feelings to a lover, promoting your brand or trying to create change in the world. July will be an intensely busy month for this, so get started now.

"
29 june 2019,scorpio,"Scorpios never back away from a challenge and that holds true today! With shrewd Mercury in the most ambitious part of your chart you’re able to make progress on something that’s important to you. The best part is that you won’t have to run anyone over to succeed; you may actually have support.

"
30 june 2019,scorpio,"You may be tempted to go down a particular path, but what will the cost be? Maybe it’s excessive money or time. Perhaps it’s too much of an emotional commitment. Think before you act.

"
1 july 2019,scorpio,"Prepare for liftoff! High octane Mars zips into your house of ambition and success, and it is determined to get results. You might want to cool those jets, though–Mercury retrogrades here from the 7th through the 19th. Now’s a good time for planning and scheming.

"
2 july 2019,scorpio,"People may be talking at you, trying to knock some sense into your head. But are you sure that they know what they’re talking about? If you have any doubts about that, then stick with your own wisdom.

"
3 july 2019,scorpio,"Nothing, and I mean nothing,  is going to hold you back, Scorpio! Today Venus glides into the most optimistic and daring part of your chart, drawing to you the people and resources you need . Oh….and there’s a whopping solar eclipse taking place there too. You are going to become a force to contend with. But with Saturn in a tense angle, you must remember to plot and plan carefully rather than just diving in.

"
4 july 2019,scorpio,"The naysayers are out there in force today, so unless you want them bursting your shiny red balloon, stay away. Focus instead on your audacious plans, which were set in motion with yesterday’s eclipse. By the way, the trolls will still be out there (on the 9th, 14th and 17th) so avoid them and do your own thing.

"
5 july 2019,scorpio,"Your creativity soars thanks to inspirational Neptune in a fabulous spot! This is a big holiday weekend in the US, but don’t let this energy go to waste. Your career and money situation can improve a lot over the next six months if you’re willing to try something new.

"
6 july 2019,scorpio,"This is a great weekend for cutting loose and hanging out with the tribe! With the Moon in your house of friends and networking, you should be heading to the beach or out to dinner with the people you enjoy the most. There’s a sense of adventure and trying something new, so don’t stick with the same old haunts.

"
7 july 2019,scorpio,"Major goals start to go under review as Mercury retrogrades in your house of ambition and success. One of the things you may be asking yourself is this: am I playing it too safe? With so much planetary activity in your house of taking risks, you may decide to push yourself a bit further than is comfortable. But nothing ventured, nothing gained!

"
8 july 2019,scorpio,"Good luck if anyone tries to dictate to you how you should live your life. A terrific Venus-Uranus aspect will not only make you feel adventurous, it will also put you in the path of like minded people. Surround yourself with the best.

"
9 july 2019,scorpio,"“Your beliefs become your thoughts, your thoughts become your words, your words become your actions.” These words from Gandhi ring true for you today and into the future. Make sure that your thoughts and beliefs are taking you places that you really want to go.

"
10 july 2019,scorpio,"It ain’t easy being charismatic and bold, but you have the chops to pull it off. A magnificent Sun-Neptune trine in the most optimistic and creative parts of your chart puts you front and center. Yeah, I know, you love being mysterious and in the shadows. Not today, my friend! Soak up the limelight.

"
11 july 2019,scorpio,"Diplomacy will be in short supply as Mars squares volatile Uranus. People will be convinced that their opinion is the best and won’t be willing to budge. Creative solutions will start to appear tomorrow and over the weekend.

"
12 july 2019,scorpio,"Sometimes you need a delicate touch to get what you want, rather than coming on too strong. You’ll be able to do just that over the weekend thanks to a gentle Venus-Moon aspect. Smile sweetly and ask away.

"
13 july 2019,scorpio,"Even if your financial situation is not where you’d like it to be, you can make inroads today. Yup, it’s a Saturday but that doesn’t mean that you can’t do some research about other options. Abundant Jupiter, planet of profits, meets up with the passionate Moon in your income sector. Is it time to follow your bliss?

"
14 july 2019,scorpio,"The upcoming eclipse in Capricorn is stirring up your brain waves, which could prompt you to open your mouth and let loose. The problem is that you may come across as being too forceful and this could backfire. Besides, other people have valuable opinions that you should be listening to right now.

"
15 july 2019,scorpio,"You could be quite vocal today, but this is a good thing! The passionate, emotional Moon swings past Pluto and Saturn in your house of communicating. Say what’s on your mind, because your words have power and conviction. People will take notice.

"
16 july 2019,scorpio,"Yowza! A scintillating lunar eclipse puts the final touches on some kind of project that showcases your thinking, writing or speaking skills. It could be career related, such as a screenplay, marketing campaign or contract negotiation. But it also could be personal, like planning an epic party or becoming more of a social butterfly. People may be surprised and even a little pissy, but you’ll be having too much fun to notice.

"
17 july 2019,scorpio,"Play by the rules today, Scorpio. Say what you mean and mean what you say. Think things through first. This is not a good time to be flying by the seat of your pants, saying whatever pops into your mind. Things will loosen up next week.

"
18 july 2019,scorpio,"It’s not easy being charismatic, sexy and fabulous, but somebody’s gotta do it. It looks like it’s your turn, Scorpio! A wonderful Venus-Neptune trine makes you the person to look at and admire today. Make sure that you put on a good show.

"
19 july 2019,scorpio,"Taking bigger risks in life was the theme of the July 3rd eclipse. You’ll be feeling the energy of this lunation for months to come, as new opportunities will come your way. But which ones to choose? Hmm. Fortunately Mercury enters this sector today, helping you to narrow down the possibilities. It’s retrograde, which isn’t a bad thing–it’s positive, as it will make you more reflective.

"
20 july 2019,scorpio,"“Read my lips!” People could demand that you follow their words and instructions to the letter. If it’s a boss or some kind of authority figure, you’d better listen. But if it’s not, that’s another story! Don’t get bullied into following someone else’s rules or agenda if you don’t have to.

"
21 july 2019,scorpio,"For the past four weeks the Sun has been in your house of big picture, blue sky thinking. Hopefully you’ve been considering ways to bust out of a rut and live a bolder lifestyle! This goes for any area of your life, by the way. El Sol is getting ready to leave tomorrow, but today it shakes hands with strategic Mercury. The time for day dreaming is over, so buckle down and plan your next move.

"
22 july 2019,scorpio,"The next four weeks promise to be game changers, Scorpio. Mars is in your tenth house of ambition and success for the first time in two years. The Sun arrives today and Venus shows up on Saturday. With all of this planetary firepower in the most driven part of your chart, you will be unstoppable. Naturally this can positively affect your career, but love, health, friendships and travel are also covered. It’s whatever floats your boat!

"
23 july 2019,scorpio,"It seems like your popularity is on the rise and everyone wants a piece of you! But it’s not just your personality that people are attracted to. You have a can-do attitude which is appealing. Let’s face it, people want to surround themselves with movers and shakers–and that’s what you are.

"
24 july 2019,scorpio,"Your popularity is on the rise at the moment, so don’t even think about crawling back into that protective shell. Yes, I know, you love being mysterious and aloof. But a Mercury-Venus conjunction is shining a big spotlight on you so soak up the attention. Besides, with so much planetary action of achieving important goals, it’s a good thing to be noticed right now.

"
25 july 2019,scorpio,"Your luck in career and money matters is on the rise, so hustle while you can. An auspicious Mars-Jupiter meet up could bring a job offer, new client or increased revenues for your business. This energy is going to be powerful for the following week; be ready to showcase your talent and negotiate like a pro.

"
26 july 2019,scorpio,"Uh, you may need to readjust the way you communicate with others, Scorpio. Aggressive Mars is making you a tad too forceful. There’s nothing wrong with having an opinion or a vision, but you should chill out when it comes to expressing what’s on your mind. Your spoken and written words need to be mature, calm and well thought out.

"
27 july 2019,scorpio,"Good heavens, you’re motivated. The Sun and Mars are in your house of goal achievement and today Venus joins them. If one of your cherished plans is to find serious love, or to make an existing relationship stronger, then this planetary trifecta will help. We crave serious, mature romance when this part of our chart is lit up: no affairs, flings or senseless drama allowed.

"
28 july 2019,scorpio,"Things should start to develop a nice flow. You’ve been pushing hard in all areas of your life and it’s high time that things aren’t always a struggle. This will last for a few weeks, by the way, so enjoy it.

"
29 july 2019,scorpio,"Rebelling against the rules is not a smart way to go today. Nor is taking a “my way or the highway” approach. People in positions of power may notice your attitude, and they’ll remember it. Instead, just suck it up and act like a team player, even if you don’t feel like it. By Wednesday you’ll be back in the driver’s seat.

"
30 july 2019,scorpio,"If you want to make a good impression on people, then let your talent and skills speak for themselves. There’s no need to brag or push hard. You can be the best mom, dad, lover, employee or friend by letting people see that you have an open, creative mind. It’s the people who are rigid who often have the most trouble getting along with others!

"
31 july 2019,scorpio,"You are at the brink of some amazing cosmic aspects, Scorpio. Today Mercury resumes direct motion in your house of taking risks and living more authentically. Then tomorrow there is a new moon in the most ambitious, successful part of your chart! This is really good stuff. Nothing is holding you back, and you’re gonna love it.

"
1 august 2019,scorpio,"Feeling motivated? You should be, considering that a new moon is taking place in the most ambitious part of your chart! Over the next few weeks you can move mountains, but I warn you–you’ll most likely be moving them by yourself. Not everyone in your world wants to be a team player. Of course, once they see what you achieve, they’ll wish that they had been on your side.

"
2 august 2019,scorpio,"Someone may be intent to undermine your authority, or some kind of plan that you’re working on. And it could come as a surprise too. No problem….let them think they’ve succeeded. They haven’t, something they’ll find out the hard way next week, oh around Wednesday. You will be in the driver’s seat and the trolls will just end up as roadkill.

"
3 august 2019,scorpio,"Take a break from your frenetic schedule and party with your friends, why dontcha. Or a lover; someone who knows how to have a good time. You have SO much intense planetary energy going on in the ambition part of your chart that you run the risk of burning out. Recharge your batteries all weekend long because next week is going to be 120 mph all the way.

"
4 august 2019,scorpio,"Put your money where your mouth is, Scorpio. It’s time to go loud and proud about your talent. Crush it on social media. Negotiate like a champ. Strategize like a five-star general. This energy returns on Friday, so you have the entire week to make things happen.

"
5 august 2019,scorpio,"You’re no stranger to mystery. Nor are you afraid to turn up the sex appeal. Therefore you’ll absolutely love today’s sizzling Moon-Neptune aspect. It’s a time to satisfy your fantasies and feel alive. Take advantage of it, because there is a LOT of energy later in the week in your career sector….and you’ll be back to taking care of business.

"
6 august 2019,scorpio,"Feeling a bit territorial? Not surprising with a Moon-Uranus opposition. People could be unpredictable and you won’t be in the mood for their nonsense. Inner balance means a lot to you. So if it looks like anyone intends to rain on your parade, you’ll protect your serenity….as you should.

"
7 august 2019,scorpio,"Lady Luck–otherwise known as the planet Jupiter–is smiling at you for the next few days! Considering that the gas giant is in your house of income and savings, you are in an awesome position to bolster your earnings. Jupiter trines the Sun in your house of goals, indicating that other important dreams of yours could also come to pass. It’s all about building a strong foundation, something that you long to do.

"
8 august 2019,scorpio,"Confidence is sexy and you’ve got plenty of it! A simmering Venus-Jupiter trine brings out your personal magnetism. Use this to impress muckety mucks in the business world. Let a lover know that you’re a damn good catch (although a bit of humility might be in order). Things that you set in motion now will have long term consequences that you’ll enjoy.

"
9 august 2019,scorpio,"A show of force is not needed today. If you want to get your way–and we know  that you do–the best way to go about it is to be chilled out and eloquent, rather than getting in someone’s face. This is an important time, as the decisions you make and plans that you set in motion will have long lasting consequences. Don’t let impatience take over.

"
10 august 2019,scorpio,"Heaven knows you’re no stranger to drama. But emotional ups and downs can exact a toll on your energy levels and happiness. A Sun-Neptune aspect suggest that you reconsider just how much drama you want to accept in your life. Is it time to dial it down a notch?

"
11 august 2019,scorpio,"Lookin’ good, Scorpio. Jupiter goes direct in your house of income, opening up doors that may have been closed over the past few months. Then smart Mercury joins the Sun in your success sector. This all bodes well for making progress, but is a lover or business partner on board? That’s the question as Uranus starts to retrograde in your house of serious relationships.

"
12 august 2019,scorpio,"You say what you mean and you mean what you say! A powerful Saturn-Moon aspect enables you to get your point across in a big way. No screaming or ultimatums though. Just direct statements that leave no one in doubt as to where you stand. Who says that Scorpios are always so damn mysterious?

"
13 august 2019,scorpio,"You’re not one to suffer fools gladly, and today’s planetary action will put you to the test. That’s because the fools are out there en masse. What to do? Tell them that they have their heads up their rear ends? Or just let them figure it out for themselves, which could take a long time? That’s up to you to decide.

"
14 august 2019,scorpio,"You have a sexy, confident swagger about you….but then you already knew that, didn’t you? You’re probably saying to yourself “that’s  the big cosmic story today?”  It is, so cut me some slack. Go out there and strut your stuff. And if you’re one of the few Scorpios out there whose self-esteem is in the toilet, today’s Sun-Venus aspect is perfect for getting your mojo back.

"
15 august 2019,scorpio,"Major decisions about your family and home life need to be made, and now is the best time in 2019 to do so. The Aquarius full moon highlights your domestic situation. This sector also governs your inner sense of well being and comfort, so make a vow to live with a sense of serenity. Changes will probably have to be made in order to do that, but it will be worth it.

"
16 august 2019,scorpio,"Boundaries need to be set with people. This may not be something you want to do, but from your chart it appears to be necessary. Calmly let them know that you’re not going to be put upon. Better yet, set a good example for them. Next week the energy changes in your favor as planets start to move into the teamwork part of your chart.

"
17 august 2019,scorpio,"Sometimes in life it seems as though we’re not being heard, as if our opinions don’t count. You could feel this today due to a Saturn-North Node opposition. Next week brings some interesting aspects as planets move into your house of connecting with others. Are you associating with the right kind of people? if not you’ll have the chance to meet some new ones!

"
18 august 2019,scorpio,"Who says that you’re standoffish and secretive? Please! You’re going to be the life of the party wherever you go, Scorpio. That’s because high octane Mars just entered Virgo, your eleventh house of networking. You can use this energy for making new friends or finding a lover. Make new business connections. Join a volunteer organization. Some amazing new connections are coming your way.

"
19 august 2019,scorpio,"Your confidence gets a boost from a Mercury-Moon aspect. The realization hits you that yes, I CAN do this! Break big things down into little bite sized chunks, and “nibble” on one little chunk at a time. Process is the key.

"
20 august 2019,scorpio,"The Sun will be leaving your house of goals in a few days. From your chart it appears that you’re frantically trying to catch up on things, but please….take it easy! You’ll be able to get more help from others over the next four weeks. Stop trying to do everything on your own.

"
21 august 2019,scorpio,"You have been the go-getter of the zodiac for the past four weeks, but now it’s time to relax a little. Vivacious Venus enters your house of friends and partying, so start making plans. New people could come into your life too, especially after the new moon on the 30th. The biggest problem will be rationing your time with people so they don’t feel left out!

"
22 august 2019,scorpio,"You may be convinced that you’ve got everything under control, and you’re probably right. But doing things the same old way will get you predictable results. Why not try a more creative method? If you need a mentor then wait until the Sun enters your house of networking and wisdom tomorrow.

"
23 august 2019,scorpio,"It’s time to crawl out of your protective shell, Scorpio! And you can put the stinger away too, as the Sun rolls into the friendliest part of your chart. You are in for one really  lively month ahead. Expect friends, lovers (notice that’s plural) and business colleagues to be texting you, setting up dinner dates. But you could also make some exciting new acquaintances, and that’s likely yo happen next week.

"
24 august 2019,scorpio,"OK, we get it…you’re the sexiest sign of the zodiac. Which means that today’s Venus-Mars meetup is just one more excuse for you to enjoy the sensual side of life. But these planets are joining forces in your house of networking and hanging out with friends, so don’t hide away with a lover. You can enjoy their company later in the evening! For now, make plans to hang out with the tribe first.

"
25 august 2019,scorpio,"The way a team, family or group handles things needs to be revised, for everyone’s sanity! But that doesn’t mean that you should push too hard to make those changes. Sometimes people need to figure things out for themselves. A little prodding on your part may be all that’s needed.

"
26 august 2019,scorpio,"People could be unusually cooperative and true to your Scorpio nature, you’ll be saying “what’s the catch?”  The fact is that there is none. Sparkling Uranus is in a diplomatic mood, making friends, team members and colleagues a lot more easy going than usual. This energy runs til the end of the week so work it!

"
27 august 2019,scorpio,"“Group think” is an issue today as people are determined to keep everyone in line. The problem is, you have no intention or desire to think like everyone else (so what else is new?). You can try to fight these limited people or do what you do best–pull away and think your usual sarcastic, yet realistic, thoughts.

"
28 august 2019,scorpio,"People could be in a hurry to partner up with you, both in business and your personal life! It’s not surprising, considering all of the good things you have going for you. The only problem is selecting who you’re going to allow in. This isn’t ruthless, it’s smart. Friday’s new moon occurs in your house of networking and it’s going to open up a lot of doors.

"
29 august 2019,scorpio,"Mercury zips into your house of friends and networking, encouraging you to socialize more. However, this also happens to be the house where you hold cherished dreams and values. Do the people in your world share your ideals? If not, then tomorrow’s new moon is the perfect time to align with like minded souls.

"
30 august 2019,scorpio,"People could be touchy these days, demanding more of your time and attention than you can give. That’s because of all of the planetary action in your networking sector. A new moon occurs here today, bringing in even more potential friends, lovers and colleagues! It may reach a point where you’re going to have to select who stays and who goes. Hint: drop the people who don’t truly support you.

"
31 august 2019,scorpio,"Balancing your time between family, friends and a lover could be a challenge right now. Are you stretched too thin? If there are other commitments that are cutting into quality time with these people, you need to make some serious decisions. Over the next three weeks spending time with people who count is of paramount importance.

"
1 september 2019,scorpio,"Don’t be surprised if you’re surrounded by people who want to get to know you better! An amazingly social energy is going on in your chart right now, and your personal magnetism is running high. Joining a volunteer organization, club or sports team is a great idea too. The more, the merrier.

"
2 september 2019,scorpio,"Social activities are picking up steam thanks to loads of planetary activity in your house of friends and networking! However, watch your spending. If people are planning extravagant bachelorette parties or weddings don’t feel as though you have to lay out the cash. The same goes for expensive dinners, drinks and clothing. It’s great to have fun, but going broke in the process doesn’t make any sense.

"
3 september 2019,scorpio,"Momentum is building in your house of friends and networking, so expect to be busy socializing and schmoozing! However, when it comes to teamwork, some people may be slacking off. Or maybe they don’t truly understand what is expected of them. Make it clear, otherwise things will go off the rails.

"
4 september 2019,scorpio,"Feel caught between a rock and a hard place? It might seem that way, especially when it comes to the people in your life who may be at odds with each other. Avoid taking sides and be as objective as possible. You don’t want to get involved in this! (FYI: this energy returns on Saturday).

"
5 september 2019,scorpio,"Advice from a friend or mentor could be incredibly helpful, so don’t feel shy about asking their opinion. If you’re not convinced that someone you already know has the right answers then seek out someone new. This could be an online authority as intelligent Mercury is lighting up your technology sector.

"
6 september 2019,scorpio,"For heaven’s sake, stop nitpicking and focusing on every little thing that displeases you. There is fabulous cosmic energy encouraging you to get together with friends for drinks or dinner. The weekend is almost here–why not go to an event that involves a hobby or interest of yours? Think antiques show, ComicCon, a dog show, flea market, street fair. You can nitpick later if you feel like it!

"
1 january 2019,sagittarius,"2019 is shaping up to be your year, Sagittarius. With abundant Jupiter in your sign for the first time in over a decade, there’s nothing holding you back….except you! And that’s not going to happen. So pull out a piece of paper and make your bucket list. Cheers!

"
2 january 2019,sagittarius,"If making more money is part of your 2019 plan, today is the time to take action. Saturn, the planet of discipline and long term success, meets up with the fiery Sun in your income sector. The decisions you make will be well thought out and balanced.

"
3 january 2019,sagittarius,"Loved ones could be acting up today, laying on guilt trips or acting wonky. With intelligent Mercury in your sign, though, you’ll see right through it. Just laugh it off and keep going about your day.

"
4 january 2019,sagittarius,"Shrewd Mercury enters your money sector, good news for those of you who want to earn (and save) more this year. The planets are lining up to bring you more stability in all areas of your life. The eclipse next Sunday is a game changer, so be prepared to create a stronger foundation.

"
5 january 2019,sagittarius,"It’s OK to dig back into the past and hash out old memories! Sometimes this can be painful, but today it’s advisable. You’ll be able to come to some fresh new understandings about yourself and other people. Forgive, forget and move on.

"
6 january 2019,sagittarius,"Things are going to start picking up momentum for you, archer. Erratic Uranus goes direct in your house of romance, enabling matters of the heart to run more smoothly. In an interesting coincidence, a solar eclipse occurs in your house of stability. This sector also governs your income, so between now and July you could definitely pull in more dinero.

"
7 january 2019,sagittarius,"Damn, you’re looking good. That’s because gorgeous Venus is now in your sign! And if you think your self-image could use an update, the next three weeks are a good time for a makeover.

"
9 january 2019,sagittarius,"Life’s too short to play by the rules, something that your sign is perfectly aware of. And today is a good time to toss aside your worries and have some fun. Even if you have  to go to work, try to carve out some play time later. Unless, of course, you decide to call in sick……but I won’t tell.

"
10 january 2019,sagittarius,"It’s a great day for reminiscing about the past. Honor your ancestors by going through old photos. Light a candle for them and say a prayer of thanks. Contact an older relative and learn more about their life story; you might be surprised at what you discover.

"
11 january 2019,sagittarius,"Money matters shouldn’t be getting the best of you, Sagittarius. You should be in control of it…..not the other way around. Which is why you need to pay attention to today’s cosmic energy. Transformational Pluto has your back, encouraging you to get on track with earning more and saving more.

"
12 january 2019,sagittarius,"This weekend is a bit wonky. Today you could be operating on pure emotion and passion. By tomorrow your mind will be all logic and rational thinking. But somewhere in the middle you could find a sweet spot!

"
13 january 2019,sagittarius,"Don’t kid yourself about an important issue. Likewise, don’t let others use guilt or memories of the “good old times” in order to manipulate you. What counts right now is a strong foundation. Do you have one?

"
14 january 2019,sagittarius,"You’re known as being one of the fiercest signs of the zodiac. But today’s energy encourages you to be a homebody. Take a break from the rat race. Pour yourself a glass of wine. Read a book. Recharge your batteries.

"
15 january 2019,sagittarius,"Surround yourself with people who are willing to chip in and get things done, archer. There is no room in your life for flakes or hangers on. Make sure that everyone knows what their roles are as well as the deadlines. This is just as true in your personal life as it is in your professional one.

"
16 january 2019,sagittarius,"Consider fresh new ways to eat and nourish your body. With so much planetary activity in your house of habits and health, this is the perfect time to change your routines.

"
17 january 2019,sagittarius,"
With sultry Venus in your sign you’re bound to draw attention to yourself. The question is: do you want it? Maybe not today. But tomorrow is another story completely!

"
18 january 2019,sagittarius,"
You’re playing for keeps. Not only when it comes to love, or money, but every single area of your life. Which means that you are a force to contend with.

"
19 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Drama and adventure are two different things. Adventure is generally a good thing as it pushes us past previous limits and enriches our life experience. Drama, on the other hand, can be downright debilitating. Make sure you’re choosing the right people and circumstances in your life.

"
20 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Got a lot on your mind? Then you’re in a good place. The Sun enters Aquarius, your third house of thinking, speaking, writing and getting your message out to the world. This is a great time for socializing, finding new love or developing your brand. Just don’t let anyone butt in to your business.

"
21 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Your sign is famous for entering where angels fear to tread. So you’re going to love today’s cosmic activity: a lunar eclipse in your house of adventure! But even an intrepid archer needs to take their time. Disciplined Saturn warns you to make sure there is a steady foundation underneath your feet before you take flight.

"
22 january 2019,sagittarius,"
This could easily be one of the luckiest days of the year for you, Sagittarius. That’s because magnetic Venus and lucky Jupiter meet up in your sign. If you haven’t figured out what you’d like to accomplish yet in 2019, today is a fabulous day for thinking about it….and then taking action.

"
23 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Your head and your heart are not working in sync today. Well, since you can’t trust either one, don’t! Wait until tomorrow when intelligent Mercury enters your house of thinking. 

"
24 january 2019,sagittarius,"
You’re turning into quite the brainiac! The mighty Sun entered your house of thinking and communicating on Sunday, and today shrewd Mercury goes there too. While other people fantasize, you can actually dream big and make it happen.

"
25 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Call the fire department! You’re the hottest thing on two legs. With look-at-me Mars winking at lucky Jupiter, you’ll be turning heads. It’s a great time to show off your “stuff”: that gorgeous face but also your portfolio, resume or wealth of ideas.

"
26 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Friends and lovers could be agitated today, so stay out of their path….and out of their personal arguments with other people. If you want to schedule a “play date” with yourself, that’s not such a bad idea.

"
27 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Your sign is famous for being bold and outspoken, but today isn’t the time to go loud and proud. The Moon is in a tough spot from the confidentiality sector, indicating that you need to keep some things to yourself. Hidden detractors could be out there waiting to pounce.

"
28 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Why not be a little coy today, Sagittarius? The entire world doesn’t need to know what you’re thinking or planning. A little mystery can be a good thing. 

"
29 january 2019,sagittarius,"
This is one of the best days in 2019 to get your message out there, whatever that may mean. Writers, bloggers, students, teachers, lecturers: you should be on fire. So should sales/marketing people and artists. But you can also use this energy to flirt or tell someone how much you care.

"
30 january 2019,sagittarius,"
“Take your passion and make it happen!” That line comes from the ’80’s movie “Flashdance”. No, I’m not telling you to get out your ripped sweatshirts and dance leggings. I’m telling you to after what makes your heart sing. 

"
31 january 2019,sagittarius,"
Rules may be rules that doesn’t mean that they’re set in stone. Stop living life by someone else’s agenda. Even if you have to–like at the office–you can still change things up a little.

"
1 february 2019,sagittarius,"
A stubborn Mars-Pluto square could make you feel confined and ready to bust out into a new groove.  Don’t waste your energy raging against the machine; wait until tomorrow, when you can do this without the anger!

"
2 february 2019,sagittarius,"
This is the last day that magnetic Venus will be in your sign for awhile, so work it, honey. Unpredictable Uranus could put you in the path of someone who finds you quite interesting. 

"
3 february 2019,sagittarius,"
You don’t need to be aggressive to get ahead in business or money matters. Magnetic Venus is now in your house of income. Yes, you’ll still have to put in the effort. But you won’t have to bash people over the head to reach your goals.

"
4 february 2019,sagittarius,"
This is one of the best times in 2019 to network, socialize and get your message out there. The Aquarius new Moon occurs in your house of self-expression. Use it to flirt, get a new job, make new friends or to simply party hearty.

"
5 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Keep everything on the level today. Say what you mean and mean what you say. There is no need for blustering or buttering people up. Just be you, straightforward as usual.

"
6 february 2019,sagittarius,"
There is a LOT of planetary activity in your house of thinking and communicating, so much so that you may feel as though your brain is fried. Take some down time today just for yourself and get quiet. Meditate, read a good book, have a glass of wine and just chill.

"
7 february 2019,sagittarius,"
People around you may be in need of your support, and this is a good time to help them. With optimistic Jupiter in your sign you have the warmth, charisma and wisdom to make a difference in someone’s life.

"
8 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Creative ideas could be buzzing through your mind at lightning like speed. No problem with that! These are thoughts that you can take to the bank. Or ideas for a fabulous party. Maybe you want to ask someone out. Does your self-image need a makeover? Go for it! 

"
9 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Do not…..I repeat, do not….get locked in to a particular plan or schedule today! Especially if it involves the food store, cleaning your house, yada yada yada. Spunky Uranus is telling you to drop everything and HAVE SOME FUN. 

"
10 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Get things out in the open with loved ones, Sagittarius. Holding things in doesn’t help anyone. Over the next few weeks you can make a lot of headway.

"
13 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Something quite unexpected in the love department could happen, something fast and possibly delightful. But you could also go head to head with a lover and have a spat. Don’t say words that you can’t take back.

"
14 february 2019,sagittarius,"
Get physical with your honey this Valentine’s Day! Sexy Mars just zipped into your house of sports and vitality. Diet and exercise together through the end of March. Single archers could find love wherever people are active, such as the gym, beach or tennis court.

"
16 february 2019,sagittarius,"
People may use guilt, fear or other “interesting” emotions to try to get their way, Sagittarius. But with tough guy Pluto in a practical place, you’ll have none of it. If that means letting others know they’ve crossed a line, so be it.

"
24 february 2019,sagittarius,"
There is a successor guru out there who says that “your income can only grow to the level that your mind grows.” In other words, if you think you’re going to always be broke, you will be. Transformative Pluto is active in your earnings sector today, helping you feel more confident about pulling in big bucks.

"
10 march 2019,sagittarius,"
You’re going to be in a highly practical state of mind today and for the rest of the week. But that doesn’t mean that others will be. No problem. What matters is your inner peace and contentment.

"
11 march 2019,sagittarius,"
You can never tell if a certain project or idea is going to work out. But with disciplined Saturn in your house of creating rituals and routines, you are in excellent position to build success into whatever it is that you’re planning. Just make sure to remain flexible in the process.

"
12 march 2019,sagittarius,"
You may be feeling upbeat and full of swagger, but the people around you could be down in the dumps. What’s an archer to do–join this freakin’ pity party? Methinks not! Let them snap out of it and talk with them tomorrow when the mood changes.

"
13 march 2019,sagittarius,"
You like to go with the flow, but right now you need to structure your days and routines. Before you start screaming “But that’s not fun!”, know that the Sun enters your house of flirting, shopping, dining out and attending cultural events next week.

"
14 march 2019,sagittarius,"
If you feel the need to get things off your chest, speak up, for heaven’s sake! Verbal Mercury is in your house of inner contentment. Holding things in is a surefire way to be resentful and sad. Don’t let others walk all over you.

"
15 march 2019,sagittarius,"
With creative, optimistic Jupiter in your sign, you are full of bright ideas and the desire to have fun. That doesn’t mean, however, that other people share your joie de vivre. The heck with them! Go your own way.

"
16 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Don’t be surprised if you feel like a homebody these days. The Sun and Mercury are both cruising through your domestic sector, urging you to spend time relaxing at home with loved ones. Planetary energy is going to change next week, so recharge your batteries now.

"
17 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Pay closer attention to other people’s needs, archer. You are currently in an excellent cosmic position to create strong relationships with family members, a lover and business colleagues. The best part is that you will feel more content and at ease afterwards.

"
18 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Your ideas and opinions are valuable, Sagittarius. Even if other people can’t see the value in them, you should. With the Sun getting ready to enter your house of creativity and talent, these ideas can take flight.

"
19 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Try to get caught up on errands at home and projects at the office, Sagittarius. The Sun is getting ready to enter the most fun-loving part of your chart. Do you really want to be working late at work when you could be out having fun? I didn’t think so.

"
20 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Why do you feel so darn obligated?  The Sun moves into the most fun-loving part of your chart, but your mind seems to be on work and money and family matters. Let this other stuff go, archer, at least a little bit. You need some well deserved down time.

"
21 march 2019,sagittarius,"
The full moon could accelerate a team project in some way. This could be something that you’re working on with your family, friends or colleagues. It could also be a volunteer effort or something in the neighborhood. Watch out though–people could get pushy and want things done NOW. You may need to put them in a more realistic frame of mind.

"
22 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Like Leos, you’re not the type to let weaknesses show…or past hurts or current dramas. So if you need to go off into a corner today and lick your wounds, do so. Chiron, the Wounded Healer, is in an excellent position to help you move on.

"
23 march 2019,sagittarius,"
A battle may erupt between thinking practically versus being creative and fluid. Which side will win? The cosmic jury is out on that one. Give it time. The upcoming week has good aspects that will help you feel more at ease.

"
24 march 2019,sagittarius,"
This could be a sentimental day, a good time to remember the past….or to create brand new memories! With Venus getting ready to enter your warm and fuzzy domestic sector, your family and lover will become even more important to you.

"
25 march 2019,sagittarius,"
Who cares if it’s a Tuesday? The Moon is in your sign and it’s winking flirtatiously at the Sun in your house of romance, shopping and dining. It’s a good day to call out sick, but if you can’t do that, at least go out later and have some fun.

"
27 march 2019,sagittarius,"Spending more time at home is actually becoming appealing, archer. With so much planetary activity in your domestic sector, quality time with loved ones is a priority. And if that “loved one” is yourself, so be it!

"
31 march 2019,sagittarius,"The cosmos seems determined to find you romance and commitment, archer! Ten days ago, the Sun entered your house of amour. And today energetic Mars enters your house of serious relationships. The next 3 to 4 weeks are your best time in 2019 to lock in a major romantic chapter.

"
7 april 2019,sagittarius,"Sagittarius: The recent new moon fell in your house of wining and dining and shopping, but today has a more down home feel. If you need to recharge your batteries, then take a break from the party circuit and just chill out. Don’t worry, you’ll be ready to have some fun before the week is out.

"
8 april 2019,sagittarius,"Take a break if you need one, Sagittarius. With the moon in the most productive part of your chart you probably are pushing yourself way too hard. This week brings a lot of warm and fuzzy aspects that recommend cocooning at home. Pour yourself a glass of wine or cup of tea and read a good book.

"
9 april 2019,sagittarius,"Over the next few days, you could have some concerns about either a financial or romantic matter. A Sun-Saturn square could find you thinking with both your heart and your head. Let your head win this battle, my friend. Under current cosmic skies it’s better to be logical than emotional.

"
10 april 2019,sagittarius,"Big changes ahead….Jupiter goes retrograde today in your sign. Between now and August 11th you may do a lot of thinking about where you’re heading next in life. This is actually a good thing, as you may have been suffering from “shine object syndrome”–chasing after too many things. Give yourself time to sort things out.

"
11 april 2019,sagittarius,"There is a strong wave of nostalgia running through your chart right now, archer. You may be frequently thinking about the past, about people who may no longer be here. Honor their memory by taking out their photos and putting them in nice frames. Create a little shrine, a place where you can go every day to thank these people (and pets!) for being in your life.

"
12 april 2019,sagittarius,"People could get on your nerves today, especially if they’re whiny and feeling sorry for themselves. You don’t have the time and patience for this nonsense, so pull away if need be. Surround yourself instead with people who know how to enjoy life.

"
13 april 2019,sagittarius,"A battle is brewing in your mind: should you stick with the tried and true, or branch out into new things? Don’t try to resolve this today. A productive Sun-Jupiter aspect tomorrow will help you see things in a different light.

"
15 april 2019,sagittarius,"Don’t kid yourself about unsettling emotions, archer—they’re trying to tell you something. If something seems off, it most likely is. Don’t make any decisions just now, though; wait for the Sun to enter Taurus this Saturday.

"
16 april 2019,sagittarius,"Passive-aggressive behavior could be coming from people in your world; make sure that it doesn’t come from you! Jupiter is retrograde in your sign, which could make you a bit confused about things. But don’t resort to snarky verbal games. Leave that to the trolls.

"
17 april 2019,sagittarius,"Are you in the mood for love? I sure hope so, because vivacious Mercury glides into your house of romance today. Amorous Venus shows up on Saturday. But you won’t be walking around with stardust in your eyes. Despite the mushy energy, you’ll be own to Earth as the Sun will be in the most grounded part of your chart.

"
18 april 2019,sagittarius,"People who bring more chaos than happiness into your life need to go on a “watch list”! Seriously, watch their behavior. If something is off you may need to cut these ties. Tomorrow’s full moon is the time to do so.

"
19 april 2019,sagittarius,"Team efforts count for a lot these days, courtesy of the full moon in your house of friends and group activities. With the Sun entering your house of efficiency tomorrow, you are now in an excellent place to rally the troops.

"
20 april 2019,sagittarius,"Striking the right balance between business and pleasure is going to be your job over the next few weeks, archer. The Sun is now in the most efficient part of your chart, so it’s time to get caught up on old projects and errands and put them to rest. But it won’t be all work and no play: romantic Venus enters your house of flirting and love too! Rest up….you’re going to be busy.

"
21 april 2019,sagittarius,"Your sign is famous for taking risks but it seems that you’ve been playing it too safe lately. That needs to change, stat! With the passionate Moon in your sign it’s time to get a little creative with your self image and attitude. Just who do you want to be?

"
22 april 2019,sagittarius,"A sudden urge to get your act together could happen, so if it does, take note. The fiery Sun meets up with unpredictable Uranus in your house of habits and efficiency. From the way you handle projects to the office to the way you diet and exercise, everything could be revamped. Take the initiative with this, as your life could be dramatically changed for the better.

"
23 april 2019,sagittarius,"Yes! It’s always a good day when the passionate Moon meets up with abundant, optimistic Jupiter, And that’s what’s happening today…in your sign, no less. No one will bring you down or get in your way. Have fun!

"
24 april 2019,sagittarius,"Money talks, and it’s having a serious conversation with you right now. Probing Pluto goes retrograde in your house of income and savings. The next few months are superb for researching investments and new business opportunities (which includes a new job or even changing fields). Saturn is going to start spinning backwards here next week, so it’s critical to remain conservative when it comes to your finances.

"
25 april 2019,sagittarius,"Your relationship with money is going to change over the next few months.The way you earn, save and invest it are going to change. It won’t be an overnight process, but it is now under way. The bottom line is that you’re going to become a lot more conservative in your approach, and your ability to research new income sources will skyrocket.

"
26 april 2019,sagittarius,"Today is one of those days when you might end up kicking yourself. For what, you ask? Oh, things like forgetting to mail a bill, or putting gas in your car. Not staying on top of things at the office or at home. Being so busy that important details and dates are overlooked. Slow down, archer, and do things right.

"
27 april 2019,sagittarius,"No matter how much you want to see people get along and be happy, it just may not happen! Murky Neptune is stirring up weird emotions and behavior in others. Playing the role of peace maker could be a waste of time. This passes by Tuesday, so do your own thing for the next 72 hours.

"
28 april 2019,sagittarius,"It’s not your destiny in life to be broke and worrying about money all the time. What you need is better planning and a more secure source of income, something that you’ll be able to figure out over the next few months. Wealth is not something for “other people”; you can enjoy it too.

"
29 april 2019,sagittarius,"It’s time to become a lot more conservative with your finances, archer. Saturn goes retrograde in your house of income and savings. The upside to this is that you could uncover new sources of income that could dramatically increase your bottom line. Pluto happens to be retrograde here too, and considering that this is the planet of research, you’re in a good position.

"
30 april 2019,sagittarius,"No matter how badly you crave a firm foundation under your feet, you may have to wait a bit. Neptune and Mars are in a tiff, creating murkiness and aggression. It’s easy to lose your cool under this kind of cosmic energy. Remember, inner peace is one of the strongest foundations you could have.

"
1 may 2019,sagittarius,"Sexy and smart, all rolled into one package? Yeah, that sounds like you! With intelligent Mercury winking at lusty Mars today, you can impress just about everyone. Have fun.

"
2 may 2019,sagittarius,"Don’t expect people to be logical and calm. Heck, even you might be way too emotional today. A Mercury-Pluto square is the problem, but it disappears quickly. Tomorrow is a much better time when your feelings will be on an even keel.

"
3 may 2019,sagittarius,"Life is short, too short to waste all of your time on your worries and responsibilities. A happy Mercury-Jupiter trine tells you to enjoy yourself, nice timing considering that the weekend is here. So go ahead–flirt, party, dine out, take in a movie, enjoy sports. You’ve earned it.

"
4 may 2019,sagittarius,"It’s time to get with the program! If you been procrastinating on tasks or letting junk pile up in your car, home or office, it’s cleanup time. Tonight’s  new moon occurs in your house of efficiency and organization. Over the next few months you should be able to get caught up and even ahead. Trust me, you’ll feel less stressed and a lot happier as a result.

"
5 may 2019,sagittarius,"People could get pushy, and they may be hell bent on getting you to do what they want. Naturally this won’t sit well with the independent archer. Fortunately you are in a diplomatic, cooperative place. You can choose to work with these people, or just say the hell with it and walk away!

"
6 may 2019,sagittarius,"Shrewd, level headed Mercury is now in your house of getting things done, sooooo…..there’s no excuse! If you’re out of shape or have been plagued with health problems, guess what. There’s no excuse for that either. Do what you have to do.

"
7 may 2019,sagittarius,"Is it worth it to play by the rules? That’s the question posed by the cosmos today. You may not feel like it, but then again, it may be necessary. Your creativity and desire for living boldly is high; channel it the right way.

"
8 may 2019,sagittarius,"Doing things the same old way may feel comfortable, but it isn’t always smart….or productive. Uranus, planet of brilliant ideas, teams up with Mercury in your house of efficiency. You could hit upon a hack, routine or system that will free up time and reduce your stress level.

"
9 may 2019,sagittarius,"Chances are that you are going to totally ignore restrictions. Doing things the same old way just doesn’t cut it for you anymore. A sparkling Jupiter-Venus aspect will encourage you to take chances in all areas of your life, and this is a good thing!

"
10 may 2019,sagittarius,"Your head and your heart could be at odds today, and chances are logic will win out over emotions. But this may be necessary. Tough guys Pluto and Saturn are retrograde in your house of routines and stability, demanding that you remove any rose colored glasses that you’ve been sporting lately.

"
11 may 2019,sagittarius,"You’re famous for being one of the most free spirited signs of the zodiac, but today you’re ready to buckle down and get things done. This super-organized Martha Stewart kind of mood is going to last into next week, so rest up and dive into whatever it is that you need to accomplish.

"
12 may 2019,sagittarius,"Practicality meets adventure with a Moon-Venus trine. If you’ve wanted to try something new– a sport, hobby, lover (ahem), college course, travel destination–you’re in a great position to do so. Without doing anything stupid, I might add.

"
14 may 2019,sagittarius,"If relationships with people have been bumpy, you definitely need to make an effort to smooth things over. Hot headed Mars is spending its last day in your commitment sector, but tomorrow it moves on to a more emotional place, the eighth house. Money, sex, intimacy, communication–the lack if it, or its quality–will all be brought to the fore. Unless you enjoy living in a soap opera, try to get things under control.

"
15 may 2019,sagittarius,"Damn, you’re determined! Venus zips into your house of efficiency and red hot Mars blasts into the love, sex and money. You will be a force to be reckoned with, maybe too much of one. Don’t push too hard and alienate people you love and want on your side.

"
16 may 2019,sagittarius,"“You either need to lead, follow or get out of the way.” This old phrase is a bit harsh but it gets the point across. And this is the kind of mood that you’re going to be in over the next week. You’re more than ready to do your share; are other people willing as well? If not, tell them to get in line.

"
17 may 2019,sagittarius,"Jupiter, the planet of healing, is retrograde…in your house of healing! So in other words, you need to pay close attention to your body and the signals it’s sending out. Ignoring things isn’t going to make you feel better or enjoy a more fit physique. Start by making a few small changes to your routines and diet, and let them snowball into something positive.

"
18 may 2019,sagittarius,"If you feel as though you are completely DONE with something (or someone), there’s a good reason for that. It’s called the full moon in your house of closure, which happens tonight. This annual event lets you chuck what’s not working and move on. You might want to start with yourself, though: planets in your house of habits are recommending changes, the kind you know  need to be made.

"
19 may 2019,sagittarius,"You most definitely need to stick to a budget, Sagittarius. I don’t care how massive the blowout sale is, or the good deal you’re getting on something. With Pluto and Saturn both retrograde in your house of earning and saving cash, you need to be squirreling the green stuff away.

"
20 may 2019,sagittarius,"Your optimism rises as the Moon lines up perfectly with abundant Jupiter in Sagittarius. You’ll be in such a good state of mind that you won’t be bothered with distracting people and situations. If people try to butt in, politely tell them you’re busy….dreaming up your next adventure!

"
21 may 2019,sagittarius,"Yum! Cosmic energy starts to build in your commitment sector. The Sun and Mercury have just glided into your seventh house of serious love, beneficial for all of you, single or attached. Single archers could meet the love of their lives over the next month. Lines of communication open for those of you already involved in a relationship. Thinking about moving on to a better companion? That can happen too!

"
22 may 2019,sagittarius,"Take a page from the dwarf playbook (you know, Snow White and the Seven freakin’ Dwarves?): “whistle while you work.” Seriously, a terrific Uranus-Mars aspect enables you to put a smile on your face while you pursue even the most mundane tasks. Or as the Navy SEALs would say, “embrace the suck.”

"
23 may 2019,sagittarius,"It’s not your destiny in life to tolerate bad emotions, whether they come from you or somebody else. So if you’re the one with the problem, than you need to have a serious chat with yourself about why you’re feeling the way that you do. In your defense, aggressive Mars is currently in one of the most emo parts of your chart. This can stir the pot but it can also point out areas that you should address.

"
24 may 2019,sagittarius,"Easy does it, Sagittarius! A tense Venus-Moon square indicates that you need to watch your tongue (and what you put in writing too). The problem is that people around you may be slacking off, and you won’t take to it very kindly. Or they may be hitting you with guilt and poor-little-me routines. Walk away. Tomorrow is a much better time to set them straight diplomatically.

"
25 may 2019,sagittarius,"Jupiter is retrograde in your sign, sometimes making you wonder if your thinking is on target. The past few days have been confusing, to be sure. But a helpful Moon-Jupiter aspect brings clarity and the ability to express yourself well.

"
26 may 2019,sagittarius,"When the Sun is in your opposite sign, as it is now, it can bring out either conflict or cooperation. Today the Sun forms a good aspect with Chiron, asking you to examine your closest relationships. Is there too much drama and stress? And are you contributing to it? Be honest with yourself.

"
27 may 2019,sagittarius,"Your sign is famous for taking the longer view. But in reality, even archers go through times when they can’t see the forest for the trees. An illuminating lunar aspect helps you go up to the summit of the proverbial mountaintop and regain clarity. You’ll be out of the forest and up in the clouds.

"
28 may 2019,sagittarius,"You may experience a sense of discomfort today, as if you’re not sure if you’re heading in right direction. But it’s really due to Jupiter being retrograde in your sign. The gas giant is making you a lot more philosophical, forcing you to reconsider your assumptions and plans.

"
29 may 2019,sagittarius,"It’s your life and you need to live it your way, Sagittarius. This is true even if you’re in a serious romantic relationship, or you’re close to your family. Their expectations could get thrown in your face today. Try to be as diplomatic as possible and let them know that you make your own decisions.

"
30 may 2019,sagittarius,"Archers are famous for being the one of the most independent signs of the zodiac. You’re not big on listening to someone else’s advice. However, a Mercury-Jupiter opposition recommends that you pay attention to what a trusted mentor or advisor has to say. This could be someone you know in real life, or a sage who has written a book or taped a podcast. Don’t be too proud to admit that you need to learn more.

"
31 may 2019,sagittarius,"Sometimes love takes us to a place that’s full of rainbows and unicorns, where we put someone on a pedestal and we just can’t really see what’s going on. Then at other times we can see reality in the cold, grey light of dawn. But today a happy medium exists when you can be flirty and dreamy, yet down to Earth at the same time. It’s all about listening to your head AND your heart.

"
1 june 2019,sagittarius,"Better health, glowing skin and more energy can be yours if you’re willing to make a few small changes. A productive Venus-Jupiter aspect encourages you to simply change a habit here, a habit there. With serious Saturn and transformative Pluto in your house of ritual, you’ll be able to stick with it.

"
2 june 2019,sagittarius,"Old habits die hard, so they say. But you’re in a good position to create new habits and routines that will serve you well. With Jupiter retrograding through your sign you’re starting to realize what needs to change. You might want to start with your personal relationships, as a new moon occurs in that house tomorrow.

"
3 june 2019,sagittarius,"A productive new Moon helps you to create more balanced relationships in both your personal and professional lives. Don’t be afraid to talk about roles and responsibilities with other people. Otherwise you’re going to get stuck holding the bag, which will only result in resentment. This is especially true with family members: they need to do their share.

"
4 june 2019,sagittarius,"Recently red hot Mars has been tearing through your house of net worth, sex and intimacy. As a result you may have been tearing through cash, and there could’ve been plenty of drama in your love life. Fortunately, logical Mercury arrives on the scene today, tempering Mars’s aggression. Over the next three weeks you can gain a firmer handle on your emotions and money flow.

"
5 june 2019,sagittarius,"You’re known for keeping calm but that could be tough today. Aggressive Mars meets up with the passionate Moon in the most emotional part of your chart. Jealousy, obsession, anger, drama….yuk, all of these could get stirred up. Tomorrow is a complete change as people may actually want to be cooperative. Wait until then and don’t lose your cool.

"
6 june 2019,sagittarius,"Unless you want to deal with a lot of cranky people, make sure to play nice with others today. With magnetic Venus in the most cooperative part of your chart, you might discover that being diplomatic brings you unexpected rewards.

"
7 june 2019,sagittarius,"Your ability to see things through to the end is going to pay off, archer. High octane Uranus gives you the one final burst of energy that’s needed to finish something up. Other people may be in a bit of a shock that you’re able to do this, but hey–you’re the one with the bow and arrow and that killer bullseye shot.

"
11 june 2019,sagittarius,"If someone wants to give you advice you’d be wise to take it. Happy-go-lucky Jupiter is in your sign and it’s in a wonky mood, preventing you from seeing things clearly. Don’t be too proud to listen to what other people have to say. You’re not the only person on the planet with some brains.

"
12 june 2019,sagittarius,"With so much planetary activity in the most passionate part of your chart, you could easily be roused in some way, shape or form! Whether you are filled with joy or angry as all hell is up to you. You’re starting to realize that you don’t have to have certain emotions. This is called personal growth, and you’re ready for it.

"
13 june 2019,sagittarius,"Try to take a more balanced approach when it comes to handling people who are close to you. Forcing your opinions, habits and agendas on them will backfire. You may feel as though you know best (and you probably do!) but let others think that they’re making their own decisions.

"
14 june 2019,sagittarius,"Start becoming more serious about saving and investing money, archer. It may not be the topic that excites you the most. But you need to develop a stronger financial foundation. The peace of mind that you’ll experience will be worth it.

"
15 june 2019,sagittarius,"Your subconscious mind may be bubbling away like a heated cauldron, but that’s OK. It’s due to mental Mercury stirring things up. All sorts of memories and emotions could come to the surface—just let them go, like steam heading up to the clouds. You don’t need them anymore.

"
16 june 2019,sagittarius,"Tomorrow brings a full moon in your sign, and today it’s all about emotional healing. If there are things that you need to get out in the open, now is the time to do so. People need to hear what’s on your mind. Meditation, mindfulness and journaling are also recommended.

"
17 june 2019,sagittarius,"Yassss!!!!! The annual full moon in Sagittarius occurs tonight, and it spotlights your fondest wishes. Something that may have started around the time of your birthday could come to a conclusion. You may have to stick to your guns, though, as people try to get you to do things their way. That’s not their decision to make.

"
18 june 2019,sagittarius,"You want life to become more settled, with less drama. Fortunately a helpful Saturn-Neptune aspect allows you to do just that. Things won’t happen overnight but you have to start somewhere.

"
19 june 2019,sagittarius,"Your head and your heart could be at battle due to a Mars-Pluto face-off. Emotions might be rising really high, on your part and that of others. Don’t say or do anything that you might regret. If money is at stake you need to be extra vigilant.

"
20 june 2019,sagittarius,"Things could change quickly at the office today, so you need to be flexible. It’s also possible that your personal schedule has to be switched up without much notice. Leave yourself enough time to get errands done.

"
21 june 2019,sagittarius,"How comfortable do you feel in your own skin, archer? Two major planetary moves will help you reach a greater sense of contentment. The Sun enters your Cancer, your eighth house of deep feelings. Then Neptune begins to retrograde in your house of home and family, which deals with childhood programming and all of the other dramas that took place back then. It’s time to release mental junk.

"
23 june 2019,sagittarius,"With happy-go-lucky Jupiter in your sign, you’re open to just about anything. But other people in your world may not be on board, as they can’t see the benefits or the common sense in what you’re saying. The good news is that this is a temporary situation. By midweek you’ll be able to inspire them to think differently.

"
24 june 2019,sagittarius,"You can’t please everyone, Sagittarius, so don’t even try. People may use guilt or fear to try to get their way, but don’t fall into this trap. With Mercury about to enter the most adventurous, free-spirited part of your chart, you can’t afford to be tied down by other people’s expectations.

"
25 june 2019,sagittarius,"You may not be feeling like the life of the party today, but there is a reason for it. Chiron, the wounded healer, is making you question some of your choices in life. Don’t worry, this won’t last long. Tomorrow you’ll be back to your usual audacious self.

"
28 june 2019,sagittarius,"Somebody has to be the grownup today and it might as well be you. Seriously, you may have to take over and get things done as others won’t be able or willing to. But you’ll end up with greater peace of mind knowing that it was done right.

"
29 june 2019,sagittarius,"Taking a chill pill? With logical Mercury in the most visionary part of your chart, you’re able to see things for the way they really are. This will enable you to relax a bit instead of getting stressed out. Mental clarity is a beautiful thing!

"
30 june 2019,sagittarius,"People may try to clip your wings and chances are you’ll resent it! But there could be some value and common sense to what they’re saying. Don’t be too proud to consider someone else’s point of view.

"
1 july 2019,sagittarius,"You should be happier than a pig in mud! Lively, assertive Mars enters your house of taking chances and living bolder. Since you’re the most daring sign of the zodiac, this is a match made in the heavens. Make sure, though, that you don’t go broke in the process. This week’s solar eclipse occurs in your house of building net worth.

"
2 july 2019,sagittarius,"Creating a strong foundation in your life is the message from the cosmos, archer. This may mean playing by the rules….or perhaps breaking them! It’s up to you to determine which way to go. If breaking out of an old situation actually creates greater strength, then so be it.

"
3 july 2019,sagittarius,"It’s time to get serious about the long term, archer. You can no longer afford to wing it when it comes to your finances or love life. That’s the message behind today’s solar eclipse, an event that will have far reaching effects. Emotions and dramas need to be set aside so that you can get crystal clear about the path ahead.

"
4 july 2019,sagittarius,"Abundant Jupiter is in your sign and it’s suggesting some kind of fun family event in the near future. This could be a vacation, reunion or barbecue. And if hanging out with the family unit is not your idea of a good time, the Leo Moon recommends a get together with the tribe and your lover. So there.

"
6 july 2019,sagittarius,"Should you play by the rules…or break them, if just a teensy bit? That’s the question the cosmos asks you this weekend. Actually, you’ll be pondering this question over the next two weeks. Don’t surprised if your mind is going off in tangents, because you really do need to sort this out.

"
7 july 2019,sagittarius,"Big plans need to go back to the drawing board, archer. Mercury begins to retrograde in your high flying ninth house. This is where you can conceive ideas that are audacious, which is a beautiful thing—as long as they are well planned. This could be anything from graduate school to a world tour to forming your own startup. Slow your roll.

"
8 july 2019,sagittarius,"You could be suddenly motivated to take better care of your health, both physical and mental. This is worth spending money on by the way, as Venus (one of the planets that governs cash flow) is in a good angle. You may not need a celebrity physical trainer or a $5000 wellness retreat, but investing in yourself is important.

"
9 july 2019,sagittarius,"Flying all over the place emotionally just isn’t going to cut it, archer. A stern Sun-Saturn opposition demands that you operate with a calm, cool detachment. If you’ve been dealing with emotional issues to the point where they’re interfering with your happiness and ability to get through the day, then you need to either seek help or commit to doing a lot of inner work.

"
10 july 2019,sagittarius,"Your heart is bigger than the cosmos thanks to a glorious Sun-Neptune trine. So reach out to people who could use a bit of comfort and advice. While you’re at it, be sure to treat yourself well too. Your mind and soul could use some TLC.

"
11 july 2019,sagittarius,"Just when you thought you had everything under control….screwball Uranus throws a monkey wrench into the works. Unexpected delays and problems could crop up in just about any area of your life. Hothead Mars could prompt you to lose your cool. Don’t go there, because tomorrow the Moon glides into Sagittarius and you’ll be on firmer ground.

"
12 july 2019,sagittarius,"The Moon is in your sign and you are up for just about any kind of adventure. This is a great attitude to have, because Lady Luck (aka Jupiter) has your back. The events of this weekend could have some interesting ramifications in the months to come.

"
13 july 2019,sagittarius,"Oooh, yeah. The Moon is in Sagittarius and it meets up with happy-go-lucky Jupiter. Which means that the cosmos gives you its permission to do whatever the heck you feel like doing (as long as it’s legal). Enjoy!

"
14 july 2019,sagittarius,"Everyone likes feeling as though they are in control of their life. With power broker Pluto in your house of stability, chances are you’re experiencing this more intensely than the other signs. The problem is that you may become so agitated about it that you start making ultimatums or lose your temper. Chill out, as you might annoy someone whose help you need.

"
15 july 2019,sagittarius,"If your line of work isn’t making you the happiest camper on planet Earth, then it may be time for a change– a BIG one. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in your income sector could make you do a 180. So take some time today to consider what you’d like to do next, as the passionate Moon lines up perfectly with Saturn, planet of long term success, and Pluto, the planet of personal power.

"
16 july 2019,sagittarius,"Yasss!!! A lunar eclipse occurs in your cash sector, helping you core more dinero. You could get a new job or a raise. Maybe you’ll land a client with deep pockets, or come up with a winning idea for a business. One door closes and another opens—that’s how eclipses roll. Just don’t expect overnight wealth, an issue with this lunation. Slow and steady will win the race.

"
17 july 2019,sagittarius,"Risky business? Today’s Venus-Saturn opposition means that it’s not a good time to take ridiculous chances in any part of your life. On the flip side, demanding guarantees or answers from people won’t work either. Just go with the flow, because by tomorrow the cosmic energy shifts in your favor.

"
18 july 2019,sagittarius,"Aahhh. Your thoughts and emotions balance out, thanks to a peaceful Venus-Neptune trine. If you need to talk things over with someone close, do so. Otherwise just do some much needed inner work, like meditating or taking a walk in nature.

"
19 july 2019,sagittarius,"Your emotions may get stirred up as Mercury retrogrades into one of the most psychological parts of your chart. Love, sex and money (all hot topics) could be the focus. Issues that cropped up a few months ago could be back on the table, needing to be resolved. The retrograde period ends on the 31st, so use it to put things to rest.

"
20 july 2019,sagittarius,"Someone could be quite forceful, demanding answers or some kind of commitment from you. Or  you could be the one who is on the warpath. Take it easy there, archer. This approach could quickly backfire due to a Venus-Pluto opposition. Tomorrow is a much better day for communicating and compromising, so wait until then.

"
21 july 2019,sagittarius,"Phew. Logical thinking can be applied to emotional, romantic and financial matters. That’s because level headed Mercury meets up with the Sun, helping you cut out drama and feelings and deal with things head on. Mercury is retrograde, so issues from the past could return, but this is a good opportunity to lay them to rest.

"
22 july 2019,sagittarius,"Is it time to redecorate your place? If you read yesterday’s horoscope you know that now is an important time to create more contentment and serenity in your life. Why not start be treating a peaceful haven at home?

"
23 july 2019,sagittarius,"Things might be going so well that you’re getting a little suspicious. Chill out, archer—nothing bad is about to happen! It’s just that people are noticing your creativity and artistic talent. A lover (or a wannabe) is also impressed with your charismatic ways, so enjoy it already.

"
24 july 2019,sagittarius,"It’s better to err on the side of caution and tell it as it is today. Concealing information or tap dancing around issues could backfire. This is just as true in love and family issues as it is in business. The truth will set you free and everyone else, for that matter.

"
25 july 2019,sagittarius,"Don’t be surprised if you feel unstoppable! With lucky Jupiter active in your sign, and high octane Mars tearing through your house of adventure, you are  a force of nature. The only problem you may be dealing with right now is figuring out which audacious undertaking to pursue first. Things are only going to become more intense when Venus enters this part of your chart on Saturday!

"
26 july 2019,sagittarius,"Now that the Sun is in the most high flying part of your chart, you should be ready to take on some exciting new challenges. But a Mars-Saturn link warns that (a) some of these grand plans may cost money and (b) you can’t be going all over the place. Chasing after every “shiny object” is a surefire way to end up with nothing. So be selective and pursue     the one thing that matters most.

"
27 july 2019,sagittarius,"Life is too short to be romantically involved with someone who is a colossal bore. That’s the message from the cosmos as amorous Venus glides into your house of adventure! And if you’re in a relationship that has lost some of its spark, it’s time to reignite that flame. You have no excuses, babe: the sizzling Sun, lusty Mars and charismatic Venus are all in this house. Ggrrrr.

"
28 july 2019,sagittarius,"Your idea of what’s fun and interesting may be changing, archer. So don’t be surprised if you find that you’re getting bored with certain situations (and maybe even people!). The planets are urging you to live a bolder lifestyle and as a result you’re recognizing “limiting factors.”

"
29 july 2019,sagittarius,"“Playing by the rules? That’s for wimps!” If anyone displays this attitude today, head in the opposite direction. And if you’re the one who’s thinking this way, it’s time for an attitude adjustment. Hey, no one is telling you to hide in the shadows. On the contrary, the cosmos is pushing you to take some new chances. But you still have to do things sensibly as you push those boundaries.

"
31 july 2019,sagittarius,"“Aahhh. Not feeling so emo anymore.” If that’s the way you feel, here’s why: Mercury is now direct in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. Over the past few weeks you may have felt as though everyone was pushing your buttons. Maybe they were, maybe they weren’t; but perception is everything, as we know. Life becomes a lot more carefree tomorrow thanks to the Leo new moon.

"
1 august 2019,sagittarius,"What’s been on your bucket list for years, archer? It’s time to take action instead of putting these things off til “someday”. Someday is here now, in the form of a dazzling new moon in your house of personal growth. Over the next six months you can enjoy new experiences that will make your heart sing.

"
2 august 2019,sagittarius,"Something could happen today that will disrupt your plans or progress, and it could come out of the blue. Maybe it’s another person who stalls things. Maybe it’s your own lack of good planning, or questionable habits. Either way you need to face the facts and move on. This is not time to whimper and blame someone. Just deal with it.

"
3 august 2019,sagittarius,"A nice, cool sense of calm enters your heart and soul. The Moon in Virgo is bringing out your personal power, always a good thing to be in touch with. So brush your worries aside. You have what it takes to deal with them. For now, simply enjoy the weekend.

"

"
9 august 2019,sagittarius,"They say that in order to break the rules, first you must master them. Pay attention to that saying as it holds true for your sign right now. Learn how to do things the old-fashioned way. Play by the book. Listen to what older and wiser people have to say. Then prepare to do things your  way, once you’re ready.

"
10 august 2019,sagittarius,"Keep some of your more controversial ideas to yourself, archer. Not everyone is in the same kind of forward-thinking place that you are right now. I know, it’s a burden being a visionary but someone has to carry that weight. Others will catch up in time, only to realize that you were right.

"

"
13 august 2019,sagittarius,"Pay attention to the fine print, archer. A Moon-Mercury opposition indicates that there could be some confusion about details. It’s not that someone is try to deceive you. But you may be in too much of a hurry to be noticing things that you should. Slow down.

"

"
16 august 2019,sagittarius,"Nitpicking and foot dragging could arise, thanks to a Mercury-Uranus square. People may not be able to agree on a particular direction.

"
17 august 2019,sagittarius,"Stick with schedules and routines today, even if you’re chafing at the bit.

If your field or company leaves something to be desired, then consider other options before revving up the engines and moving ahead.

"
26 august 2019,sagittarius,"It’s high time that your closest relationships became more balanced. You’re an independent go-getter type, which is a good thing—until other people start expecting you to do everything all the time.

"
27 august 2019,sagittarius,"Logic rules as tough guy Pluto demands that you view things from both the short term and the long term perspective. If you try to operate with your emotions, game over. So if a little voice in your head is saying, “I don’t feel  like doing that” pay attention.

But you might be plagued with inner doubts, stuff that probably started back in childhood. Please. You’re a grown-ass man or woman, so tell your “inner child” to get over it!

"
31 august 2019,sagittarius,"You’re not feeling particularly sentimental these days, and that’s fine. Holding on to the past too much can prevent you from moving into a better future. So don’t feel guilty if people are trying to remind you of where you currently are. You’re developing momentum and if they can’t see that, it’s their problem!

"
1 september 2019,sagittarius,"People may be more willing than usual to pitch in and cooperate, so now’s the time to ask. This includes romance too.

"
15 march 2019,capricorn,"
So many people talked about writing down their goals, creating vision boards and manifesting their dreams. But right now you may have a hard time getting into that mental place. Is it because your practical nature doesn’t want to go along with stuff that’s “woo-woo”? Think again.

10 april 2019,capricorn,"Go within, Capricorn. There are riches in your subconscious mind that you haven’t begun to tap in to. Now that Jupiter is retrograde in the house of intuition and cosmic wisdom, you should pull away from the world a bit and discover hidden truths.

"
11 april 2019,capricorn,"Honey, you could charm the birds from the trees right now! A fabulous meeting between Venus and Neptune in your communications sector puts just the right words in your mouth. So go out there and dazzle everyone already!

"
12 april 2019,capricorn,"Keep a low profile today, Capricorn. Play dumb if you have to. Say little and reveal less. Has anyone entrusted a secret with you? Make sure you keep it confidential. A Jupiter-Mercury square warns that you could reveal too much intel otherwise.

"
13 april 2019,capricorn,"Inner contentment is desired by everyone, but it can be quite elusive. And in your case, it may feel like an impossible dream. Dig deep into your heart and psyche to find out what’s troubling you. You can  get past this if you try.

"
14 april 2019,capricorn,"Do as you please today….for once! Your tired brain needs a break from thinking all the time. The upside is that if you just chill out a little bit, that you will begin to transform. It’s time to morph from your cocoon.

"
15 april 2019,capricorn,"Your intuition may be a bit off today, so don’t rely on gut feelings. Nor should you listen to what others have to say! As the week progresses, things become more clear. The full moon on Friday is a winner for making key decisions.

"
16 april 2019,capricorn,"Hope you have your BS meter turned on. Put on the hip boots too. It could get pretty deep today as people are saying things that have no basis in reality. You can choose to get annoyed about this, or to ignore it and move on. Chances are you’ll ignore it. The upcoming full moon is in your house of ambition, and you’ve got bigger fish to fry.

"
17 april 2019,capricorn,"You are going to have to strike a balance over the next few weeks between your home and career lives. Even if you’re single and you don’t have to worry too much about other people, you definitely need some downtime for yourself. Life is too short to constantly be working and stressing out.

"
18 april 2019,capricorn,"From your chart it’s obvious that your values don’t mesh with those of other people…..which means that you could be in the wrong job, romance or friendships. Don’t get upset this; get real. Then find the people and situations that are right for you.

"
19 april 2019,capricorn,"You are entering an incredibly creative period, one which could transform your life for the better. Your home, hobbies, appearance and career can all be amped up. With tonight’s full moon in your house of goals and achievement, raising the bar isn’t just a nice thought…it’s imperative!

"
20 april 2019,capricorn,"Feeling all warm and fuzzy? Romantic, yet nostalgic? If you don’t, you will feel that way soon! The Sun just entered your house of flirting, date nights and romance. And Venus is now in your domestic sector of home and family. Your focus will switch from work-work-work to spending more relaxed quality time with the ones you love…and that includes you!

"
21 april 2019,capricorn,"Inner peace shouldn’t be something that you achieve “someday”. It’s a moment by moment thing. A wonderful Moon-Venus aspect helps you dig deep into a well of contentment and become more serene.

"
22 april 2019,capricorn,"Ready to shake things up in your image, love life and career? The cosmos has your back, Capricorn! A meeting between rebellious Uranus and the independent Sun encourages you to switch things up big time. It’s time to start living life with more juice and passion and fun.

"
23 april 2019,capricorn,"You could experience a mental or emotional release today, something that will soothe your soul. This is a good thing, because you’ve been wound up pretty tight lately. It’s a good time to pick up a healthy new mental practice, such as mindfulness or journaling.

"
24 april 2019,capricorn,"Here come the retrogrades! Pluto starts to spin backward today in Capricorn, encouraging you to dig deep into your psyche. Everything in your life is up for review over the next few months: love, career, health, friendships, travel plans, where you live, hobbies, you name it. Pluto loves doing research and is hell bent on getting to the bottom of things. As a result, your plans and ideas could go through profound changes.

"
25 april 2019,capricorn,"A vibey lunar aspect helps you feel so much more comfortable in your own skin, Capricorn. For months now you may have felt awkward or as though you’re not living an authentic life. That’s going to change, and it begins now. A greater sense of contentment and certainty is coming your way.

"
26 april 2019,capricorn,"Jealousy or childish behavior could erupt, and hopefully it’s not coming from you. Steer clear of known divas and whiners and keep your precious chi  in balance. With Pluto now retrograde in your sign, you’ve got bigger things to worry about: primarily you!

"
27 april 2019,capricorn,"Mars, the most motivated planet of them all, is stationed in your let’s-get-things done sector, the sixth house of efficiency. The red planet likes being here because hell, sh** has to happen! But as much as you may want to hustle, it appears that you need more details or a better plan. Slow down and take your time.

"
28 april 2019,capricorn,"Sometimes dealing with other people just seems like way too much, and today could be one of those times. There’s nothing wrong with carving out some quiet time for yourself. You have a busy few months ahead, Capricorn….it’s imperative that you recharge your batteries from time to time.

"
29 april 2019,capricorn,"A huge chapter in your life opens up today, Capricorn. It may not seem that way at first but when you look back later in the year, you will realize that late April was a game changer. That’s because Saturn, your ruler, retrogrades in your sign. Pluto started swimming backward here last week. In the months ahead you will change in ways that you can’t even conceive right now.

"
30 april 2019,capricorn,"“Why can’t everyone be as pulled together and efficient as I am?”  That may be your battle cry today as offbeat Neptune makes everyone around you slack off and make excuses. Well, you know what they say: when the going gets tough, the tough get going.

"
1 may 2019,capricorn,"One of the smartest things you can do this week is to get your home base all squared away. Said Carson Kressly (Queer Eye for the Straight Guy), “as long as my checkbook is balanced and my clothes are ironed I feel like I have some control over my life.” So clean up messes, get caught up on errands and live a less stressed life.

"
2 may 2019,capricorn,"For some odd reason you may feel a bit out of place. Chances are it’s old programming from childhood, and it needs to go. You’re an adult and what goes on in your mind is entirely your choice. Choose positivity.

"
3 may 2019,capricorn,"What a wonderful day for emotional healing! A cathartic Mercury-Jupiter trine allows you to be rational and clear sighted about what your issues are (and we all have some). Then you can find a way to handle them. Abundant Jupiter is in your house of psychology, so mindfulness and meditating are both good practices to start.

"
4 may 2019,capricorn,"Sweet! The new moon occurs in your house of love. This lunation sets the stage for meeting someone new or solidifying an existing romance. Your talent and creativity also happen to be in this sector, so be prepared to watch your skill set grow.

"
5 may 2019,capricorn,"Been burning the candle at both ends? It sure looks that way from your chart. You have to stop pushing yourself so hard, Capricorn. You also need to stop kidding yourself about nagging physical and emotional issues. It’s time for some extreme self care.

"
7 may 2019,capricorn,"Someone may try to use guilt or flattery to get their way with you. Fortunately, you’re not that stupid! And with mature Saturn in your sign, you’ll just let this go. This energy reappears on Thursday, so expect it to continue at least for a while.

"
8 may 2019,capricorn,"Sweet surprise! Unpredictability is Uranus’s domain, and today the blue planet forms a perfect line with lively Mercury. They meet in your house of fun and romance, a nice bonus. It’s a great day to do something spontaneous with your honey. Single sea goats could meet someone in a crazy way, which will be a story you can tell later on. Creative projects also get a huge boost.

"
10 may 2019,capricorn,"Metamorphic Pluto is retrograding through your sign, which is going to make you reflect upon how you’re living your life. From your chart it’s clear that old patterns have to go, especially old ones from childhood. So do sorrow, fear and regrets. Sayonara, baby.

"
11 may 2019,capricorn,"You’re becoming more disciplined lately (is that even possible for a Capricorn?) but ya still gotta have some fun. And a Sun-Saturn aspect is telling you to lighten up and book some play time. This energy runs all the way into next weekend, so stop being such a saint.

"
12 may 2019,capricorn,"You need to feel comfortable with what you’re doing and where you’re heading. If not, then take some time to reconsider your values and plans. With Pluto and Saturn both retrograde in your sign, there’s going to be a lot of reflection in the months ahead. Might as well start now.

"
13 may 2019,capricorn,"Metamorphic Pluto is suggesting that you make a few changes to your image, sea goat. This could be anything from your hair and wardrobe to your attitude and way of speaking. Don’t be afraid to sign up for classes that help you speak more confidently in front of groups, or the kind that polish up your manners. You’re going places are your image needs to reflect that.

"
14 may 2019,capricorn,"You can start to slow down and relax a bit, Capricorn. Aggressive Mars is getting ready to leave your house of productivity. No doubt you’ve been pushing hard; give it one more blast of energy. Then get ready for some fun in the weeks ahead.

"
15 may 2019,capricorn,"In the mood for love? I sure hope so! Even if you’re not, the cosmos will drag you kicking and screaming into a romantic place. That’s because (a) amorous Venus enters your house of love today and (b) red hot Mars enters the commitment zone. You’re the envy of the zodiac, Capricorn! This is one heck of a coincidence. This is also an excellent situation for simply having more fun and being creative.

"
16 may 2019,capricorn,"Crafting a message is always important. Whether you need to get through to your kids, a lover, colleagues or the world stage, you need to have a strong message. You need to be coming from a place of authority, but you can’t keep delivering the same old boring message either. Today is a smart time to figure out a better way to communicate.

"
17 may 2019,capricorn,"Not everything that you think and do should be out there for consumption. With Mercury in your house of living more creatively, you should be thinking about updating your self image and lifestyle. Just do it quietly. Pretend like you’re on one of those reality shows with the Big Reveal at the end!

"
18 may 2019,capricorn,"It’s time to be selective about who’s going to remain in your inner circle. The full moon in your house of friends and acquaintances demands that you surround yourself with only the very best kind of people. And unpredictable Uranus sparkles in your house of romance, indicating that something surprising and juicy could happen in love.

"
19 may 2019,capricorn,"As time goes on we start to act, dress and think in ways that other  people expect us to. And sometimes we get tired of our “persona”, desiring to change it. There is no magical way to do this; it won’t happen overnight. It’s a day by day process. With Pluto and Saturn shaking up your self-image sector, though, you can pull this off over the next few months. Patience.

"
20 may 2019,capricorn,"Sometimes you just have to go with what your gut is telling you and disregard logic. Today is one of those days, Capricorn. But keep your opinions and intuitive observations to yourself. Don’t let others know that you’ve got everything figured out!

"
21 may 2019,capricorn,"Nobody had better get in your way, Capricorn! With the determined Sun AND strategic Mercury entering your sixth house of efficiency, you are going to become a force of nature. It’s kind of like New Year’s Eve in May. You want to knock things off your list of things to do, things that will make your life a lot better.

"
22 may 2019,capricorn,"A terrific spurt of creativity and optimism hits you, and this will be contagious. Don’t be surprised to find that you’re attracting like minded people your way. Like moths to a flame they’re going to be pulled in by your can-do attitude. But hey, you always  had that can-do attitude. Finally other people are waking up to that reality.

"
23 may 2019,capricorn,"Playing by the rules isn’t looking so appetizing, Capricorn. People may try to hem you in but you won’t have any of it. They could also use guilt, which also won’t work. Yeah, you’re a rugged individualist. So what?

"
24 may 2019,capricorn,"Steer clear of people and pastimes that threaten to throw you off track, Capricorn. Yes, the weekend is here and you deserve to have fun. But you need to stay true to your values and your vision.

"
25 may 2019,capricorn,"You know what you need to do, so why aren’t you doing it? The smartest thing you can do today is to go within. Meditate. Journal. Be real and honest with yourself. Answers will come, and you’ll set out on the right path.

"
26 may 2019,capricorn,"From your chart it appears that you’re feeling guilty for no reason, Capricorn. You don’t owe anyone anything. This includes your job, a relationship or a team that you’re part of. The problem is that you are such a hard worker that you’re taking too much of the responsibility. Just do your own share and forget the rest.

"
27 may 2019,capricorn,"Other people may have been challenging you lately, and naturally this can be frustrating. This isn’t over; you could witness more of this nonsense on Wednesday. But you’re starting to realize that it’s not worth it to get engaged in their dramas. It’s not your karma to be someone else’s doormat.

"
28 may 2019,capricorn,"You may be waiting to hear news about something before you proceed. Or perhaps you’re waiting for certain events to occur. In the meantime, your subconscious mind will stir up all sorts of wonky thoughts! That’s because the moon squares Jupiter today. Face it: you don’t have all the facts and you’re just going to have to wait. For now, give your tired brain a rest.

"
29 may 2019,capricorn,"Your thoughts could be all jumbled up as your brain has way  too much going on inside. From your chart it appears that you’re trying to sort something out, and the right solution hasn’t presented itself yet. But like a dog with a bone, you won’t let go. Relax there, Fido. Inspiration and clarity start to return tomorrow.

"
30 may 2019,capricorn,"Don’t be afraid to “pull back the curtain” and see what lies behind it. Remember in The Wizard of Oz  when Dorothy is told “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain”? Honey, you DO need to find out what’s going on behind the scenes rather than ignoring it. Be discreet about it, but do it.

"
31 may 2019,capricorn,"The cosmos has just one demand of you this weekend, Capricorn: for heaven’s sakes, get out there and have some fun already! A sparkling Venus-Neptune trine suggests a short trip out of town, taking in a concert or brunching with the tribe. You need to cut loose and relax.

"
1 june 2019,capricorn,"There’s a side to you that many people don’t see. Maybe it’s because you’re not in touch with it enough! It’s a fun, frisky persona. Sultry even. Colorful and creative too. A Venus-Jupiter aspect helps you bring that side out you out, even just a little bit. But like a snowball running downhill, it develops momentum.

"
2 june 2019,capricorn,"Metamorphosis…..you’re going through it in a big way, whether you realize it or not. A terrific Venus-Pluto trine encourages you to become someone maybe not new, but more authentically “you”. Life is not a dress rehearsal. Don’t wait another day to let that side of you come out!

"
3 june 2019,capricorn,"First the good news: today’s new moon occurs in the most organized, efficient part of your chart. You’ll be able to cut through tasks like a hot knife through a cold stick of butter. The problem is, where to start? You may be so backed up at home and at the office that you don’t even know where to begin. Here’s a corny saying that might help: “By the yard, it’s hard, by the inch it’s a cinch.” Just pick one area and dig in, little by little.

"
4 june 2019,capricorn,"Relationships with other people should start to calm down now that levelheaded Mercury is in your house of partnering. Diplomacy and cooperation are going to count for a lot over the next month. You don’t always have to be in charge, even if you are the smartest person in the room!

"
5 june 2019,capricorn,"Things could get testy within a close personal or business relationship. Blabbermouth Mars is in an emotional mood and may not be thinking rationally. Be careful with what you say and do, as it appears from your chart that you will be working with people closely over the next few days. You’ll start feeling more cooperative when Venus changes signs on Saturday.

"
6 june 2019,capricorn,"You need to be around people who “get” you, Capricorn. With Venus in Taurus your charisma will be high, so it won’t be hard to find people who are drawn to you. Be selective and choose new friends, coworkers and lovers who aren’t afraid of the authentic you.

"
7 june 2019,capricorn,"This is no time to hide your talent from the world! Brilliant Uranus, the planet of genius, is active in your most creative sector. Be as assertive as you please. If you think that retaining the services of an expert will help you, go for it. I’m talking about a literary or booking agent, a manager, stylist or social media maven, for starters.

"
11 june 2019,capricorn,"It’s time to get real about health issues, whether they’re the physical or the mental kind. Abundant Jupiter is making you think that you can take on the world—with very little sleep, lots of stress and no valve for letting things go. News flash: you are NOT a bottomless pit of vitality. Like a bank account that’s depleted, it needs to be topped off

"
12 june 2019,capricorn,"You are under no obligation to do something that someone else is demanding. So don’t feel guilty about saying no. Let’s face it, you have enough on your plate already. You don’t need to do someone else’s job too.

"
13 june 2019,capricorn,"You’re so used to charging ahead on your own grit and determination that sometimes you forget that a higher power has your back. Don’t be too proud to ask for help from the spirit world from time to time; they’d be happy to oblige.

"
14 june 2019,capricorn,"You may not feel like cooperating, schmoozing or negotiating but (sigh) so you must. Face it, Capricorn, you can’t control everything, and that includes people. A little charm could go a long way for you right now.

"
15 june 2019,capricorn,"It seems like you’re being too hard on yourself. Why? You’re only human. From your chart it appears that you’re holding yourself up to some kind of perfectionist ideal. Relax a little bit. Be good to yourself.

"
16 june 2019,capricorn,"It’s time to buy the hatchet, Capricorn. Maybe you need to work things out with a family member, friend or lover. Perhaps it’s a co-worker who’s been driving you crazy. Heck, maybe you even need to let yourself off the hook! Life shouldn’t be a battle all the time.

"
17 june 2019,capricorn,"Your sixth sense will go through the roof, thanks to the full moon in the most mysterious part of your chart. Good thing too, as this is the house of closure and transition. If there is a part of your life where you’d like to hit the delete key, now’s the time. When it comes to other people, pay attention to the energy they’re giving off and not what they’re saying.

"
18 june 2019,capricorn,"There’s nothing wrong with being a little frivolous and light hearted. Nor is there anything wrong with chucking your responsibilities for awhile and just relaxing. Today is a good time for chilling out and letting other people hustle.

"
19 june 2019,capricorn,"You will be in one hell of a domineering mood, but is it wise to act that way? People will be more than willing to fight back, so choose your battles wisely. Cooperation returns on Friday when the Sun enters Cancer.

"
20 june 2019,capricorn,"You could do a complete 180 today, Capricorn! Maybe you’ll switch up your appearance. Or perhaps you’ll decide to enter a new line of work. Is your love life in the doldrums?  Then it’s time to add some juice to it. But don’t move too quickly. Make sure that stability is maintained in your life.

"
21 june 2019,capricorn,"You’ll need to play nice and cooperate over the next few weeks, Capricorn. The Sun is own your partnering sector, shining its light on relationships with people in your world—-and the new ones you haven’t met yet. But at the same time, confusing Neptune starts to spin backward in your house of thinking and speaking. What you say and how you say it will become critical. Take the time to consider your words carefully.

"
22 june 2019,capricorn,"Cut loose a little this weekend. The Moon is in the house of short distance travel, so if you can get out of town, go for it. If not, this sector governs partying too, and having adventures in your neighborhood. The only problem is which relaxing activities to choose!

"
23 june 2019,capricorn,"Venus is in the house of habits and routines, telling you to get your act together. But Jupiter opposes it, saying, “Why bother? Everything is OK just the way it is!”  Uh, no it isn’t. Pay attention to Venus and start making some changes.

"
24 june 2019,capricorn,"The need to be crystal clear is paramount today, Capricorn. If people don’t understand your meaning you will either (a) look foolish or (b) there will be problems down the road. This is just as true in your personal life as it is in your work environment. Keep things short and concise.

"
25 june 2019,capricorn,"Inner peace as as valuable as enjoying good health, and right now you need to chill out. Chiron, the wounded healer, is urging you to toss out emotional baggage that no longer suits you. Once Mercury enters one of the most psychological parts of your chart tomorrow, you’ll have the opportunity to do some much needed inner work.

"
26 june 2019,capricorn,"Just say “ohmmmm.” Mental Mercury enters Leo, your eighth house of emotional depth. The next few weeks are well aspected for getting your head on straight! Meditation, journaling, scheduling a psychic reading, talking to a therapist or close friend–do what it takes to feel better inside.

"
28 june 2019,capricorn,"You should be feeling more assertive and in control as your ruler, Saturn, is in an excellent angle. But the ringed planet is also winking at the Moon, which is in the most fun-loving part of your chart. It’s a great day for balancing the playful and more ambitious parts of your personality.

"
29 june 2019,capricorn,"Your emotions start to level off today, which is a good thing. For far too long you’ve been under stress, the kind that makes it hard to feel as though you’re in balance. Passion for life will start to return too, a wonderful gift from the cosmos.

"
30 june 2019,capricorn,"With Jupiter retrograding through the most psychological part of your chart, you may feel as though you don’t have to do any inner work. “I’m OK the way I am” could be your attitude. Uh….I don’t think so. There’s nothing wrong in admitting that you need to get your act together in the mental department, Capricorn.

"
1 july 2019,capricorn,"Your sign is considered to be one of the most traditional of the zodiac, but beneath that cool exterior lies a passionate heart and mind. Now’s a great time to release your inner rebel, even if just a bit! Red hot Mars enters your house of sex, intimacy, deep emotions and net worth. Start pursuing the things that make you happy.

"
2 july 2019,capricorn,"It’s not your karma to put up with a lot of flak from people who don’t honor who you are, Capricorn. If you are done  with being treated a certain (unpleasant) way….and from your chart it appears to be the case….then it’s time for some changes. And conveniently, tomorrow’s solar eclipse helps you do just that.

"
3 july 2019,capricorn,"There will be two eclipses in July, one in Capricorn and the other in Cancer. These will point out what you need to do to take care of your own needs, and what you will or will not accept from others. The solar eclipse today is in Cancer, and it will kick off a new period in which your relationships with others will change in a big way. Surround yourself only with people who support you; forget the rest.

"
4 july 2019,capricorn,"A recurring theme for you this month is this: just how much guff do you want to take from other people? Two eclipses in July (one was yesterday) will make you reconsider your interactions with others. A Saturn-North Node opposition today might make you feel as though you’re stuck dealing with certain people and their behavior. Nope. There’s nothing wrong with setting boundaries, Capricorn.

"
5 july 2019,capricorn,"You need to release feelings and ideas that have been building up inside, Capricorn. A helpful Jupiter-Neptune aspect recommends journaling, meditating or even therapy if you think you’d benefit from it. With a lunar eclipse arriving in your sign on the 16th, it’s time to close out anything that’s not working for you.

"
6 july 2019,capricorn,"Don’t feel guilty if you feel like cutting loose and doing things that are more fun and adventurous. From your chart it’s clear that you need a break, so take one. And if this means cutting loose from people who are downers, so be it. You don’t need to end your relationships with them; just avoid them this weekend!

"
7 july 2019,capricorn,"Your emotional state is the focus now that Mercury is retrograding through one of the most psychological parts of your chart. People have been riling you up lately, and you may have been losing your usual cool. How you deal with others is a big focus for the rest of the week. On the 16th there will be a lunar eclipse in your sign, at which time you’ll be making some big decisions about who stays and who goes.

"
8 july 2019,capricorn,"Right now you’re not willing to settle for second best, and why should you? On the contrary, with spunky Uranus having fun in the most creative part of your chart, you’ll be dreaming up ways to make your life more colorful. Find people who have a zest for good living and join their ranks!

"
9 july 2019,capricorn,"You know what you want and how to get it….so why are other people hellbent on you doing things their way? This is a theme that is going to crop up again between now and the time of the lunar eclipse in Capricorn on the 16th. It could turn into a full blown battle, if you let it. But is that worth your time and trouble?

"
10 july 2019,capricorn,"You could charm the birds from the trees as inspired Neptune helps put just the right words in your mouth. You tend to tell it like it is but right now you should use a little sugar. This isn’t bullish**ing; it’s smart strategy!

"
11 july 2019,capricorn,"Rebellious feelings may crop up, the kind that tell you to chuck it all and start over doing something else, something more enjoyable and creative. It’s not necessary to dump things or people though. Chances are you simply need more down time and to make your personal life more interesting.

"
12 july 2019,capricorn,"Not everyone needs to know your private business, so keep a few things to yourself. The Moon is in the most secretive, mysterious part of your chart, so don’t be surprised if you feel like an agent provocateur.

"
13 july 2019,capricorn,"You’ll do your best work alone this weekend, although this doesn’t mean that you have to hide! It’s just that your intuition is sharp and you’re better off listening to your own counsel rather than that of other people. Besides, you know your life better than anyone else.

"
14 july 2019,capricorn,"A powerful lunar eclipse is getting ready to occur in your sign, and you should already be feeling it. Disciplined Saturn and subterranean Pluto are both retrograde in Capricorn, making you question the truly important things that matter the most. If anyone tries to tell you what to do, or how you should think, chances are their head will be handed back to them on a plate—by you!

"
15 july 2019,capricorn,"You’re as serious as a heart attack, sea goat. With the Moon forming a perfect line with Pluto and Saturn, you mean business. You know what you want and damn skippy, you’re going to get it. Tomorrow is show time: the lunar eclipse is in your sign.

"
16 july 2019,capricorn,"Yeah, baby! Out with the old and in with the new. No, it’s not New Year’s Eve—it’s a freakin’ lunar eclipse in Capricorn! Anything or anyone that is past its sell-by date can be unceremoniously tossed to the curb. Seriously, this is probably the best time in 2019 to let go of the past and embrace a sparkling new future. You’ve worked for it, and you deserve it.

"
17 july 2019,capricorn,"Yesterday’s lunar eclipse in your sign has brought a much needed sense of finality. You are more than ready to close out old chapters of your life and start new ones. Healing Jupiter is hard at work in the subconscious mind sector, helping you to release negative emotions. You need to be as baggage free as possible.

"
18 july 2019,capricorn,"You are at your charming best, so don’t be surprised if people are drawn to you like moths to a flame! It’s also a grand day for romance as the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, are winking at each other across the heavens. Enjoy yourself–it’s way overdue.

"
19 july 2019,capricorn,"The recent lunar eclipse occurred in Capricorn, highlighting your  needs and plans. Nothing wrong with that! And today Mercury retrogrades back into your house of cooperating with others. Therefore it’s time to reflect upon your closest connections and think about whether they’re helping or hurting you. If someone is taking more than they give, it’s time for a decision to be made.

"
20 july 2019,capricorn,"A recurring theme in your chart this month has been: who’s on Team Capricorn? You’re better off flying solo than having people around who are going to hold you back. But a terrific Sun-Mercury aspect today helps you communicate and develop stronger bonds with people you love and trust. Build that inner circle.

"
21 july 2019,capricorn,"Finding people who think and feel the same way you do is possible thanks to some positive planetary energy. The Sun and Mercury meet up in your house of partnering, a good thing indeed. The recent eclipses have pointed out relationships that aren’t the best for you (in all areas of your life). Now its time to forge some happy, productive alliances.

"
22 july 2019,capricorn,"From your chart it’s clear that you are WAY overdue for a mental rest. You’re also in need of some good lovin’! Well, the Sun is now in Leo, your house of sex and intimacy. Deep emotions are found here, and not just the romantic kind. Clear your mind and your heart of negativity and make a vow to be good to yourself over the next four weeks. Avoid divas and trolls, and surround yourself with only the very best kind of people.

"
23 july 2019,capricorn,"Honesty is the best policy, especially when you are quietly pondering your own life. So keep it real as you make decisions and move ahead. Over the next four weeks you can really dig into your psyche and do some important inner work. The peace of mind you’ll have will be worth the effort.

"
24 july 2019,capricorn,"Your head and your heart are working together quite nicely, rather than battling it out! This is a good thing as you have a lot on your plate. The next week will be a thoughtful one. Meditating or journaling are good ways to get to the bottom of things.

"
25 july 2019,capricorn,"Your libido and magnetism reach scorching  levels due to a lusty Mars-Jupiter trine! Seriously, if I could bottle and sell what you’ve got going on right now I could erase the national debt. So don’t be surprised if people are checking you out and making, uh, offers. Of course, you could decide to make them sweat and disappear into a cloud of mystery.

"
26 july 2019,capricorn,"Stern Saturn in your sign is telling you to chill out. Yes, you–the most stable sign of the zodiac! The issue is that aggressive Mars is super active in one of the most emotional, psychological parts of your chart. While this can help you resolve stuff from the past that may be holding you back, it could also make you way too emo. When gentle Venus enters this sector tomorrow you’ll feel more relaxed.

"
27 july 2019,capricorn,"You have a LOT going on in houses that deal with your closest connections and the emotions that get stirred up by them! Mercury is retrograde in the commitment sector, and the Sun and Mars are busy in the house of sex and intimacy. As a result your head and your heart may be going all over the place. Fortunately gentle Venus sashays into Leo today, helping you tiptoe through this emotional minefield with grace.

"
28 july 2019,capricorn,"“It’s never too late to have a wonderful childhood.” I love that saying, because it’s a reminder that we, as adults, can treat ourselves well! We can be playful and curious. We can give ourselves the love and attention that maybe we didn’t get growing up. This is the message that the cosmos has for you today, Capricorn. It’s time for some extreme self care.

"
29 july 2019,capricorn,"This could be a dramatic day as erratic Uranus is bringing out the diva side of people–hopefully not you! If anyone tries to push your buttons the best bet is to walk away. This is true in the weeks ahead too. There is a lot of cosmic activity trying to bring your own emotions into balance; you don’t need to be thrown off by anyone else’s nonsense.

"
30 july 2019,capricorn,"Finding new ways to express yourself becomes a lot easier thanks to a helpful Mars-Neptune aspect. This is about how you think, speak and write. Maybe you need to become less forceful and more eloquent. Or perhaps you need to stop being a weenie and speak up for yourself. A few small changes can go a long way.

"
31 july 2019,capricorn,"Relationships with others should start to smooth out now that Mercury is direct in the most diplomatic part of your chart. Thank heavens, because your chart is loaded with planets in emotional places. Not everyone will remain chill, but that’s no problem. Overall things are improving, which will have a positive effect on your state of mind.

"
1 august 2019,capricorn,"The Leo new moon opens up a new phase in which your emotional state will calm down. Thus will be, in part, due to better financial opportunities coming your way, along with a more chilled out romance. But you’ll also be interested in doing some inner work, the kind that revolutionizes the way you think and feel.

"
2 august 2019,capricorn,"Touchy, touchy! People could be more prickly than a cactus plant. That includes you, if you let them push your buttons. But with gentle Venus trying to heal your subconscious mind right now, you could choose to stay away from malcontents and divas. That’s right…..it’s a choice.

"
3 august 2019,capricorn,"From your chart it appears that you could use a bit of adventure, so go out this weekend and find one! Take a quick trip out of town. Try a new sport or hobby, something unlike anything you’ve done before…which means that it pushes you out of your comfort zone. Plan a vacation to an exotic locale. Join a meet-up group where you’ll be in the company of people who think differently. It’s all about expanding your mind.

"
4 august 2019,capricorn,"You’re in an interesting place, Capricorn. This week’s planetary energy allows you to step into a place of greater confidence and self awareness. It starts today as the two most powerful planets in the solar system, Mars and Pluto, hold a meeting in your house of identity. Inner changes will begin.

"
5 august 2019,capricorn,"Being blunt is your usual MO, and hey…it works for you! People know what to expect from you, which is the unvarnished truth and logic. But a lunar aspect recommends being a bit softer and even more nebulous in your communications today. Don’t BS anyone, but don’t put it all out there either.

"
6 august 2019,capricorn,"You’re in a highly creative place high now, but you run the risk of taking on too much. In typical Capricorn fashion you’ll tell yourself that somehow you’ll get it all done. Yes, but at what cost to your personal happiness? Be selective and choose the most important project or two.

"
7 august 2019,capricorn,"You’ve got more going on behind the scenes than a CIA agent. Seriously, you’re going within and mining pure gold. Quietly, without fanfare, you’re coming up with amazing ideas and solutions to problems. You’re healing old emotional wounds and feeling better about yourself and the future. Like a proverbial phoenix, you will rise from the ashes.

"
8 august 2019,capricorn,"Cosmic activity in the most secluded part of your chart indicates that you should spend more time with your thoughts. When it comes to other people, only let in a trusted few, the kind who support you wholeheartedly. This includes a lover, by the way. Your bond should be deep and unshakeable. If it isn’t, something needs to give.

"
9 august 2019,capricorn,"Your ability to master your thoughts and emotions is increasing, Capricorn. As a result you’re becoming calmer and more at ease. Two major aspects arriving this Sunday will help you feel even better about yourself and your prospects. It’s nothing but clear sailing ahead.

"
10 august 2019,capricorn,"You tend to be blunt, which is just fine in your opinion. After all, why waste time and words on fluff and idle chitchat? But from your chart it appears that you should be a bit more elusive today. Keep ’em guessing! You don’t have to lie, but you don’t have to be as direct as usual.

"
11 august 2019,capricorn,"Emotional upheavals and drama get dialed WAY down thanks to three glorious aspects occurring today. First, Jupiter resumes direct motion in the house of the subconscious mind. You should feel more optimistic than you have in a long time. Then intelligent, logical Mercury zips into the house of emotions. And erratic Uranus goes retrograde in the house of romance and drama, which will actually smooth things over. Namaste!

"
12 august 2019,capricorn,"You’re putting yourself first these days, and that’s a good thing. There has been a lot of emotional turmoil in your life lately, and chances are you’ve been too proud to show it. Set higher standards for the way you choose to live and how you expect to be treated. No big proclamations are necessary; just look out for #1.

"
13 august 2019,capricorn,"Take the long view when it comes to your career and finances, Capricorn. You may have to take two steps back in order to move five steps ahead. The upcoming full moon on the 15th is all about earning more, so be prepared to explore new options.

"
14 august 2019,capricorn,"Get in touch with your sweet, sexy side! A luscious Sun-Venus aspect is just the ticket for intimacy. If you are single and looking, tomorrow’s full moon could soon bring in a more mature, stable (but not boring) type. Pay close attention to the last week of August: it is loaded with good aspects for amour.

"
15 august 2019,capricorn,"One door closes, another opens? That’s the message behind today’s full moon in your house of creating more financial and emotional stability in your life. A new job or promotion may come to pass, something that puts a lot more money in your bank account. A fresh chapter in love can begin, along with feeling better about yourself on a psychological level. This may mean releasing parts of the past but who needs the old crummy stuff, anyway?

"
16 august 2019,capricorn,"Everyone thinks that you are as balanced and disciplined as a Zen monk. But you know the reality: you have moments (even days!) when you feel shaken up and emotions are going all over the place. Try to stay in Zen mode today, which may require counting to ten and taking a lot of deep breaths. Erratic Uranus is making people and situations volatile. Remain chill, grasshopper.

"
17 august 2019,capricorn,"If you have HAD IT with someone’s attitude or actions, it could really catch up with you today. Maybe it’s a lover or co-worker. Maybe it’s the world at large. No problem, however. In 48 hours Mars enters the most optimistic, free-wheeling part of your chart. You’ll be so busy planning your next audacious adventure that you won’t have time to think about anyone else.

"
18 august 2019,capricorn,"Everyone thinks that you’re so buttoned up and traditional. That you’re afraid to embrace new ideas and change. Man oh man, are they in for a wakeup call. You’re entering into one of the most visionary phases of your entire life, starting today. Mars enters your optimistic ninth house of thinking big and bold, to be followed by Venus and the Sun later this week. The next four weeks are going to be intense as you repeatedly break old rules and replace them with new ones. Image update, anyone?

"
19 august 2019,capricorn,"Projects that you’re working on have excellent long term potential, so keep at them. You may be tired of slogging away but things are about to change for the better. Once the Sun enters Virgo later this week, momentum will build nicely, all the way through September.

"
20 august 2019,capricorn,"Emotions could be raw today as the turbulent Moon is in a tough angle. But is there any real substance behind your feelings? Chances are you’re just tired and overworked. By tomorrow you’re back in charge, so let this temporary cosmic storm pass.

"
21 august 2019,capricorn,"One of the most adventurous periods of your life is beginning as Venus joins Mars in the most daring part of your chart. Do you need to climb Mt. Everest?  No. Disappear into the sunset with a dashing foreign secret agent? No (although that does sound delightful). This may simply be about changing small things. It could be about doing a 180 too. It’s entirely up to you.

"
22 august 2019,capricorn,"Wouldn’t it be nice if everyone on planet Earth was just as direct and logical as you? Hell yeah, but that’s not the way life works, something that will become apparent today. Foggy Neptune is going to confuse their words and meanings. You can choose to get annoyed or let this pass. By tomorrow you’ll be thinking about so many exciting options that you’ll forget all about this.

"
23 august 2019,capricorn,"“Life is a daring adventure or it is nothing at all” said Helen Keller. This statement may sound like it fits a Sagittarius rather than you, but stereotypes are meant to be broken! Capricorn, you are now in the biggest rut-busting periods I’ve seen in your chart in years. The Sun is in your house of taking risks, joining Mars and Venus. Between now and September 14th you can accomplish things (or at least get them started) that you never dreamed possible.

"
24 august 2019,capricorn,"Anyone who thinks that a Capricorn is the “traditional” type when it comes to love is dead wrong. You’ll have the chance to prove that today as lusty Mars winks at gorgeous Venus. These orbs meet in your house of adventure and thinking differently. A surprisingly sexy side of you is revealed!

"
25 august 2019,capricorn,"A little voice inside your head may be telling you to not take some kind of a gamble. But where does that voice come from? Is it really yours, or is it your parents’ ? Maybe it stems from society and your need to fit in. Get ready to squash that little voice, Capricorn. This week brings eye-opening aspects that will completely change your point of view.

"
26 august 2019,capricorn,"A series of ground breaking Uranus aspects starts today and continues all week, and they are designed to help you bust out of an old groove! This can truly be one of the one most liberating periods you’ve experienced in a while. Today you should be thinking about how to bring more pizzazz into your love life. No lover in sight? That could change in a heartbeat as unexpected meetings could occur.

"
27 august 2019,capricorn,"It’s time to put away the Boss Man or Boss Lady persona, at least for today. We all know that you’ve got everything figured out, but we lesser mortals don’t need to be reminded of that fact. Besides, the cosmos its calling for you to start partying more and try on a new, creative image. What are you waiting for?

"
28 august 2019,capricorn,"Things are starting to come together, much to your pleasure (and possible disbelief). But you’ve been busting your hump and it’s now time for some much needed R & R. With planets active in your houses of travel, fun, romance and shopping, start eating yourself well. Extreme self care is what it’s all about.

"
29 august 2019,capricorn,"The next two to three weeks will be some of the most amazing you’ve had in a long while, Capricorn. Today lively Mercury glides into your house of taking chances and living bolder, a theme that has been building all week. Don’t be surprised if you feel restless or edgy as a result. You’re starting to realize that there’s a great big world out there, and you want a nice chunk of it for yourself!

"
30 august 2019,capricorn,"Sayonara. Auf Wiedersehen. Ciao, baby. Buh-bye. That’s your new mantra as a scintillating new moon occurs in your house of living bigger and bolder. So say farewell to people, situations and your own personal attitudes that have been holding you back. There will be people who say that you’re not going to be successful, but what the hell do they know? Not much, something that will become apparent pretty soon.

"
31 august 2019,capricorn,"You definitely need some down time, sea goat. The recent new moon occurred in your house of long distance travel, but if you don’t have the cash or the time for a long vacay, then book a weekend trip. Anywhere. As long as you have the opportunity to unwind that’s all that matters. Then book another one, OK?

"
1 september 2019,capricorn,"Go with the flow and stop worrying about what you “should be doing.” Vivacious Venus tells you to lighten up and enjoy life. Unpredictable Uranus is having some fun in your romance and creativity sector. Is it such a bad idea to start scheduling fun times in your calendar?

"
2 september 2019,capricorn,"The word “impossible” simply isn’t in your vocabulary these days! With high octane Mars meeting up with the fiery Sun in the most visionary part of your chart, you will have no shortage of amazing ideas brewing in your mind. This energy isn’t just happening today, by the way. It keeps right on going into the middle of the month, so run with it.

"
3 september 2019,capricorn,"Quit doubting yourself, Capricorn! Everyone thinks you’re so focused and confident, but you know that’s not always the case. Right now (usually) optimistic Jupiter is in a funk, making you wonder if you’re on the right track. One of the issues at hand is that you have a number of options to choose from in life, and you’re getting stuck. Over the next two weeks you’ll narrow things down and the path will become clear.

"
4 september 2019,capricorn,"Circumstances in your life are changing, subtly and slowly. Maybe you’re not even aware that this is going on. It’s a  positive situation, so don’t be too anxious to make decisions or change course. Give things time to gel.

"
5 september 2019,capricorn,"You’re never satisfied with what you’ve accomplished, always looking for the next challenge. While this might wear out less hardy souls, it’s all in a day’s work for your sign. The good news is that some exciting new options are coming your way. Chances are that your imagination is already dreaming stuff up. Once Saturn goes direct in your sign on the 18th, you’ll have the confidence to dive in.

"
6 september 2019,capricorn,"A little voice may be telling you that you’ve overlooked something, but that’s probably not the case. Right now there is a lot of cosmic activity encouraging you to think in big, bold brushstrokes. You’re not used to thinking in a daring way, and that little voice is having a fit. Ignore it and keep on being a visionary!

"
1 january 2019,aquarius,"One of the biggest keys to enjoying 2019 is going to be the people in your world. You won’t be going it alone, that’s for sure. Be open to meeting new people, such as movers and shakers in the business world. Or people who share your charitable spirit, who want to do volunteer work. Hang out with your friends more and make new ones. These folks could introduce you to even more people, which will make your life so much richer.

"
2 january 2019,aquarius,"All around the world people are setting goals and thinking big. Lucky for you, the Moon is in your house of ambition. It trines Chiron, the wounded healer. The question raised is this: are you setting your sights too low? Is a negative self image hampering your ability to progress and enjoy life? Let this sh** go, honey.

"
3 january 2019,aquarius,"If you are a frequent visitor to My Stars!, you know that yesterday the cosmos asked you to do some inner work. To get rid of negative self-image issues. Well, today this becomes real. A Sun-Saturn aspect makes you Dump. The. Mental. Junk for good. It’s over.  Good riddance.

"
4 january 2019,aquarius,"Right now you’re the vibiest sign of the zodiac, thanks to planets starting to pile up in the house of the subconscious mind. Things get even more intense as shrewd Mercury glides here today. You’re more psychic than John Edward, so don’t be afraid to use your intuition!

"
6 january 2019,aquarius,"A solar eclipse occurs, illuminating the darker corners of your psyche. It occurs in your house of the subconscious mind, and it has a lot of healing energy associated with it. Uranus goes direct also in your house of communicating. It will become so much easier to get your point across to people.

"
7 january 2019,aquarius,"Your ability to make new friends and enjoy the company of old buddies increases quite nicely. Venus is now in your house of camaraderie, urging you to get out of the house and network. You can do this for professional purposes too.

"
8 january 2019,aquarius,"What you think and what you say need to be two different things today! A harsh Mercury-Mars square could prompt you to spill the beans. If in doubt, keep things to yourself. Friday is a powerful day for learning some interesting secrets.

"
9 january 2019,aquarius,"Charming the birds from the trees is quite possible today, so get ready to dazzle! Something unexpected could arise from it, something beneficial. But you won’t fins out unless you GET out there and show the world what you’ve got.

"
10 january 2019,aquarius,"You need to separate emotions from hard facts when it comes to money, Aquarius. That could be tough because murky Neptune is swirling its mist. This energy carries into next week, so keep it real.

"
11 january 2019,aquarius,"It’s time, Aquarius. Time to release the negativity and the sorrows. The bad dramas and the bad dreams, not to mention the not so helpful habits you may have acquired. That’s because Pluto, the planet of death and transformation, is working its magic in your house of the mind. Welcome the change.

"
12 january 2019,aquarius,"You’re in a social, lively mood thanks to the Moon and Mars in one of the chattiest parts of your chart. But you could be a bit TOO talkative, so watch what comes out of your mouth.

"
13 january 2019,aquarius,"Pay closer attention to your own intuition rather than what others are telling you. Your mind is operating like a radio tower this week, so don’t ignore valuable intel that comes in from the ether.

"
14 january 2019,aquarius,"One of the most important things that you can do for yourself right now is to create solid personal rituals. From your chart it appears that you could use a little bit more structure. It may not sound glamorous, but you’ll end up feeling more serene!

"
15 january 2019,aquarius,"You can do terrific work behind closed doors this week. As a matter of fact, the cosmos encourages you to keep things hush-hush. Your Facebook friends don’t need to know everything that you’re up to. Pull yourself away from the crowd and consider your options.

"
16 january 2019,aquarius,"You’re in a good position to put old dramas to rest. Who need some anyway? Not you. With the Sun entering your sign this coming Sunday, you should be traveling with as little baggage as possible.

"
17 january 2019,aquarius,"
People could be throwing shade today, despite how friendly and diplomatic you may be. Let this pass. Tomorrow is a much better day for enjoying their company.

"
18 january 2019,aquarius,"
You’re like a walking radio tower, psychic as all getout. Let those gems from the ether flow into your brain. But for heaven’s sake, don’t repeat them. You’ll regret it.

"
19 january 2019,aquarius,"
Some unexpected news could come your way that will throw you off balance—but not for long. The Moon just entered your house of stability and the fiery Sun will soon be in your sign. Let it go and get ready to celebrate your birthday season.

"
20 january 2019,aquarius,"
Happy birthday! The Sun is now in your sign, crowning you the celestial favorite. It’s important that you follow your own heart and mind over the next year. With Venus squaring Neptune today, it could be easy to be swayed by what others want for you–and from you. 

"
21 january 2019,aquarius,"
Your birthday season is underway and a Leo lunar eclipse helps you ring it in! Leo is your seventh house of serious relationships, both personal and professional. There could be some major news arriving, But don’t act on it too quickly. You need to gather more intel. Wait until Mercury enters your sign on Thursday.

"
22 january 2019,aquarius,"
Need help or advice? Looking for love? Maybe you just want to be around people who know how to live life to the fullest. If that’s the case, today’s Venus-Jupiter conjunction is perfect for being around people who fill you up. This is not a day to stay at home; get out there and mingle.

"
23 january 2019,aquarius,"
This is Mercury’s last day in your house of the subconscious mind, and truth be told, you could feel a bit frazzled. Your thoughts and emotions will be all over the place. Fortunately this ends tomorrow, so don’t make any major decisions until then.

"
24 january 2019,aquarius,"
Phew. Intelligent Mercury glides into your sign today, joining the Sun. Your emotions will calm down and things will become clearer. This is a great time to update your image.

"
25 january 2019,aquarius,"
This could be one of the best days in 2019 to team up with like minded people. Join a charitable effort. Look up meet-up groups with people who love the hobbies you do. Find movers and shakers in your industry. And don’t forget BFFs; we can all use a few more!

"
26 january 2019,aquarius,"
What you want to say and what you should say are two different things. Megamouth Mars is in your house of communicating, but it opposes the Moon. Which means that you run the risk of shooting off your mouth and saying the wrong thing. Keep a lid on it.

"
27 january 2019,aquarius,"
People could be critical today, but you shouldn’t care. With the Sun in your sign you know deep inside what’s right and what’s wrong. Let others troll and be little people.

"
29 january 2019,aquarius,"
You mean business, and anyone who can’t see that is in for a big surprise! With the independent Sun forming a perfect angle with sharp-as-a-tack Mercury, you have the planning skills of a five-star general. 

"
30 january 2019,aquarius,"
Someone you know–a friend, colleague or person from the neighborhood–could prove to be a valuable connection. If someone has advice or wants to help you in any way, consider it seriously. 

"
31 january 2019,aquarius,"
There’s nothing wrong with admitting that you could use a little help. This includes the kind that soothes your soul and brings you into greater emotional balance. Don’t try to go it all alone.

"
1 february 2019,aquarius,"
Loose lips sink ships! Keep confidential information on the down low, Aquarius. Hidden detractors and dream stealers are lurking around. Don’t say (or text) anything that you’ll regret.

"
2 february 2019,aquarius,"
It’s a great weekend for some impromptu adventures with your friends. If a lover suggests a quick trip out of town, say yes! A very social period opens up from now through the 14th; enjoy it.

"
3 february 2019,aquarius,"
Tomorrow’s new Moon occurs in your sign, putting your dreams front and center. Why not do a little daydreaming in advance? Venus glides into your house of intuition and the subconscious mind today. Spend sometime thinking about what you would like to manifest in the year ahead.

"
4 february 2019,aquarius,"
Woo-hoo!! Today’s new Moon occurs in your sign, and it’s your annual opportunity to start manifesting your dreams. Lucky Jupiter is in an excellent position from your house of friends, colleagues and mentors. Don’t be shy about relying on other people as you go through the remainder of the year.

"
5 february 2019,aquarius,"
Yesterday’s new moon occurred in your sign, stirring up all sorts of ideas of fun things you’d like to pursue over the next year. So many ideas….so little time! Fortunately shrewd Mercury will help you narrow down your options today.

"
6 february 2019,aquarius,"
Do the things that you don’t feel like doing today. Yup, stop procrastinating. Dig in and get it over and done with. Tomorrow has a much more playful vibe!

"
7 february 2019,aquarius,"
Your generosity of spirit is legendary. Keep it comin’, as a wonderful Sun-Jupiter aspect indicates that others will be dazzled by your willingness to go the distance with others. You have so much to offer….why keep it all to yourself?

"
9 february 2019,aquarius,"
A surprising piece of news could reach your ears today, something that will put a smile on your face. Process it. This energy crops up again next Wednesday, so be ready for the next scoop.

"
15 february 2019,aquarius,"
No one is going to be able to confuse you this weekend, Aquarius. You are far too practical and level-headed. So let them prattle on about their nonsense, smile and say little. What they also don’t know is that your intuition is razor sharp too!

"
2 march 2019,aquarius,"
Now that Venus is in your sign, it’s all about you! A helpful aspect with Chiron lets you know that you no longer have to hide in the shadows. Don’t play second fiddle to anyone or anything.

"
10 march 2019,aquarius,"
Your motivation rises to locate more money and put it in the bank. Creative, inspirational Neptune is active today, helping you brainstorm fresh ideas. This energy goes on all week, so take it and run with it.

"
11 march 2019,aquarius,"
It’s time to lighten up your load, Aquarius. Planets are active in your house of emotional and physical healing. Be ruthless. Cut out the people and activities that are superfluous. This may sound cold, it is necessary for your peace of mind.

"
12 march 2019,aquarius,"
Follow your own wisdom today, Aquarius. You’re a friendly sign and you like it when everyone gets along. But people could be hard to please, so why bother? Give them all the space they need.

"
13 march 2019,aquarius,"
Need to get rid of any (bad) habits? Maybe you just need to create smarter routines so that your life will be saner. Work on this over the next few days. The Sun is getting ready to enter one of the more social parts of your chart: pull things together now. 

"
14 march 2019,aquarius,"
You’re going to be in a logical, level-headed mood, thanks to a Sun-Mercury connection. Use this energy to straighten out areas of your life that need to be fixed. People in your world may put up resistance, but too bad!

"
15 march 2019,aquarius,"
Don’t try to get others to agree with your vision or your plans. They will only put up resistance, regardless as to how brilliant you may be! Wait until the full moon in Libra on the 21st to gain cooperation.

"
16 march 2019,aquarius,"
The weekend ahead is perfect for resting up and pampering, Aquarius. It’s a smart time to create some healthy new rituals, such as meditating or going out for walks in nature. Your body and mind need to unwind.

"
17 march 2019,aquarius,"
You need to mellow out a bit, Aquarius. With aggressive Mars in action, you may feel like bringing up old issues with people and getting in their faces. But a subtler approach is much better. Once the Sun changes signs on Wednesday, you’ll be able to speak your mind in a different way.

"
18 march 2019,aquarius,"
Try to be diplomatic today, Aquarius. Just a little. The moon is in your house of partnering. You’ll get further if you consider the needs and opinions of others rather than just focusing on yourself.

20 march 2019,aquarius,"
You’re in one sweet spot, Aquarius. Charismatic Venus is in your sign, placing all eyes on you. Now everyone is going to want to know what’s on your mind because the Sun enters Aries, your thinking and communicating sector. Just make sure to keep a little mystery about you!

"
21 march 2019,aquarius,"
Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t so something, or that it’s impossible. The full moon occurs in your house of taking chances, but a tense Venus-Mars aspect could bring out the naysayers. There could also be old crap from your childhood that starts to get in the way. Kick it to the curb and charge ahead!

"
22 march 2019,aquarius,"
Words can hurt, as we all know. So if anyone has been critical, today is a good time to process it and let it go. This is especially true of people who may have said things to you years ago, things that might still be ringing in your ears. Meditation and journaling could be a big help. 

"
23 march 2019,aquarius,"
You could be feeling mighty moody today, Aquarius. The Moon is gliding through the most intuitive and emotional part of your chart. But this has a purpose, as the energy could make you aware of parts of your psyche that need to be cleansed and “updated”.

"
24 march 2019,aquarius,"
Don’t be surprised if you have money on your mind–shrewd Mercury meets up with creative Neptune in your income sector. The next month is awesome for scoring more dinero, but this is the kind you earn. (Forget winning the lottery.) A week from today red hot Mars enters your talent sector, so sell those skills of yours.

"
25 march 2019,aquarius,"
Your confidence rises and you’re not afraid to put yourself out there. This is overdue! Not everyone will agree with your ideas or image, but that doesn’t matter. Being true to yourself is what counts.

"
27 march 2019,aquarius,"The weekend is approaching and it’s time to slow down a bit. You may come to the realization that relaxing at home quietly may be a better move than going out on the town. Besides, a family member may need some support right now–be there for them.

"
31 march 2019,aquarius,"I hope you’re well rested! Right now you are looking like the numero uno social butterfly of the zodiac. First of all, the Sun entered your house of schmoozing and networking ten days ago. And today red hot Mars enters your house of romance, fun, shopping and dining. It’s a tough job but somebody’s got to do it.

"
7 april 2019,aquarius,"You have a sense that things are going on behind the scenes, and chances are you’re right! This is about money and career, not love. And maybe it’s YOU who wants to get something done on the down low without people knowing. If that’s the case, more power to you, my friend.

"
8 april 2019,aquarius,"With the moon in your house of home and family, it’s important to build bridges with people. From your chart, it appears that either you or they are being quite stubborn, something that you will realize on Wednesday. But today is well aspected for getting across to people in a common sense manner. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

"
9 april 2019,aquarius,"What you’re thinking and what you reveal should be two different things, both today and on Saturday. A harsh Saturn aspect warns against revealing too much. This is true in your personal life as well as your business one. Not everyone around you has your best interests at heart. Play it safe.

"
10 april 2019,aquarius,"The company you keep is going to become more important to you in the months ahead. Jupiter is now spinning backwards in your house of networking and friends. Are you surrounded by people who make your heart sign? If not it’s time to do some soul searching.

"
11 april 2019,aquarius,"Ready to get inspired? Creative Neptune is active in your money sector, helping you consider new ways to pull in more cash. Pay close attention to gut hunches and dreams that you have over the next week. They could be more on point than you may realize.

"
12 april 2019,aquarius,"Don’t be swayed by what others have to say. They may have your best interests at heart but only you can make decisions about where you’re headed. Let people know, in a diplomatic way, that you appreciate their input….but you’re going to do things your way!

"
13 april 2019,aquarius,"What you feel like saying and what you should say are two different things. A Sun-Pluto square warns against revealing too much. Also, this is NOT a good for faking it or getting pushy. Give others the respect they deserve.

"
14 april 2019,aquarius,"If you need to get something off your chest, then find a trusted confidante. A wonderful Sun-Jupiter aspect is perfect for opening up. Your own intuition is sharp too, so don’t be afraid to use it.

"
15 april 2019,aquarius,"You’re a team player, it’s true. But today people may be ornery and unwilling to cooperate; or maybe it’s you who’s a tad cranky! Just do your own thing. By midweek everyone will be in a more diplomatic place.

"
16 april 2019,aquarius,"Keep your wallet locked up and don’t sign any loan documents! Some murky planetary energy affects your finances over the next 24 hours. Emotions could run high and facts will be hard to get. Wait until Mercury changes signs tomorrow.

"
17 april 2019,aquarius,"Get ready to schmooze….Mercury, the planet of communication, enters your house of talking! And thinking, writing and all other forms os self expression, like art. You’re entering into a wonderful time period in which you can dazzle people with your ideas and delivery. Socializing looks good too.

"
18 april 2019,aquarius,"There’s a certain amount of energy that a caterpillar needs to burst out of its cocoon and become a magnificent butterfly. Right now you are ready  for the metamorphosis, but it seems to be taking a lot out of you. That’s OK. Today may be a bit draining, but tomorrow your energy returns.

"
19 april 2019,aquarius,"If you’ve been considering making a bold move of some kind, it’s time to get off the fence. Tonight’s full moon occurs in your house of taking risks. Quit waffling and get on with it already. You’ll be surprised at how relieved you will feel.

"
20 april 2019,aquarius,"The next four weeks can be quite heartfelt now that the Sun is in your house of family members and inner contentment. In a nice coincidence, gentle Venus glides into your house of self expression, enabling you to speak your mind. It’s a time for getting closer to loved ones and feeling better in your own skin.

"
21 april 2019,aquarius,"If you’re not sure which direction to head in, then by all means talk to trusted friends or mentors. Likewise, seek out talking heads online who have been down your path before. Listen to podcasts or audio books. Someone out there has words of wisdom for you.

"
22 april 2019,aquarius,"Sudden changes could happen with a housing or family matter, due to unpredictable Uranus stirring things up in your domestic sector. Sit tight because things may take a few weeks to unfold. Say little and observe a lot. Your intuition will guide you.

"
23 april 2019,aquarius,"They say that people make the world go round, and in your case this happens to be true. A friend or acquaintance could prove to be unusually lucky for you in the near future. It’s also a smart time to expand your contact list, so reach out to new people and get to know them better.

"
24 april 2019,aquarius,"May the healing begin! Probing Pluto starts to retrograde in your house of psychological and physical health, opening up an intense period that will last for several months. It isn’t always easy to face your bad habits and ailments, but so it is. Do this important work now and reap the benefits before 2019 comes to a close.

"
25 april 2019,aquarius,"Right now you’re so psychic that it’s scary. What can I say? Use the sixth sense to your advantage, my friend! It’s not everyday that we are so blessed. Go ahead and do some digging.

"
26 april 2019,aquarius,"The Moon in Aquarius could make you a bit territorial, ready to defend yourself from anyone who wants to mess around with your peace of mind. Which means that you may need to count to ten, breathe deeply and ignore certain malcontents.

"
27 april 2019,aquarius,"They say that the best things in life are free, something to consider. An intense Mars-Jupiter aspect could make you crave designer clothes, Italian sports cars, $15 martinis and swag galore. Keep your money locked up and search out the simpler, cheaper goodies that are out there.

"
28 april 2019,aquarius,"There is no gene that codes for discipline. Nor is there DNA that makes someone more efficient than someone else. So get that king or ridiculous thinking out of your head. Discipline is a skill that can be learned, and you need to develop yours. Get on with it.

"
29 april 2019,aquarius,"Are you ready for some serious spiritual cleansing and healing? That is what is going to happen over the next few months. Today Saturn goes retrograde in the deepest, most mysterious part of your chart, the twelfth house. It’s time to take better care of your psyche.

"
30 april 2019,aquarius,"The right side of your brain will be warring with the left today. It’s a grudge match between the logical left and the vibey right. Obviously this is not a smart time to make any major decisions. Emotions will run high and you could be feeling more defensive than usual. Wait a few days.

"
1 may 2019,aquarius,"Your charisma is through the roof thanks to assertive Mars in your house of talent, fun and romance. Whatever you do, don’t hide this from the world! Today is super well aspected for dazzling others, both in your personal and professional lives.

"
2 may 2019,aquarius,"The passive-aggressive types are on the prowl, so watch out for the silent but snarky types. It’s also a smart idea to say little about job hunts, business trade secrets, or anything else that you want to keep confidential. Loose lips will sink your ship.

"
3 may 2019,aquarius,"Just in time for the weekend: a fabulous Mercury-Jupiter trine in your house of friends and networking. Basically the cosmos is giving you the permission to party like it’s 1999 to quote Prince…or 2019 for that matter. Besides, you could meet some exciting new people.

"
4 may 2019,aquarius,"Home is where the heart is, and today’s new Moon is in your domestic sector! So don’t be surprised if you’re feeling all mushy and nostalgic. You could also feel like nesting, moving in with a lover or starting your own family. Single people, don’t give up hope…this lunation could bring in a lover before November.

"
5 may 2019,aquarius,"Mars is in a pushy mood today, so make sure that you’re not acting too aggressively. This is especially true with a lover and friends. They’re not the same as you, with the exact same values and ideas. You need to accept that. But if the differences are too great, then you may need to question the relationship.

"
6 may 2019,aquarius,"As Dorothy said in the Wizard of Oz,”there’s no place like home!” Mercury glides into your domestic sector, encouraging to you to open up the lines of communication with family members. The next few weeks are also perfect for feathering the nest. Thinking about moving? You could find an ideal place, as early as tomorrow.

"
7 may 2019,aquarius,"Loose lips sink ships! Keep things to yourself today. Stern Saturn is active in your house of secrecy, demanding that you reveal nothing. This includes your feelings as well as your opinions. Sometimes you just have to play the game this way.

"
8 may 2019,aquarius,"Something could happen that will put a smile on your face and bring some peace to your heart, Aquarius. A lovely Mercury-Uranus conjunction occurs in your house of home, family and contentment. Perhaps you find your dream home. Or a family drama is put to rest. Maybe you move in with your lover or conceive a baby. It’s also possible that you simply feel more at peace with the world.

"
9 may 2019,aquarius,"Where’s the party? Who the hell cares that it’s Thursday? A lively Venus-Jupiter trine sets the stage for cocktails, dinners out and partying with the tribe. Sure, you could use this energy for furthering your career. Find an industry get together or seminar. But whatever you do, make sure that you’re out of the house and mingling.

"
10 may 2019,aquarius,"Ready to enter where angels fear to tread? I hope not! If your gut is telling you NOT to do something, pay attention. Blithely charging forward and hoping for the best is a surefire way to end up making a mistake. Wait a few days before taking action and making decisions, if you can.

"
11 may 2019,aquarius,"A calming Sun-Saturn trine enables you to clear away negative emotions and feelings that you’re not good enough. You are  good enough, dammit, something that the cosmos is trying to drive home! This powerful cathartic energy continues all the way through next week. Leave the past behind with all of its drama and crummy memories.

"
12 may 2019,aquarius,"The Leo moon puts your relationships in sharp focus. Just how open are the lines of communication? How much respect are others showing you, and vice versa? The rest of the week is awesome for getting back on track with people, especially on Monday and Tuesday.

"
13 may 2019,aquarius,"We all need help from time to time when it comes to straightening out our psyches. Maybe it’s the assistance of a therapist, maybe it’s just talking to a trusted friend. Don’t be shy about seeking out wisdom, which could also come from a book or podcast. Every day this week has positive aspects for mental and emotional healing.

"
14 may 2019,aquarius,"Yum! The cosmic lovers, Venus and Mars, wink at each other across the heavenly skies. It’s a great date night, not to mention a super day for singles to meet someone new. Go go ahead and flirt, have cocktails or dinner, plan a weekend getaway or take in a movie. Anything could happen under this aspect.

"
15 may 2019,aquarius,"Life takes a more practical turn due to two planets changing signs: Mars and Venus. Home and family issues get attention from gentle Venus, the peacemaker who also loves beauty (hmm…is it time to redecorate?). Mars moves into the most efficient part of your chart, pushing you to clean up your act both at home and the office. Diet and fitness routines could also take off nicely.

"
16 may 2019,aquarius,"Need to draw a line in the sand? Then do it today, calmly and without anger. Logical Mercury and mature Saturn are woking hand in hand to help you set boundaries with other people. While you’re at it, take a good long look at yourself: what limits do you need to set on YOU? For example, maybe you need to stop working such long hours at the office and pamper yourself instead.

"
17 may 2019,aquarius,"You may need to balance your own private time with the demands placed on you by friends and family. Today is a good time to think about how you’re going to pull this off. Otherwise everyone will be in a snit and you won’t be at peace.

"
18 may 2019,aquarius,"Something could happen that will make you feel a lot happier and content, Aquarius. Tonight’s full moon takes place in your house of ambition and success, a helpful aspect. But two other terrific aspects take place, these in your domestic sector. Love, family, housing: all of these could be positively affected. Things could move quickly too, so be ready.

"
19 may 2019,aquarius,"Old habits die hard, something that may ht home today! You may feel as though you will NEVER be able to change. Nonsense! Here’s a good read for you: The Power of Habit  by Charles Duhigg. (I have no affiliation with this book, but I listened to it on Audible and it’s awesome).

"
20 may 2019,aquarius,"You won’t be in the mood for needy people today, but that’s OK. With a Moon-Jupiter conjunction in your house of friends you’ll be able to pick and choose who you want around. From your chart it appears that you need to surround yourself with people who are more optimistic.

"
21 may 2019,aquarius,"It looks like you are going to be bitten by the love bug! Not only does the feisty Sun roll into your house of romance today, so does lively Mercury. Over the next four weeks romance will be on your mind in a big way. Since this house also rules creativity, your skills should be out there for everyone to appreciate.

"
22 may 2019,aquarius,"Terrific health is one hell of a valuable asset, on that we all can agree. And today a fabulous Uranus-Mars aspect helps you uncover ways to improve yours. Even if there isn’t a single ache or pain in your body, chances are that you could become more toned and vibrant. It’s all about feeling good in your own skin, baby.

"
23 may 2019,aquarius,"Oohhh, watch what you say today, Aquarius. People will be touchy and take offense easily. Don’t try to force relationships. Slow and steady will win the day.

"
24 may 2019,aquarius,"With the Moon in your sign, you should be feeling feistier than usual. So if anyone tries to convince you to do things the same old boring way, chances are you’re going to revolt. Do you really need people trying to hold you back? The truth is they may mean well, but it’s your life and you have to live it.

"
25 may 2019,aquarius,"The moon is in Aquarius and all eyes are on you! They should be, anyway, so get the hell out of the house and make heads turn. With lucky Jupiter in your friendship zone, you should be connecting with old friends and meeting some interesting new ones in the process.

"
26 may 2019,aquarius,"You need to lighten up, Aquarius! According to your chart, you are overdue for some playtime. It’s Memorial Day weekend in the US, so you maybe off for a few days. But you need to keep the fun momentum going well into June.

"
27 may 2019,aquarius,"People may have been uncooperative lately, and you could be getting fed up. But a positive lunar aspect recommends that you change your approach with them. Their skulls maybe as thick as a brick wall, so you may need to promise them some kind of reward or benefit for playing nice.

"
28 may 2019,aquarius,"Someone may try to pull you off track today, Aquarius. The problem is that you need to stick to habits and routines and to get your job done. It’s also possible that you may decide to slack off! Stick with the program. Discipline has its own rewards, which you’ll discover soon.

"
29 may 2019,aquarius,"You may not feel like playing by the rules today, but that’s not wise. Even if you’re a creative genius, or the most talented person in the office. You might feel like bending all sorts of rules but a Mercury-Neptune square warns against it. Don’t worry, this aspect doesn’t last long!

"
30 may 2019,aquarius,"“To thine own self be true.” Those are wise words, Aquarius. With the Sun and expressive Mercury in the most creative part of your chart, you need to be your authentic self, not someone else’s version. That could be difficult due to a Mercury-Jupiter opposition. Trying to blend in with your friends or society is not  the way to go.

"
31 may 2019,aquarius,"Your independent side could go on the back burner as a nurturing Venus-Neptune aspect pushes you to get closer to others. It’s quite a warm and fuzzy vibe, excellent for love and family matters too.

"
1 june 2019,aquarius,"Reexamine your assumptions, Aquarius. You may think that you have the lowdown on everything and everyone but you don’t. Start paying attention to the details and the big picture will follow.

"
2 june 2019,aquarius,"Releasing old dramas and negativity becomes so much easier thanks to a cathartic Venus-Pluto trine. Somehow living in the past and being pissed off a lot of the time just isn’t working for you, and this is a good thing. It’s called progress. It’s going to continue in the weeks ahead too.

"
3 june 2019,aquarius,"The new moon occurs in your house of romance, and it has a nice balanced feeling to it. A Pluto-Venus aspect demands a drama-free relationship, one in which you feel as though your needs are being met. Singles, you could meet someone new between now and the end of the year. Just avoid entering into a relationship because your friends all seem to be moving on with their lives. Make the right decision.

"
4 june 2019,aquarius,"The pace may pick up at the office or at home, now that lively Mercury is in your house of getting things done. The funny thing is you may actually want to blast through old projects and get caught up. This is smart, because there is so much positive energy going on in your house of fun and romance that you need to free up play time!

"
5 june 2019,aquarius,"Ever have one of those days when you just can’t handle the mess on your desk or in your car? Or the stuff that comes falling out of the closet when you open the door? Or the e-mail account with 785 old messages in it that need to be trashed? Yup, it’s that kind of a day. So buckle down and get to work. As they say in the movies, “alright men, I’m going in.”

"
6 june 2019,aquarius,"Lend a hand to people who need it. With the Moon in the most cooperative part of your chart, you can make a difference in someone’s life with even the smallest gesture. And the best part? Your kindness will come back to you.

"
7 june 2019,aquarius,"Emotions could start spilling out of you, much to your surprise (and the people around you!). But this is a good thing. If you want people to be more cooperative you need to let them know what’s on your mind. They’re not mind readers, you know.

"
11 june 2019,aquarius,"Petty disagreements and jealousy could spill over today, and it could come from any direction. Unless you want to be in the middle of it, remove yourself from snarling people. If you can’t, then keep calm and carry on without engaging. Cooperation returns on Friday and over the weekend. 

"
12 june 2019,aquarius,"You’ve been operating on all eight cylinders lately, and no doubt you’re a little tired. The cosmos recommends that you slow down today and take better care of yourself. You’re not a bottomless well of energy. Chill.

"
13 june 2019,aquarius,"Inspiration is a well that sometimes seems to dry up. But today you’ll be able to drill down and access more skill and taint than you ever expected. Over the next week you should do whatever it takes to bring your gifts to the world. If that means taking a class or working with a mentor, so be it.

"
14 june 2019,aquarius,"Trust your gut today, Aquarius….it will guide you better than logic and the opinions of others. The great thing about a finely tuned sixth sense is that it can actually help you make more rational decisions. Nothing “woo-woo” about it.

"
15 june 2019,aquarius,"You need more cooperation from the people around you. Over the next week you may realize that you’ve been taking on way too much responsibility. But trying to force others to be team players isn’t going to work. Maybe you need to find yourself a new team?

"
16 june 2019,aquarius,"Stick to the facts and keep emotions and gut feelings out of things. Planets are lining up nicely in the most logical part of your chart, helping you see situations for what they really are. Keep this in mind midweek when things could get murky.

"
17 june 2019,aquarius,"A full moon in your house of friends, colleagues and networking could bring a team project to a finale. But people may not be willing to play by the rules. Egos could get out of line. This energy could run through most of the week, by the way. Once the Sun enters cancer on Friday you’ll be more at ease.

"
18 june 2019,aquarius,"Today’s aspects call for structure, plenty of it. You can’t afford to fly by the seat of your pants, no sirree. Old habits die hard and your mind may fight new changes. But consider how better off you’ll be if you change them.

"
19 june 2019,aquarius,"Team efforts might go off the rails due to a Mars-Pluto smackdown. Cooperation will be hard to come by, so don’t expect it. The passive-aggressive types will be up to their usual petty nonsense too. Ignore it and move on.

"
20 june 2019,aquarius,"A domestic or romantic situation could take a quick turn, and it may throw you off balance. Don’t get crazed! The Sun moves into one of the most practical parts of your chart tomorrow and sanity will return.

"
21 june 2019,aquarius,"Summer is here (north of the equator anyway) and your mind may just be on chilling out and relaxing. But the Sun enters your house of efficiency, telling you to put down the beer and chips and start getting organized. In an interesting twist, Neptune starts to spin backward in your house of earning more. Time is money. The bottom line is that the more efficient and caught up you become, the more cash you’ll make.

"
22 june 2019,aquarius,"Starting some kind of mental management practice could pay off big time, Aquarius. Mindfulness, meditating, journaling, affirmations—choose something that works for your personality and schedule. From your chart it appears that you need more stability in your life, and this is a good place to start.

"
23 june 2019,aquarius,"Trying to get everyone to agree and play nice today could be a thankless task. Seems like everyone thinks that their way is the best. They may also have different dreams and values, which may be something that won’t change. Try not to be too rigid if that’s the case.

"
24 june 2019,aquarius,"Bad habits, lack of routines, unclear expectations—all of these could come back to haunt you if you’re not careful. You may not feel like sticking to a regimen or creating better habits but in the end you’ll learn that discipline equals freedom.

"
25 june 2019,aquarius,"Words can hurt or they can heal, something to remember today. So if anyone has been throwing shade your way, remember that it says more about them than it does about you. And be thoughtful when you communicate with others.

"
26 june 2019,aquarius,"Is it time to team up? Mercury enters your partnership zone today, shining its light on personal and business relationships. You won’t be in the mood for dealing with anyone who isn’t a team player, so avoid the selfish types. Singles, the next two weeks are a good time to meet a keeper.

"
28 june 2019,aquarius,"You can’t worry about what everyone is thinking, Aquarius. At some point you just have to let that go. You are your own unique person, and you’re entitled to live an authentic life.

"
29 june 2019,aquarius,"No matter what kind of differences of opinion you’ve had with loved ones, it’s time to get past them. A wonderful Mercury aspect enables you and others to put ideas and feelings out there for discussion. Do this now before Mercury retrogrades on July 7th!

"
30 june 2019,aquarius,"Let your freak flag fly? Going along with the group may not be an enticing prospect, so don’t bother. The Moon is in the most creative part of your chart, telling you to do your own thing. Problem is, others may not like it one bit! But who cares–this is your  life, babe.

"
1 july 2019,aquarius,"Got the urge to merge? Mars moves into your house of serious relationships, making you a lot more interested in committing. This could be on a business level as well as a romantic one. There will be two eclipses in July though, so make sure that you connect with people who are willing to work as team players.

"
2 july 2019,aquarius,"Old habits die hard. That reality may have been hitting you lately as you’ve tried to make changes that won’t stick. good news though: a solar eclipse tomorrow in your house of efficiency will help you create new systems that will actually work.

"
3 july 2019,aquarius,"Old habits die hard but honey, they have to go. That’s the message behind today’s solar eclipse in the most efficient part of your chart. Fortunately Venus, planet of ease, glides into this sector today, helping to make things glow more smoothly. It’s almost like it’s New Year’s Day in July, Aquarius! out with the old and in with the new.

"
4 july 2019,aquarius,"From your chart it appears that you’ve been trying to make progress with creating a happier mental state. (Hey, everyone needs to do this!) But a Saturn-North Node opposition could stymie your efforts today. The key is to create new habits, such as meditating every morning, or keeping a gratitude journal. Make it as regular as brushing your teeth if you want it to work!

"
5 july 2019,aquarius,"If you need to straighten things out with a lover or friends, today’s the day. Optimistic Jupiter is well positioned in your house of camaraderie, smoothing the way for better relationships. Do this before Mercury starts to retrograde on Sunday!

"
6 july 2019,aquarius,"What’s more important….a  fabulous sex life, or a strong, steady romance? Hell, can’t you have both? Planetary aspects this weekend could find you pondering this question. With the Moon in the most libidinous part of your chart today, chances are that sex is going to win.

"
7 july 2019,aquarius,"Stop, start, stop, start. That’s what romantic relationships may feel like over the next two weeks! High octane Mars is trying to get things going, but Mercury is now retrograde in the same sector. Business alliances could also get stalled. Don’t fret: this is over on the 19th.

"
8 july 2019,aquarius,"Stop being a martyr and ask other people for help, Aquarius. Otherwise you’re only going to have more work dumped on you, and you’ll be resentful to boot. A good place to start is at home or with your family. To your surprise they might actually be of service!

"
9 july 2019,aquarius,"Breaking old habits and routines isn’t easy, and today could be one of those days when you really feel it. The Sun faces off against Saturn in the heavens, and this brings a battle of wills. Or in your case, your willpower. By the time of the lunar eclipse on the 16th you’ll reach some key decisions about how to handle this.

"
10 july 2019,aquarius,"Money matters pick up steam thanks to a positive Sun-Neptune trine. The recent solar eclipse is motivating you to get things done in less time, and with less effort. Time is money, something that will become your mantra.

"
11 july 2019,aquarius,"Who’s running the “show” known as your life, Aquarius? From your chart it appears that there are too many people trying to butt in and have you do things their way. Hah! You won’t take kindly to it. As a matter of fact, you’ll probably tell them to stick it where the Sun doesn’t shine. Amen!

"
12 july 2019,aquarius,"Like it or not, you do  need the help or advice of others, and right now is a great time to receive it. This weekend is well suited for socializing too, so while you’re meeting with people ask them for what you need.

"
13 july 2019,aquarius,"A friend or contact could be unusually lucky for you, Aquarius. So could someone you spontaneously meet at a seminar or gathering of some kind. Which means that you need to be socializing, so head on out the door and mingle a bit.

"
14 july 2019,aquarius,"A lunar eclipse is approaching in your house of endings, which means that it’s time to say buh-bye to all sorts of garbage that needs to go. Bad habits, negative thought patterns, toxic people, a soul-sucking job: yeah, that kind of stuff. But right now you seem to be resisting it with all your might. What are you, some kind of glutton for punishment? Leave martyrdom to Joan of Arc. Unless, of course, you want to be burned at the stake.

"
15 july 2019,aquarius,"You know how you get the feeling that something just has to give?  Yup, we’ve all been there. Today Aquarians will feel this more than any other sign as the Moon forms a conjunction with Pluto and Saturn in your house of endings. Get ready, because tomorrow’s eclipse puts a great big pair of pruning shears in your hand and tells you to start cutting.

"
16 july 2019,aquarius,"You’ve known for a long while that it’s time for change. Maybe you’ve avoided it. Perhaps you’re embracing it. Either way, today’s lunar eclipse in your house of closure and moving on will take you to a different, better place… whether you believe that or not! You can go kicking and screaming or sashay along with a confident smile on your face. It’s up to you.

"
17 july 2019,aquarius,"What people say they’ll do and what they’ll actually  do are two different things. A Venus-Saturn opposition could make it difficult to discern what’s going on. If possible, wait until Friday before making up your mind. Intelligent Mercury enters one of the most logical parts of your chart then, making this an easy task.

"
18 july 2019,aquarius,"It’s great day for holding practical talks with people. Maybe you need to ask the boss for a raise. Or perhaps you want to know where your romantic relationship is heading. Clear the air with a colleague or friend. You’ll feel better for it.

"
19 july 2019,aquarius,"The recent lunar eclipse occurred in your house of closure and transition. telling you that it’s time to take much better care of yourself. In order to do that, you need better habits to support your physical and mental health. Mercury retrogrades into your house of habits and efficiency today, helping you analyze what you’ve done right and wrong in the past. This phase ends on the 31st, so start developing some productive new routines before then.

"
20 july 2019,aquarius,"No one likes to believe that their thoughts are off base. Our opinions and beliefs can be similar to laws of the universe, kind of like gravity–unalterable! A Venus-Pluto opposition could make you realize that hey, some of the things you believe are  off base, and they need to be corrected. This won’t be an easy process but it is necessary.

"
21 july 2019,aquarius,"OK Aquarius, buckle down and get the grunt work done. This is the Sun’s last day in your efficiency sector, so cut the procrastinating and get caught up. While you’re at it, you might decide to create better habits, and this includes diet and exercise. Tomorrow El Sol will be in a far more romantic place and you won’t want to be cleaning out your closets!

"
22 july 2019,aquarius,"In the mood for love? I sure hope so, because that’s what the cosmos has in mind for Aquarians! Lusty Mars is already in your seventh house of amour and commitment.

There are some fabulous aspects ahead over the next four weeks, so if you’re looking for love–or want to create a deeper bond–the stars are in alignment.

"
23 july 2019,aquarius,"Patching things up with someone is the order of the day, Aquarius. Mars is in your house of diplomacy and partnering, and the Moon is in the house of talking and all forms of self expression. Life is too short to hold grudges, so extend the olive branch.

"
24 july 2019,aquarius,"Push hard at work so that people can see what you’re made of. With Venus and Mercury operating at an expert level in your efficiency zone, you’ll be able to show the muckety mucks that you have talent. Once August rolls around you should see the results of your efforts.

"
25 july 2019,aquarius,"Your sign is famous for being friendly, but cosmic aspects over the next week could turn you into a Class A Social Butterfly. Hey, why not share your fabulousness with an adoring public? A red hot Mars-Jupiter trine will put you in the path of friends, lovers, movers and shakers, and people who share your interests. But this isn’t about making casual acquaintances: there is a feeling of longevity here.

"
26 july 2019,aquarius,"People could get pushy, demanding that you do things their way. The best move is to remain silent and quietly observe what’s going on. You don’t need to let them in on your thoughts; say little and don’t commit. Over the next week you’ll be able to gain more cooperation and authority.

"
27 july 2019,aquarius,"The urge to merge grows stronger as Venus enters your commitment sector. New romantic and business alliances can be formed, while existing ones get a shot of pizzazz injected into them. Mercury is  still retrograde, though, in your house of cooperating and teamwork. If you want things to move forward you need to find balance. One person shouldn’t be doing all of the “heavy lifting” while the other one coasts.

"
28 july 2019,aquarius,"If you’ve had trouble in the past getting through to someone, today might bring a change. A positive Sun-Chiron aspect gives you hope and  eloquence. You’re not stuck, something that you may finally realize.

"
29 july 2019,aquarius,"No one knows better how to push your buttons than family. Your lover may have become a pro at it too. And  they all may be in a button-pushing mood today, so unless you enjoy getting aggravated, avoid them! Some boundaries need to be set but right now isn’t the time. Tomorrow is though.

"
30 july 2019,aquarius,"Unless you’re living alone in a hut on a mountaintop somewhere, you have to deal with other people. So like it or not, you’re going to have to deal with their demands and issues and emotions. If you want to remain serene, you’ll need to find some new ways to handle their sh**, because what you’ve been doing isn’t working. So says the cosmos anyway! The good news is that inspirational Neptune has your back and will provide you with some new tactics.

"
31 july 2019,aquarius,"Remember that song “Whistle while you work” from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves? That’s going to be you over the next two weeks, smiling like a person possessed as you cut through tasks. Yup, Mercury has just gone direct in your house of efficiency and procrastination is OVER. Of course, maybe the dwarves were tossing back some vino as they worked, which means that you can too.

"
1 august 2019,aquarius,"Ready to commit? If so, then the cosmos has your back! The Leo new moon could bring about a deeper connection, not only in love but in business too. Over the next few months singles could meet a new lover. Teaming up for career success is also a good possibility. I have to warn you, though–Uranus squares the new moon, indicating that you’ll be pushed past your comfort zone a bit in these relationships. But that’s what personal growth is all about.

"
2 august 2019,aquarius,"People may be taking you for granted, not realizing that you’ve had enough. Sitting back and taking it is not the best option right now. You know the saying: give people an inch and they’ll take a mile? It applies to you, Aquarius. Just don’t flip out when you tell them to back off.

"
3 august 2019,aquarius,"Feeling sexy and soulful? You should be, thanks to the Moon in the lustiest part of your chart! The entire weekend is well suited for romance. If you’re single, then take this special energy and pamper yourself. Next week could bring a new lover into your life, and you want to be as gorgeous and serene as possible.

"
4 august 2019,aquarius,"Getting in someone’s face simply won’t work, no matter how much you want to! Nope, the best way to gain control over a situation–or fix it–is to sit back and quietly assess what’s going on. Say little and wait til Wednesday, a much better time for getting your point across.

"
5 august 2019,aquarius,"With the Moon in your house of travel and adventure, it’s time to plan something that will put a smile on your face. If you think you can’t afford it, guess again. From your chart it appears that there’s a budget option, if you’re willing to look for it. This also applies to launching a startup or going to school. Seek and ye shall find.

"
6 august 2019,aquarius,"Just when you thought that things were quieting down, someone (or something) comes along and rattles you. Don’t worry though–this passes quickly. By tomorrow you’ll be able to gain the upper hand. It’s just a matter of waiting it out.

"
7 august 2019,aquarius,"You’re in an amazing position to meet people who share your views and dreams. A lovely Sun-Jupiter aspect brings you new connections, from potential friends to colleagues to a lover. Make a vow to spend more time with people you already know, the kind who have your back and never put you down. It’s about quality in your alliances, not quantity.

"
8 august 2019,aquarius,"The world has plenty of people who don’t want to see you succeed and be happy, but there are plenty of others who do. A terrific Venus-Jupiter aspect puts you in touch with like minded people, the kind who can be friends or lovers for life. Be selective about whom you associate with. There’s nothing ruthless about wanting to be around folks who lift you up emotionally.

"
9 august 2019,aquarius,"You’re not the type to wear your heart on your sleeve. As a result, people are often at a loss trying to figure out what is going on in your mind. Today’s a smart time to let a few people in on your thoughts. Make sure that (a) they deserve it and (b) they have your back.

"
10 august 2019,aquarius,"It’s smoother sailing ahead for personal relationships, Aquarius! Jupiter goes direct in your house of friends and teamwork. Smart little Mercury zips into your serious relationship sector, joining the Sun. And Uranus retrogrades in the house that governs your family, which can actually be beneficial! Uranus is erratic when direct, so this should soften its rough edges.

"
12 august 2019,aquarius,"Sshhh! There’s a lot going on in that brain of yours. Thoughts are getting processed and ideas are hatching. Healing occurs and you’re starting to feel better about things. Perfect timing, considering that the full moon on Thursday occurs in your sign. It’s as though mental house cleaning is going on. Buh-bye, cobwebs.

"
13 august 2019,aquarius,"Stubbornness sets in as the Moon is in your sign, opposing Mercury. Make an effort to listen to what others have to say. They may have some valuable insight for you, but you’ll never hear it if you’re too busy having a snit. Believe it or not you don’t have all of the answers.

"
14 august 2019,aquarius,"Getting close to someone becomes so much easier with a Sun-Venus meet up! This could be on a personal or professional level, but love is wonderfully aspected. Between now and the end of August your ability to forge a deep, intimate bond is there. Single Aquarians could meet someone new, especially when Mars changes signs on the 18th.

"
15 august 2019,aquarius,"Gotta love it! Tonight’s full moon occurs in Aquarius, spotlighting every area of your life. All of your hopes, dreams and plans are getting the star treatment. As full moons wrap things up, a closely held ambition or plan could come to pass over the next two weeks. Just keep your family members out of your business, as they could try to influence you to do things their ay.

"
16 august 2019,aquarius,"Uranus is acting up in one of the most sensitive parts of your chart, making you want to rebel against people and situations. The problem is that a lot of this may be in your mind and not based on reality. So before you say or do something you’ll regret, zip your lips and keep your fingers off of the keyboard.

"
17 august 2019,aquarius,"Old habits die hard, something that could be apparent today. Strict Saturn is pushing you to change for your own good, mentally and physically. But you seem to be resisting it. Maybe you need to go about things a different way! Just because a habit is a habit doesn’t mean that it’s the right one for you. Consider other options.

"
18 august 2019,aquarius,"Pay close attention to your thoughts and emotional state, Aquarius. Planets are starting to enter one of the most sensitive parts of your chart, with Mars arriving today.

"
20 august 2019,aquarius,"No matter how much you’d like to be forthright and clear things up with someone, you’re probably not going to get too far. A Moon-Sun square is tying up the lines of communication. They start to loosen up tomorrow, but you’re advised to keep some things confidential for now.

"
21 august 2019,aquarius,"Ggrrr!!!! Sexy Venus joins lusty Mars in your house of intimacy and libido, heating things up quite nicely.

"
22 august 2019,aquarius,"You may need to compromise with others today, even if you don’t like them or agree with them! Just be careful when it comes to money. This is not an area where you should be giving in. Tomorrow the Sun rolls into your net worth sector, so wait until then before making any major decisions.

"
23 august 2019,aquarius,"Get ready for the #feels, Aquarius! The mighty Sun is now in your house of sex, emotions and intimacy. And  net worth I might add. Since love and money are two of the hottest topics out there, you can expect the next four weeks to be pretty intense. This is not a bad thing, however. The opportunity to create a strong emotional and financial foundation is out there if you seek it.

"
24 august 2019,aquarius,"Today promises to be a good one for all signs of the zodiac as Mars and Venus form a conjunction, which means that their energies mesh. Considering that these are the planets and love and sex….and they’re “meshing” in your house of libido and steamy intimacy…you have quite the juicy weekend ahead of you!

"
25 august 2019,aquarius,"Anger and frustration can be useful emotions if they help you realize that you’re not where you should be in life. Otherwise they’re a waste of time and energy. Chiron, the Wounded Healer, asks you to examine your feelings. Because they will color your thoughts, which in turn will choose your actions.

"
26 august 2019,aquarius,"A romantic or family matter could suddenly make a turn for the better, much to your relief. With Uranus active in your house of inner comfort, you definitely need a break from aggravating situations. Be open to what others have to say, and open to the possibility that things can and will improve.

"
27 august 2019,aquarius,"Doubts might start creeping in to your mind, but are they based on reality? Chances are they’re not. Subterranean Pluto is digging deep into your psyche, stirring things up. Don’t make any decisions under this aspect or say something that you’ll regret later. Tomorrow brings clarity.

"
28 august 2019,aquarius,"It’s not your job to fix the world and rescue everyone from their problems, something you may realize today. With healing Uranus in a fabulous aspect from your house of inner comfort, right now you should just be worrying about you. This energy continues into the weekend, when a new moon takes place in this sector. Out with toehold, in with the new!

"
29 august 2019,aquarius,"Ah, peace at last. Logical Mercury enters one of the most emotional parts of your chart, helping you to calm down. Looking at your problems from a more rational place will become easier. If you need to talk with someone, be it a professional or just a friend, do so. Their insight is valuable and will enable you to move forward.

"
30 august 2019,aquarius,"Just what do you need in your life to feel serene and secure? That’s the question asked by today’s new moon in Virgo. What was important to you even a month ago may not even matter anymore. And the next two weeks will bring even more ruminating on your part. Give yourself time to work things out.

"
31 august 2019,aquarius,"If you go through life with too many rules–either for yourself or other people–you’re bound to be disappointed, Aquarius. Not to mention that you’ll make things harder for everyone. Relax and give yourself (and others) permission to do their own thing. Heaven knows our society has enough rules as it is.

"
1 september 2019,aquarius,"At the end of the movie The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy realizes a few things. One is that there is no place like home. But the other (more important) lesson is that she and the other characters–the Cowardly Lion, Tin Man and Scarecrow–all had great things inside of them, wonderful values and skills that they underestimated. That’s the lesson the cosmos has for you today. Go within.

"
2 september 2019,aquarius,"Yowza! This is looking like one passionate  day. Lusty Mars meets up with the Sun, setting your desires on fire.

"
3 september 2019,aquarius,"There’s an authentic voice inside of you that is trying to be heard, Aquarius. But you may not be able to hear it with all of the noise being created by society, social media, the news, and the people you interact with personally. Try to pull away from the incessant “chatter” and listen to what your heart is telling you.

"
4 september 2019,aquarius,"People could be working their own agendas today, but in a very quiet manner. Therefore you need to keep an eagle eye on what they’re saying and doing. The good news is that you intuition is strong. If something doesn’t feel right in your gut, pay attention.

"
5 september 2019,aquarius,"People often laugh and say that psychics, intuition and shamanism are “woo-woo”, but is that really the case? Right now your sign is in a really vibey place. So don’t be surprised if you find yourself studying ancient philosophies or delving into your own sixth sense. It’s amazing what you will discover.

"
6 september 2019,aquarius,"A quiet kind of confidence is sinking in, which is a healthy way to go through life. You don’t need anyone’s opinions or approval. Nor do you need to fit in with a group, or society. This energy continues to build all the way to the full moon on the 14th, and by that time you’ll feel like a new person.

"
1 january 2019,pisces,"Got your list of resolutions at the ready? I sure hope so, because the cosmos is ready too.

"
5 january 2019,pisces,"It’s time to break out of a rut, if you’re in one. Even if you’re not, you should be considering how to switch things up in your life and make them more exciting. It may take a little daring–and you could feel uncomfortable in the process–but it will be worth it.

11 january 2019,pisces,"Who’s true blue in your world, Pisces? It’s time to take an inventory as to whom you can count on, and who’s a fake friend.

"
13 january 2019,pisces,"A power struggle could erupt in a relationship or among friends, and you could be caught in the middle of it. Avoid taking sides. Likewise, a friend may need to hear the truth, but they’re not ready for it. Wait until the end of the week to sit them down.

"
16 january 2019,pisces,"It’s time for you to have some fun. No, really. With the Moon in the most social part of your chart, reach out to friends and plan some kind of escapade. It’s also a good time to plan a bachelor party, family reunion, charity event or group trip.

"
17 january 2019,pisces,"

"
15 march 2019,pisces,"
Others could be critical today, but maybe it’s just because you’re not kowtowing to them. And why should you? Being a pawn in their game is just not what you have in mind. Let them find somebody else to lick their boots.

"
16 march 2019,pisces,"
The Sun is only going to be in your sign for a few more days, so make the most of it. It’s time for one last blast of partying, thanks to Pluto in your house of friendship. Also consider this: who do you want to traveling with you on your journey in the year ahead?

"
17 march 2019,pisces,"
Think before you speak, Pisces. Mercury is retrograde in your sign. The verbal and nonverbal signals that you give off right now could be easily misread. Otherwise, you’re in a terrific position right now to self promote and make a good impression.

"
18 march 2019,pisces,"
You need to figure out a plan and stick to it, Pisces. With the Moon in the most disciplined part of your chart, focus is everything. Once the Sun moves into Aries on Wednesday, you’ll become even more interested in creating ritual and routine.

"
20 march 2019,pisces,"
“Show me the money!” That could be your battle cry as the Sun enters your income sector. You’re in a fabulous place to earn more, as long as you’re not shy about promoting yourself. Which shouldn’t be a problem whatsoever with assertive Mars in your communication sector.

"
21 march 2019,pisces,"
Looking for financial security? Then the Libra full moon is just your ticket for creating a stronger financial foundation. But a Venus-Mars square warns you to vet new opportunities carefully. Don’t chase after “shiny bright things” or fall for slick sales pitches.

"
22 march 2019,pisces,"
It’s time to get serious about saving more money, Pisces. Deadly serious. People say that your self esteem rises and falls with the dollar amount in your bank account, and oftentimes this is true. Start saving and investing wisely now, and by this time next year, you’ll feel like a different person.

"
24 march 2019,pisces,"
This promises to be a good week, because you are going to be inspired in so many ways. Today logical Mercury meets up with creative Neptune in your sign, telling you to seriously consider what you stand for. On Tuesday magnetic Venus glides into Pisces, ramping up your charisma.

Reality hits in a good way today. No need to kid yourself about anything or to beat around the bush with others. Just tell it like it is, to yourself and the people in your world.

"
27 march 2019,pisces,"You could be tempted to put yourself out there a bit today, and this is not a bad thing! Uranus, planet of spontaneity, is on a roll. Go ahead–flirt, opine, meet new people, run around the neighborhood, promote yourself. The world needs to see who you really are!

"
31 march 2019,pisces,"Creating stability, peace and contentment are going to be high on your list, Pisces. Today Mars glides into your domestic sector, the house that deals with your family and your residence. Your inner sense of comfort is found here also. The sun happens to be in your house of ritual and security. Taking chances can wait for another day. Right now you need a drama-free existence.

"
7 april 2019,pisces,"If you want to enjoy life more and achieve grand things, you need to pull other people into your plans. You’ve done enough on your own. Now it’s time to bring in reinforcements!

"
8 april 2019,pisces,"You could hear some news over the next few days that could benefit you enormously. If you do, keep it to yourself. Act on it right away. Even if it’s something that can be shared with a team later on, for now it needs to be kept quiet.

"
9 april 2019,pisces,"It’s time to follow your own path and stop listening to other people, Pisces. They may think they know what is best for you. But you are the best judge of that, all the more reason why you need to do your own thing.

"
10 april 2019,pisces,"Career matters may start to slow down now that gas giant Jupiter is retrograde. But this isn’t anything to get upset about: over the next few months even better possibilities could come your way. That is, if your mind is open to them.

"
11 april 2019,pisces,"You are at your sexiest, most romantic best! The two most gorgeous planets in the solar system, Venus and Neptune, meet up in Pisces. So don’t be surprised if jaws are dropping when you walk by. Somebody’s gotta look smoking hot, and it might as well be you.

"
12 april 2019,pisces,"No matter how logical or diplomatic you may be, people may just be difficult, even critical. You can let this bother you, or you can let it go. It’s just a tempest in a teapot so don’t let it ruin your day.

"
13 april 2019,pisces,"We all have values and standards that are important to us. Some people have high standards, others don’t. Some folks create their own rules and others are easily swayed by their friends, lover or family. What’s important right now is that you create your own rules and live by them. What’s right for you may not be for other people.

"
14 april 2019,pisces,"One of the best things that you could do with your life is to find some new friends, people who share your values and dreams. Hey, if your existing tribe gets you, no problem. But from your chart it appears that you could benefit by surrounding yourself with some visionaries.

"
15 april 2019,pisces,"Stick to the facts today and you’ll do fine. Rely only on optimism and shaky dreams instead, and you’ll screw up. This is a message that’s going to carry forward into the next few weeks, by the way, so get used to it.

"
16 april 2019,pisces,"Touchy! It may be unusually easy for others to push your buttons due to a Moon-Neptune opposition. Unless you want to give them the satisfaction of knowing they were able to irk you, don’t go there. Take a deep breath and count to ten.

"
17 april 2019,pisces,"Money talks, and it’s practically yelling at you right now. Shrewd little Mercury enters your house of income and savings today, to be followed by profitable Venus on Saturday. Pay attention, because over the next few weeks you can really develop a stronger financial base.

"
18 april 2019,pisces,"The most important opinion of yourself is your own, Pisces. Remember that today, as a tense lunar aspect could make you susceptible to the criticism of others. The good news is that you’re about to enter a far more social time when you’ll be in the company of people who will appreciate you.

"
19 april 2019,pisces,"Let it out! This is no time to hold in your feelings. With a full moon taking place in the most emotional part of your chart, it’s the right time to vent. Over the next four weeks you’re going to be quite verbal. People better get used to it.

"
20 april 2019,pisces,"Money talks, Pisces! Profits planet Venus just entered your income sector, and the Sun just zipped into your house of self promotion. The next four weeks are truly the best time in 2019 for letting the world know how talented you are. This could be via social media, your resume, a buzz reel, the lecture circuit or just having cocktails with people who count.

"
21 april 2019,pisces,"People tend not to like the word “discipline” because it conjures up thoughts of hard work, gritted teeth and giving up the juicier things in life. But discipline and better routines can set you free, something that the cosmos reminds you about today. Create some better habits and stick with them.

"
22 april 2019,pisces,"Think before you speak, text or e-mail! Erratic Uranus could prompt you to say something that you shouldn’t. You could also be privy to a scoop today. Things around you are changing rapidly and you need to stay on your toes.

"
23 april 2019,pisces,"Give your career everything you’ve got today. Lucky Jupiter has your back, so if you’re willing to make some effort, it could come back to you in spades. Just be very selective about who you choose to work with and confide in. Right now having a small, tight group of trusted confidantes is the best way to go.

"
24 april 2019,pisces,"Who’s got your back? That’s the question asked by Pluto as it begins to retrograde in your house of friends and colleagues. Don’t feel guilty about becoming very selective about whom you let into your life, Pisces.

"
25 april 2019,pisces,"You need true friends, the kind who will be by your side for years. If you’re already in that situation, bravo! You will make some new friends who will add even more to your life. Over the next three months you should be open to meeting people: join a volunteer group, attend business meet ups, get involved in a softball team, start a book club. It’s all good.

"
27 april 2019,pisces,"Anyone who crosses your path today is going to regret it! A Mars-Neptune square will see to it that you will defend your happiness, reputation or boundaries. This is no time to roll over and do what others want.

"
28 april 2019,pisces,"“When is it going to be my  turn?” That thought could be on your mind. It may seem that everyone else has all of the goodies and you are sitting there with the short end of the stick. Don’t worry…this is going to change around mid-May when Mars enters Cancer.

"
29 april 2019,pisces,"Your personal values may get overhauled in the months ahead. That’s because Saturn begins to retrograde today in the house that governs your most cherished dreams and what’s important to you. If you’ve been comparing yourself to other people, or letting them dictate how to run your life, it’s time for a 180 degree switcheroo.

"
30 april 2019,pisces,"Some major decisions could be ahead of you, and with Neptune squaring Mars, your judgment could be off. Your values are changing too, thanks to Pluto and Saturn both going retrograde. Wait for the new moon on Friday before you make up your mind about anything.

"
1 may 2019,pisces,"Home and family matters need to be taken care of before May 15th. A terrific Mercury-Mars aspect enables you to deal with relatives, landlords and roommates. If you’re looking for a new place to live, it’s a smart time to hunt.

"
2 may 2019,pisces,"Teamwork could grind to a halt as people refuse to do their work or acknowledge their roles. You have verbal Mercury in a calm, cool place, but others may be too busy with their own head trips to get along. By tomorrow the modo changes, though, and you’ll be in charge.

"
3 may 2019,pisces,"Super day for locking in some kind of a deal or promise that will put a smile on your lips: a new job, perhaps, or an engagement. Even if you’re not looking for these things, it’s an auspicious time for going after your heart’s desire.

"
4 may 2019,pisces,"Let it all out! The new moon in your house of self expression allows you to say what’s on your mind. The next few months are well aspected for absorbing information, talking things over with others and showcasing your talent. Taking short trips out of town is also on the cosmos’s agenda.

"
5 may 2019,pisces,"You could be in a critical mood, so be careful how you word things. The opposite could be true as well: people are snippy and in your face. It’s important not to make enemies right now, so be diplomatic and let some things slide.

"
6 may 2019,pisces,"Can we talk? Verbal Mercury is now in your house of communicating. This sector also governs the way you think and express yourself through writing and the arts. You are in an awesome position to dazzle others with your ideas and eloquence. Team up with other people who share your views.

"
7 may 2019,pisces,"People may fail to meet your expectations today, Pisces. You’re going to have to ask yourself this question: are your standards set too high? If that’s the case, then you’re setting yourself up for disappointment on a regular basis. But if not, then you have the right to be annoyed!

"
8 may 2019,pisces,"Go loud and proud, Libra! A vivacious Mercury-Uranus aspect tells you to shout it from the mountaintops, whatever “it” means to you. A video could go viral. Your resume could land on the right person’s desk. The person you’re dying to date says “yes”. You decide to run for political office. Yup, there’s no holding you back!

"
9 may 2019,pisces,"Luck is on your side when it comes to finding a new job or scoring a raise. This is also a smart time to beef up your revenues if you’re self-employed. Even in romance, you can create more stability within a relationship. A Jupiter-Venus trine enables you to create a lot more stability in your life.

"
10 may 2019,pisces,"The majority rules today, Pisces. Like it or not you’re going to have to go with what others want. But don’t sweat it; this is a short lived aspect. Tomorrow the tide turns in your favor and you can provide your input, with the expectation that people will be paying attention.

"
11 may 2019,pisces,"Solidify your relationships with people who count, Pisces. This could be friends, a lover, a group at the office or a team you spend time with outside of work. It’s also an auspicious time for aligning yourself with movers and shakers, the kind of folks who can take you to a better life. If you can’t find them in real life, go online and listen to podcasts.

"
12 may 2019,pisces,"Just how motivated are you to look good and feel vibrant, Pisces? With the Moon in your house of health and fitness, you might be looking at yourself in the mirror and saying, “Uh, this has to change.” With so much planetary activity in your house of friends this is a smart time to find an exercise buddy, someone who will sweat along with you.

"
13 may 2019,pisces,"Are you associating with the right kind of people? Make an effort to meet people who are going somewhere. They’re having fun, traveling, thinking outside of the box and they’re willing to take chances. You need to do the same. There’s no need to dump the existing tribe, unless your values have become completely different from their’s.

"
14 may 2019,pisces,"If you need to have a discussion with a parent, an ex, or a lover try to do so today. This is especially true if there is a living arrangement that needs to be finalized, or an argument that should be cleared up. Helpful Venus and strong willed Mars are in a good place to help you, but tomorrow they move on. Carpe diem.

"
15 may 2019,pisces,"Life gets a lot livelier (and friskier!) thanks to the two cosmic lovers moving to new places in the heavens. Amorous Venus sashays into your third house of flirting and socializing, while lusty Mars swaggers into the house of romance. Pisces, you are in one hell of a position to have a good time! It’s worth noting that the sector Venus is in happens to govern your local neighborhood, so singles…stop looking online and work the neighborhood instead.

"
16 may 2019,pisces,"It takes teamwork to make the dream work, and you may be the person who keeps the team in line. A Mercury-Saturn aspect indicates that people need to be reminded about what their roles and responsibilities are. With mature Saturn in your communicating sector, you may be the only grown-up in the group!

"
17 may 2019,pisces,"Your self talk is a big predictor of how happy and successful you’ll be, today and in the future. So if you are constantly telling yourself that you’re worthless and you can’t do something, you’re looking at nothing but misery. A productive Mercury-Jupiter aspect helps you change the way you look at life and the manner in which you treat yourself.

"
18 may 2019,pisces,"It’s time to get out of your comfort zone. Whether you’re ready or not, the cosmos is going to give you a swift kick in the butt to get you going: the full moon in Scorpio. You need to meet new people and be exposed to philosophies that are radically different from the same old views of the past. FYI: there could also be a surprising, interesting scoop that comes your way.

"
19 may 2019,pisces,"Circumstances or people in your world could be pushing you past your comfort zone, and it could be draining. But that goes with the territory, my friend. As Taoist master Deng Ming Dao says, “All growth comes with a shock.” You’re strong and resilient, and you can do this.

"
20 may 2019,pisces,"A nagging little voice in your head may be telling you that you shouldn’t try something. Or that you’ll never be able to pull it off. Old negative programming from childhood may be the culprit here. The good news is that the Sun enters your house of domestic matters tomorrow, which will enable you to come to grips with this erroneous thinking!

"
21 may 2019,pisces,"They say that no one can drive you crazy faster than family, and I think there there is some truth in that statement! So if your family members have been working your nerves, you’ll be happy to know that the authoritative Sun rolls into your house of domestic matters today. So does logical, verbal Mercury. It’s time to set things straight in the most diplomatic manner possible.

"
22 may 2019,pisces,"An interesting scoop could come your way, thanks to unpredictable Uranus acting up in your communication sector! Or a lover could surprise you with a spontaneous night out on the town. Singles, you could meet someone under unusual  circumstances. Yep, it’s that kind of a day. Do I hear any complaining?

"
23 may 2019,pisces,"There could be a big divide between what you want and what others want, Pisces. Remember that everyone has different values and dreams. If you try to force your vision on others it could backfire. Patience.

"
24 may 2019,pisces,"It may seem as though the forces around you are strong and can’t be vanquished. That may be true: today. But by tomorrow the cosmic winds will have shifted and things will move in your favor. Better yet, you’ll feel stronger and in control.

"
25 may 2019,pisces,"You can try to rule by force, which is what most people do. Or you can subtly gain control of situations by quietly receding into the background and working hard behind the scenes. The cosmos recommends the latter. Stealth has its rewards!

"
26 may 2019,pisces,"You’re starting to realize that you don’t have to get upset over every tiny little thing that happens. Peace of mind is becoming a lot more important to you. You know what they say: don’t sweat the small stuff. If you make this your mantra, you will be in a much better head space.

"
27 may 2019,pisces,"A lot of internet and publishing gurus hype the idea of getting in touch with your authentic self. But there really may be something to it! If you feel as though you’re not living in an authentic manner, a wonderful lunar aspect will help you dig deep and find out who you really are.

"
28 may 2019,pisces,"People may act like they know what they’re talking about… but do they? Don’t assume just because someone appears to be an authority figure that they know what’s going on. With the moon in your sign, your intuition is running high. Pay attention to it. Your own inner wisdom may be the smartest voice out there.

"
29 may 2019,pisces,"Someone may try to give you advice and if you’re wise you will listen. But your ruler, Neptune, is acting a bit cranky and doesn’t want to take orders from anyone else. Hey, you don’t have to make a decision right now. Just hear out what the other person has to say and let it sink in.

"
30 may 2019,pisces,"Someone may try to show you who’s boss. Or they may think that they know more than you. Hah! As if. But don’t rub their noses in the fact that you’re the one with the smarts. Let them fall flat on their faces and figure it out later. It’s called karma, my friend.

"
31 may 2019,pisces,"You simply can’t go wrong this weekend with a Neptune-Venus trine. You’ll be at your charismatic best, and with Venus in your house of socializing, it’s in the best interest of the public for you to be out there! Have fun.

"
1 june 2019,pisces,"With charismatic Venus in your house of communicating, you’ve got the gift of gab….so work it! Let people know what’s in your heart and mind. They need to know where you’re coming from. Sometimes all you have to do is put an idea out there, and people will flock to you.

"
2 june 2019,pisces,"You need to start networking, Pisces. Find people who share your interests. Start surrounding yourself with others who are going places, who know how to live life to the fullest. Join a master mind group. Make new friends. It’s time to branch out.

"
3 june 2019,pisces,"If you give all your power to other people, you will never be at peace. That’s the message behind today’s new Moon in Gemini. This happens to be the house that governs your home and family, but it also deals with inner contentment. Start weeding out people who want to control you. You’re an adult and you don’t have to act like dog responding to its master.

"
4 june 2019,pisces,"Yes. Mercury is in your house of romance, fun and creativity. Over the next three weeks you can explore a side of yourself that has been pushed aside by stress and work demands. Some interesting and unexpected things could come your way over the next few days, so keep an open mind and be ready to take advantage of them!

"
5 june 2019,pisces,"No one knows how to work your nerves like family, and they could be loaded for bear today. Arguments could erupt as old resentment comes to the fore. Avoid this if at all possible. Thursday and Friday have much better energy, and matters could actually get resolved.

"
6 june 2019,pisces,"If you want to get someone’s attention, a gentle touch will do. There’s no need to be flashy or loud. You have a lot going for you; just let it shine naturally.

"
7 june 2019,pisces,"Spontaneity rules as unpredictable Uranus is in the mood for fun, flirting, shopping and dining out. Don’t you think it’s time to treat yourself? Hell yeah!

"
11 june 2019,pisces,"There are only 24 hours in a day, and so much you can do. If your job, errands and commitments are cutting into your personal time, you may need to reduce the hours you’re spending there. The full moon on the 17th ought to help you cut back on career demands at the very least.

"
12 june 2019,pisces,"Some nice things will be coming your way, and you deserve to enjoy them. Quit thinking that love and fun and money and happiness are things that only other people can experience. It’s your turn now, Pisces.

"
13 june 2019,pisces,"A battle may be brewing over your private life and what should go public. Don’t be afraid to let people know that there are limits to what you intend to expose. After all, you are entitled to your own secluded world.

"
14 june 2019,pisces,"A lusty, lively Mars-Neptune trine urges you to have as much fun as possible this weekend. But choose your companions well. Anyone who is a downer need not be around!

"
15 june 2019,pisces,"Which would you prefer: to live in the past, the present or the future? If you’re happy with the present, so be it. But if not, then focus on what lies ahead. As for dwelling in the past? Who needs it?

"
16 june 2019,pisces,"You need some time for just enjoying life, without a lot of drama coming from friends or a lover. So choose your company wisely this week, as tense aspects on Wednesday could stir up heavens know what. If this means going it alone, so be it.

"
17 june 2019,pisces,"Ready for kudos? A raise and a promotion? A new gig? It could happen soon, thanks to the full moon in your career zone. Actually, all of your big plans are spotlighted by this lunation, so expect some happy news. Just be clear as to where you’re heading next, as Neptune, your ruler, is in a funky spot.

"
18 june 2019,pisces,"Meeting new people is well aspected under today’s planetary skies, so be open minded! From your chart it appears that some of the people in your world are too rigid. No problem: some flexible movers and shakers are on the horizon.

"
19 june 2019,pisces,"Differences of opinion could arise under today’s cloudy cosmic skies. You might also realize that your values don’t match those of other people, including loved ones. You’ll have the opportunity to work this out, though, once the Sun changes signs on Friday.

"
20 june 2019,pisces,"Open mouth, insert foot? You could really say (or text) the wrong thing today, thanks to unreliable Uranus acting up in your communicating sector. Think twice, my friend. Neptune starts to retrograde tomorrow in Pisces, and you’ll become quite reflective.

"
21 june 2019,pisces,"Your ruler, Neptune, starts to retrograde in Pisces today. Questioning who you are and where you’re heading in life could be the end result. Hey, this is a good thing—everyone needs to do this, otherwise they’ll be stuck in a rut. Coincidentally the Sun enters your house of romance, so you may be pensive about your love life first.

"
22 june 2019,pisces,"The Sun just entered your house of romance and creativity…so what are you waiting for? You need to shake up this part of your life for the better. Even if you don’t lift a finger to do so, the solar eclipse on July 3rd will grab you by the shirt collar and drag you into a more colorful place. No point in waiting for that to happen—take some baby steps today.

"
23 june 2019,pisces,"From your chart it appears that you need some down time for yourself and loved ones. Don’t get caught up in late hours at the office or bringing work home. If you are too driven to achieve goals, you may end up alienating the people you care about the most. Maintain the proper balance!

"
24 june 2019,pisces,"You tend to be the sensitive sort and this is admirable. But sometimes ya just gotta deal with things head on with no emotion involved. Today is one of those times, so man or woman up and get to it!

"
25 june 2019,pisces,"With Neptune retrograde in your sign, you may feel a bit discombobulated. More structure is needed in your life and today brings a lunar aspect that will help you create it. This may mean getting rid of old habits and beliefs, bus so be it!

"
26 june 2019,pisces,"The Sun is in your house of wining, dining and frivolity, but Mercury says “Uh, you need to get some stuff done.” The messenger planet just entered your house of efficiency, so just suck it up and get things done already. If you don’t do so before July 7th–when Mercury goes retrograde–you’ll regret slacking off!

"
28 june 2019,pisces,"Friendship counts for a lot so be there for someone if they need it. Likewise, you should feel free to reach out to a friend or colleague if there is something on your mind.

"
29 june 2019,pisces,"Take it easy on yourself, Pisces. With Mercury in your house of efficiency you are probably motivated to get as much done as possible. But you run the risk of burning out, so take a break if you need one. Tomorrow will arrive and your to-do list will still be there.

"
30 june 2019,pisces,"Sometimes we set goals or have opinions and then fiercely stick to them….even if they’re no longer right for us. A Moon-Jupiter opposition could make you feel uncomfortable as you realize that something needs to change. Pay attention!

"
1 july 2019,pisces,"The pace of life picks up now that Mars is in the most efficient part of your chart. You’re going to want to get things done so that you can relax and enjoy life more. Discipline has its rewards!

"
2 july 2019,pisces,"People might be way too opinionated, butting into your business…even if they mean well! Cosmic energy this week could make you wary of letting others know too much about what is going on in your life. No big deal: you’re under no obligation to let them know everything.

"
3 july 2019,pisces,"Yeah, baby! A whopping solar eclipse takes place in your house of having fun and enjoying the sweeter things in life…like romance, shopping, dining, luxury, and socializing. It’s a tough job but somebody’s gotta do it. Might as well be a Pisces! But when you choose people to spend time with, make sure that they’re not simply looking out for themselves. You need generous, fun people who have your back.

"
4 july 2019,pisces,"Does it seem as though everyone wants a piece of you? Friends and family may be vying for your time and attention, Pisces. There’s nothing wrong with that unless they start getting cranky about it. Remember to pay attention to the people who you really want in your life over the long term.

"
5 july 2019,pisces,"You could feel the urge to get organized this weekend as the moon is in the most efficient part of your chart. So go ahead, dive in….to the basement, garage, closet, e-mail account, whatever. Face the scary goblins that lurk underneath the piles o’ stuff and vanquish them.

"
6 july 2019,pisces,"The Moon glides into your house of serious relationships, and the mood is light and carefree. You may feel like talking about deep issues but this weekend is geared more for flirting and play time. The big issues can wait a few days.

"
7 july 2019,pisces,"Cooperation counts, and you’ll be paying close attention to the people you can count on….and those you can’t. Mercury is now retrograde in your house of teamwork and getting things done. Don’t cut someone slack if they don’t deserve it. And make sure that you’re pulling your own weight, both at the office and in your personal life.

"
8 july 2019,pisces,"It may be a Monday but it’s a fabulous time for being spontaneous, creative and flirty! (Hmmmm…..should you call in sick? Not a bad idea.) A spunky Venus-Uranus aspect brings sizzle to shopping, romancing and dining out. Go out there and have some fun.

"
9 july 2019,pisces,"You don’t need friends or colleagues who bring extra drama into your life, something that is becoming apparent. So consider who you’re hanging out with and why. If a relationship is too lopsided or troublesome, it may be time to move on.

"
10 july 2019,pisces,"Your ability to let go and enjoy life increases due to an inspirational Neptune aspect. What’s the point in holding grudges and rehashing crummy memories? Learn how to live for the moment. Carpe diem–seize the day!

"
11 july 2019,pisces,"Someone could have a meltdown today as unpredictable Uranus squares volatile Mars. Hopefully it won’t be you. But you could be at the receiving end of this, and pushing back won’t help things–it will only make them worse. When the Moon enters the most authoritative part of your chart tomorrow, you’ll be able to calmly get the situation under control.

"
12 july 2019,pisces,"Flying by the seat of your pants just isn’t going to cut it this weekend, so slow down and take your time. Thinks about what absolutely has  to get done. Take care of that first and then go off and enjoy yourself!

"
13 july 2019,pisces,"Right now you’ve got such good cosmic mojo going on that a lot of things will start going your way. Which will make people say, “Oh, you’re just lucky.”  The hell you are. You’ve put a lot of effort into reaching this place. It’s just that you make it look so darn easy!

"
14 july 2019,pisces,"People may be working your nerves, especially close connections. You can blame it on a lot of things; the upcoming lunar eclipse in your house of friends and acquaintances. Or today’s stinky Sun-Pluto opposition. Everyone has an opinion and people are being petty on top of it. You can choose to join the fray or walk away from it.

"
15 july 2019,pisces,"Take an inventory today of the people in your world. Who has your back? Who knows you best, and always comes  through with a smile and a kind word? Right now planetary activity in your chart asks you to remain in only the strongest, most mature relationships. Flakes and drama queens need not apply.

"
16 july 2019,pisces,"Who’s on Team Pisces? That’s the question asked by the lunar eclipse in your house of friends and networking. Not everyone will make the cut. If someone has been more of a frenemy than a true BFF, it may be time to cut the tie and move on. The good news is that new people will be coming into your life, the kind who share your values.

"
17 july 2019,pisces,"Make sure that you’re on the same page with people, Pisces. A Saturn-Venus opposition may blind you into overlooking key differences that exist. These are the kinds of differences that could make or break a relationship or plan down the road, so take care of this now.

"
18 july 2019,pisces,"Got charisma? Check. Creativity? Check. An air of mystery? Double check! Yeah, you’ve got it going on today, Pisces. A wonderful Venus-Neptune trine makes you the person to listen to and watch. Also the person to flirt with!

"
19 july 2019,pisces,"How deep is your love? That’s the question asked by the cosmos as Mercury retrogrades into your house of romance. Two eclipses earlier this month have made you focus on love and your relationships with friends. Don’t mistake the need for having a little independence with walking away from certain connections. If you need some down time, take it.

"
20 july 2019,pisces,"People may be quite determined to get their way. If you try to do things your  way, they might accuse of you of failing to be a team player. Whatever. This is nothing to worry about, as cosmic activity over the next few days helps everyone lighten up.

"
21 july 2019,pisces,"OK, it’s time to get the stardust out of your eyes and get real. The Sun will be entering the most efficient, practical part of your chart tomorrow. Today it forms a perfect line with realistic Mercury in your house of romance and creativity, telling you to be clear headed about love and your talents in the workplace. The good news is that over the next four weeks you’ll be able to make make headway in both areas.

"
22 july 2019,pisces,"It’s kind of like New Year’s Day in July for members of your sign. The Sun is in Leo, your sixth house of habits and discipline. So if you fell off the wagon back around January 8th with your 2019 resolutions, now’s the time to get back on it. Diet and exercise regimens are especially favored as Leo governs your physique and vitality. Get organized at home and at the office too.

"
23 july 2019,pisces,"With aggressive Mars in your can-do sixth house of efficiency, nothing is going to faze you. No project will be too large. No deadline will shatter your confidence. Hell, a boot camp exercise program will seem like an interesting challenge rather than something to run from. So get ready, Pisces. As they say in the movies: “All right men, I’m going in!”

"
24 july 2019,pisces,"You’ve never been someone to hold back when it comes to chasing after a dream. But sometimes you just have to wait for the right cosmic energy to be in place to do so. Well Aries, a terrific Mercury-Venus link opens up doors. Get ready to walk through them.

"
25 july 2019,pisces,"People need to know that you’re capable of making things happen, that you’ll move mountains if you have to. Fortunately you’ve got that “rainmaker” vibe going on thanks to a Jupiter-Mars trine. So don’t feel guilty about showing off. As long as you back up your words with solid action, you’re the one to watch….and trust.

"
26 july 2019,pisces,"Team work makes the dream work? Yeah, that sounds  good, but is it really happening? The reality is that you may need to rally the troops and get people off their sorry asses. That won’t be a problem either, not with the fiery Sun and assertive Mars in the most efficient part of your chart. Just don’t become a tyrant in the process.

"
27 july 2019,pisces,"Getting things done becomes a heck of a lot easier now that Venus is in your house of productivity. This includes stuff around the house and at the office, but also things like diet and fitness. Since Venus is all about beauty, there’s nothing with working out for the sole purpose of obtaining a revenge body.

"
28 july 2019,pisces,"Sometimes we feel like we’re stuck. Moving forward seems so daunting, so draining. Yet if we make one tiny little adjustment it can act like a snowball rolling down a hill, gaining mass and momentum as it picks up speed. A Sun-Chiron aspect helps you identify that one little change and get going with it.

"
29 july 2019,pisces,"Ouch! What what you say or out in writing, Pisces. Unpredictable Uranus is acting out in your house of self expression. Even if you are convinced that you are 100% correct about something, you still need to appear  to be a team player. Remember, appearances are everything.

"
30 july 2019,pisces,"Anyone who tries to dump their work on you, or take advantage of your kind nature, is in for a big surprise. You’re not going to fall for it, but you’re not going to flip out either. Nope, you’re going to smile sweetly, wish them well, gracefully make an excuse and sashay away. They will be confused (good) and get stuck with their own problems (better).

"
31 july 2019,pisces,"“Romeo, Romeo, wherefore ART thou, dude?” If your love life has been somewhat lackluster—or downright confusing–take heart. Mercury is now direct in the house of love. Single Pisces could meet someone new between now and August 11th. Couples can get back on the same page and miscommunication will end. (Wonder if Mercury was in retrograde when Juliet drank that fake poison. Probably. Classic, epic Mercury retro fail.)

"
1 august 2019,pisces,"All talk and no action leads to a place called “Nowhere”. That’s the message behind today’s new moon in your house of productivity! It’s time to stop procrastinating and talking about the things that you intend  to do. Don’t let others pull you off track either, with their opinions and half-baked plans. Once Jupiter goes direct on August 11th things will develop momentum; make sure that you’re ready.

"
2 august 2019,pisces,"Think before you speak, Pisces. Erratic Uranus is acting up in your communicating zone, which means that you could say or do something that you might regret. Try to play nice with others, even if they deserve to be blasted to the far side of the moon. Things turn around for you next week.

"
3 august 2019,pisces,"Seek out people who know how to give, Pisces. There are far too many takers in the world. There is a lot of selfless, cooperative energy in your chart right now. Make sure the people in your circle deserve the kindness and generosity that you’re giving them.

"
4 august 2019,pisces,"Get ready to rally the troops, Pisces. Over the next two weeks you’re going to be the one who gets everyone else in gear, starting today. This could be your family or friends. Maybe it’s a team at the office. If you sit around and wait for them to get inspired, you’ll be waiting for a long time….and you’ll end up doing all of the grunt work.

"
5 august 2019,pisces,"The Moon governs our moods and emotions, which can be a good thing or a bad one! Fortunately La Luna is in a balanced place today, forming a solid aspect with Neptune in your sign. The entire week ahead has a practical vibe to it. It’s time to feel better about yourself inside, and that starts with logical thinking.

"
6 august 2019,pisces,"Trying to get through to people using common sense may not work, but what can you do? Nothing. Erratic Uranus is making people full of themselves, unwilling to listen to sound advice. Don’t waste your time. Eventually they’ll figure things out for themselves, which could get messy. But that’s their path in life.

"
7 august 2019,pisces,"Got #goals? Then you’re in luck, literally! Jupiter–the planet that’s famous for being generous–forms a fabulous aspect in your house of big dreams. It trines the Sun in your house of productivity. What this means is that if you’re willing to hustle, things are going to happen. Goodies won’t drop into your lap, but they’ll show up once you set things in motion.

"
8 august 2019,pisces,"Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want in life, Pisces. It’s not selfish; it’s necessary! First of all, people aren’t mind readers. Second, your planetary aspects are smokin’ hot for actually getting what you desire. The goodies won’t be delivered to you on a silver platter but if you’re willing to put yourself out there, you ca obtain them.

"
9 august 2019,pisces,"Before you make a promise to someone, make sure that you can deliver on it. This is just as true in love as it is in business, Pisces. Consider this though: isn’t it easier to make a promise to someone if they have similar values and goals as you? If you find yourself surrounded by people who are coming from another planet, maybe it’s time to reassess your connections.

"
10 august 2019,pisces,"Are you trying to do too much? Then stop kidding yourself about what can be done in 24 hours. Or are you procrastinating like the worst slug on the planet? Then get off your sorry butt! A Sun-Neptune aspect is a wakeup call for being as productive as possible, without burning yourself out. This is super important as tomorrow brings three  big aspects that will push you to higher levels.

"
11 august 2019,pisces,"Woo-hoo! Optimism and energy return as jovial Jupiter goes direct in your house of ambition and success. Sharp-as-a-tack Mercury glides into your efficiency sector, helping you cut through projects quickly. And Uranus starts to retrograde in your house of self-expression, which means that you need to think before you speak or take action.

"
12 august 2019,pisces,"Best friends forever? Yes! a wonderful Saturn-Moon aspect solidifies your ties with good friends, and it might also introduce you to new people. This is great time to join a club or lend a hand to a volunteer organization. Joining an elite team within your industry (or a mastermind) is also a possibility. Oh, and friends could play matchmaker too!

"
13 august 2019,pisces,"Things (and people) may not be what they seem today, so remain alert. Even if everything looks perfectly logical and correct, take your time to suss things out. Your intuition could be off today, but it’s right on point as of Thursday, so wait til then to use your Spidey sense.

"
14 august 2019,pisces,"The couple that plays together stays together? You can reach your fitness goals more quickly if you and your lover agree  on a diet and exercise plan that involves you both. Of course, if your lover is into boot camp and you’re into ballet, you may need to find a sport that you both enjoy. Single Pisces, I almost hate to say this, but the gym (argh!) could actually be a good place to meet someone. I know that they are often meat markets but there could be a filet mignon in there somewhere.

"
15 august 2019,pisces,"The full moon in Aquarius is here, and it’s your annual opportunity to “take out the trash”. You know: toxic people. Frenemies. A soul-sucking job. Your own bad habits. Poor dietary choices. Mental loops that focus on unhappy experiences from the past. The good news is that other planets will help you create (and stick to) better habits and choices. Just don’t tell the entire free world how done you are with everything, because some trolls may try to sabotage your efforts.

"
16 august 2019,pisces,"Feeling hemmed in? That could be the case due to a Uranus-Mercury square. You just want to do your own thing and be at ease. The problem is that others have expectations. Should you fight this battle? Hmm….maybe not. Things start to get easier next week, so be a team player for now.

"
17 august 2019,pisces,"You need people around you who are true blue, Pisces. Face it, you’re loyal and have depth of character. The people in your world should be the same way, otherwise you’ll end up becoming resentful. Make the right choices.

"
18 august 2019,pisces,"Who loves ya, baby? That question will be on your mind in a big way over the next four weeks. Lusty, energetic Mars enters your commitment sector, firing up your love life. If you’re saying “what love life?” then get ready, because September is off the charts amazing for finding serious romance. Things start to heat up this week. Already attached? Things could go anywhere from really argumentative to incredible peaceful and rewarding. Just take it day by day.

"
19 august 2019,pisces,"It’s not easy being so talented and efficient, but hey…you are! And other people may not like it one bit. That’s their problem. If they want to have your ability they should try working as hard as you do. You’ve earned it, honey. Don’t forget that.

"
20 august 2019,pisces,"No matter how convincing someone may be, you cannot accept anything at face value today. People may be trying to get away from doing their fair share. Unless you want to get stuck doing their responsibility, walk away and let them handle it for themselves.

"
21 august 2019,pisces,"Practical matters start to get shoved to the back burner now that amorous Venus is in your house of love. Make sure to schedule some quality time with your honey. Single Pisces are in an excellent position to meet someone new, and this is a keeper, not a player. This coming Saturday is especially favored for all Pisces when it comes to romance.

"
22 august 2019,pisces,"The cosmos sends you a reality check, Pisces. You may think that you’re doing things the smartest way possible, but it appears that there’s room for improvement. Do you want to keep on getting the same results? No? Then switch things up.

"
23 august 2019,pisces,"If you were hoping for some quiet time alone, you’d better grab it quickly. The Sun is entering your house of partnering with others and things are going to be quite busy over the next few weeks. That said, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to bond with a lover or meet someone new. Next week brings some unusual but happy surprises!

"
24 august 2019,pisces,"Sparks fly as Mars and Venus are active in your commitment sector! It’s a good day for single Pisces to meet someone new (and all next week is good too, I might add). For those of you who are attached, this could be a passionate day. Keep drama to a minimum and focus on simply enjoying each others’ company.

"
25 august 2019,pisces,"They say that in order to break the rules, first you must master them. That’s the energy on tap today, Pisces. What routines and rules should you stick with, and which ones need to go? Because cosmic energy later this week encourages you to start shaking things up.

"
26 august 2019,pisces,"Things take a spontaneous turn as lively Uranus is in the mood for stirring up some fun. You could run into an old friend or meet the new love of your life. Maybe you’ll decide to take a few days off and play. Whatever transpires, it’s clear that you won’t be alone–so make plans with the people you care about!

"
27 august 2019,pisces,"People could be quite demanding, expecting you to go along with their ideas or plans. But a lunar aspect is making you more interested in doing your own thing. Don’t be afraid to tell them no, and expect to get some flak for it. For what it’s worth your “thing” is a lot more fun and relaxed.

"
28 august 2019,pisces,"Compromises may be necessary but they could happen a lot more easily than you’d expect. A terrific Mars-Uranus aspect opens up lines of communication. This week is one of the best times in 2019 to express yourself, so don’t hold back. You might be surprised to discover that your words hit the mark.

"
29 august 2019,pisces,"The ability to win people over to your side increases, Pisces! Calm and logical Mercury is now in your house of diplomacy. This is good thing, as fast-moving (but positive) news could come your way. Changes are afoot. Being in a practical state of mind is an auspicious place to be.

"
30 august 2019,pisces,"Sometimes you just need to get out of your own way, Pisces. That’s the message behind today’s new moon. Stop being so focused on your own agenda and needs and consider what other people are up to. Some very interesting people could come into your world soon; are you open to meeting them, and even more–learning from them?

"
31 august 2019,pisces,"From your chart it looks like you’re “peopled out”, so don’t be surprised if you just feel like being alone. With the Moon in a social spot, however, you’re still going to be in the company of others. Pick the sanest people you know and shut out everyone else, at least for 24 hours!

"
1 september 2019,pisces,"There’s a difference between having trivial fun and enjoying true quality time with people. Right now the planets urge you to focus on the people who mean the most to you. Create some memories that will last a long time.

"
2 september 2019,pisces,"Everyone will be an expert today, so expect opinions to be flowing. Whether you’re interested in hearing them or not is another matter! There may actually be some good advice mixed in with the bad though, so keep an open mind.

"
3 september 2019,pisces,"Someone has to take charge of a situation and it might as well be you, Pisces! But don’t try to take on too much by yourself. Planets in the diplomatic, partnering part of your chart recommend getting other people involved. If there is confusion in a romantic relationship, then you need to initiate a conversation. But both of you need to communicate and resolve the matter.

"
4 september 2019,pisces,"Right now you need to be dealing with people who are straightforward, not the kind who talk in circles. However, a Venus-Neptune opposition could put you in the path of wishy-washy flakes who can’t figure out what they want to eat for lunch, let alone make a serious decision. Things improve tomorrow. But you may have to pull away from the flakes as time goes on.

"
5 september 2019,pisces,"Creating stronger bonds with loved ones AND business connections is a strong possibility, thanks to a Mercury-Saturn trine. You’re currently in a place where teamwork and diplomacy matter, not just on your part, but everyone’s. New people could come into your life who will stand the test of time too. This is no time to be a loner, Pisces. Share your wonderful personality with the world.

"
6 september 2019,pisces,"The urge to be around people who share your values grows ever stronger, Pisces. You’re getting tired of the kind of folks who want to keep doing things the same old way. Start seeking out movers and shakers, partners in crime, and friends who are true blue. You don’t have to dump everyone else: just add in some spice!

"
