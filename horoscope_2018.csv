1 october 2018,aries,"Someone may demand that you stick to the rules today, and if you’re smart you will. This is not a time to be a rebel. To be honest, the other individual maybe on some kind of power trip. But if you don’t play nice they could make your life miserable.

"
2 october 2018,aries,"Your sign is famous for being frank and open, but this is not a good time to speak your mind. Nor should you mouth off to people, especially if they are authority figures. This is true even if people are on power trips and want to push you (and others) around. Wait until the new Moon next Monday, a much better time for being blunt.

"
3 october 2018,aries,"Awww!!!!  You could feel all warm and fuzzy today, Aries. With the Moon and Venus in the most sensitive, nostalgic parts of your chart you should be reminiscing. And dreaming. And telling someone how much you love them. Or fantasizing about someone new coming into your life. By the way, this could actually happen as of the new Moon on Monday.

"
4 october 2018,aries,"Writer’s block, feeling stuck, confused about which direction to go in….this can happen today with a Moon-Uranus square. And you could get quite annoyed too! This energy could last for up to a week, but you should be out of the woods by Thuesday the 11th.

"
7 october 2018,aries,"It’s not your role in life to bail everyone out of their never-ending problems. It’s one thing to be helpful to others, and another to get dumped on. Leave martyrdom to the saints.

"
8 october 2018,aries,"Today’s new Moon can solidify your relationships with others in a wonderful way, in business and in your personal life. Single and looking? This is the best time all year to find a keeper. But a Moon-Uranus square warns that you must keep your financial expectations with these people clear.

"
9 october 2018,aries,"Now that Mercury is in Scorpio, you may want to keep things under wraps. Scorpio is a secretive sign. The entire free world doesn’t need to know what you’re thinking or working on. But do open up to your lover, as this is a wonderful aspect for building a stronger bond.

"
10 october 2018,aries,"Emotions will be raw today, on your part and that of others. Which means that you need to be mindful about what you say and do. In matters of the heart, don’t push too hard in order to get things done your way: it could backfire big time.

"
11 october 2018,aries,"Yesterday was not an easy one, and tomorrow looks tense also! But today is a good time to speak your piece. Stop sucking it up; be authoritative but calm. People may not be used to you taking control of situations, but they’d better get used to it!

"
12 october 2018,aries,"People could be contentious today, unwilling to cooperate. But fortunately for you, calm Mercury will help keep your emotions in check. Next week will be far better for seizing control of situations—and I do mean “seize”!

This energy lasts through Tuesday so you’ll have several days to run with it.

"
14 october 2018,aries,"Great day for making long term decisions about the future! Locking in smart new habits is also favored. What’s the reason? The passionate Moon lines up perfectly with mature, disciplined Saturn in your house of goals and success.

"
15 october 2018,aries,"Let it all hang out! No, not your private parts. Your feelings. Today is a bit on the mushy side as gentle Venus sidles up next to chatty Mercury in the heavens. Don’t be afraid to express yourself.

"
16 october 2018,aries,"Anyone who has been underestimating you is in for a big surprise. You’re becoming more determined every day, thanks to transformational Pluto in a powerful position. But don’t beat people over the head with your newfound attitude; let them find out slowly what’s going on!

"
17 october 2018,aries,"The Moon in Aquarius should put you in quite the social mood. The next four days are excellent for networking. But be selective about the people you hang out with and what you share; you don’t want your private business splashed all over social media.

"
22 october 2018,aries,"Jealousy has no place in your life right now. As a matter of fact you should be feeling optimistic and ready to enjoy abundance. But the cosmos isn’t going to dump goodies right into your lap. If you’re willing to work for the beautiful things in life, they’re yours for the having.

"
27 october 2018,aries,"Do what you have to do to impress muckety mucks today. You may think that your talents are on view for everyone to see already. But people are busy, and they don’t notice everything. It’s time for a little self-promotion.

"

What matters is that you express yourself.

"
30 october 2018,aries,"Don’t underestimate the power of feeling comfortable in your own skin. If something is troubling you, you need to get to the root of it, now. Otherwise you’ll be going through your days weighed down by too much personal baggage.

"
31 october 2018,aries,"Conflicting planetary aspects make you crave freedom and desire security at the same time!

"
6 november 2018,aries,"It’s ba-a-a-ack!!! Eccentric Uranus retrogrades into your sign today, a place it hasn’t been since May. Unfinished business from the early part of 2018 will come back, demanding to be resolved. If you’re smart you’ll take care of things quickly. When Jupiter enters your house of adventure this Thursday, you won’t want to waste time on trivial matters.

"
7 november 2018,aries,"You have to spend money to make it. You also have to put in time if you want to get something of value. Relationships are a two way street.

"

"

"
20 november 2018,aries,"With energetic Uranus sizzling in your sign, you should be feeling feisty. Chances are you’re not going to want to feel tied down to any particular situation, preferring to go with the flow. And why not? Playing by the rules all the time gets mighty dull.

"
23 november 2018,aries,"You’re probably feeling bolder than you have in a long time. Now that the Sun is in the most optimistic part of your chart, you’ll be willing to take chances that other people wouldn’t dream of. Don’t listen to them if they tell you that it can’t be done. It can be, and you’re just the person to pull it off.

"
24 november 2018,aries,"Now that Neptune is direct in the house of the subconscious mind, clarity should slowly start to seep back into that brain of yours. Good timing, too. Other planets are pushing you to try new things. You need a clear vision as to what you’re going to do next.

"
26 november 2018,aries,"Woo-hoo!!!! Today is one of the best days in 2018. The annual meeting of the Sun and Jupiter takes place in the most adventurous part of your chart. Over the next year you can break down barriers and achieve things that will even surprise you. But Mars is in a tough spot from your confidentiality sector, suggesting that you keep some things quiet.

"
27 november 2018,aries,"If there was ever a time to break out of a dead-end job, this is it. Magnificent planetary aspects are encouraging you to take a risk. Side hustles, entrepreneurship, switching to a new field, writing a book, changing companies—all of these are favored in a big way. By this time next year your current gig could be a distant memory.

"
28 november 2018,aries,"You’re stepping into a powerful place, and no one will be able to stop you! But that doesn’t mean that you need to rub everyone’s noses in it. Actually, your best bet is to be a silent force. High octane Mars happens to be in the most secretive, confidential part of your chart.

"
1 december 2018,aries,"How deep is your love? And how deep is your bank account? Intelligent Mercury retrogrades into the house that governs net worth and intimacy today. This is a short period, ending on December 6th. But if you’re smart you will use it wisely.

"
3 december 2018,aries,"Your opinion is valuable, perhaps much more so than you realize. That’s why you need to be careful with whom you share information. . The dream stealers are out there today and later in the week. Don’t give away precious intel.

"
4 december 2018,aries,"Emotional issues from the past can get straightened out today. But first you have to realize that it’s not your karma to suffer. Are you truly ready to heal? Once Mercury goes direct on Thursday, you should feel much more comfortable in your own skin.

"
5 december 2018,aries,"Your intuition could be off today, so don’t count on it being accurate. Stick with the facts instead. People could be running around spouting some high falutin’ ideas, so take everything you hear with a grain of salt.

"
6 december 2018,aries,"Yee-ha! Mercury goes direct in your house net worth and intimacy. Between now and next Wednesday, you should do everything in your power to straighten out your romance and financial situation. Get it over and done with and then enjoy the holiday season.

"
7 december 2018,aries,"The new moon falls in your house of adventure, setting the stage for an exciting year ahead in 2019. But your brain could be bubbling over with fears and concerns, many of which are unfounded. Stop worrying about what other people think. Do your own thing!

"
8 december 2018,aries,"It’s time to stop playing it so safe, archer. Your sign isn’t known for holding back, but lately you may have been a little too conservative. It’s time to be fearless again. Don’t worry–with mature Saturn by your side, you shouldn’t do anything too off the wall!

"
9 december 2018,aries,"There’s no point in holding a grudge. The only person it will hurt is you. So say what you have to say and don’t look back. You’ll feel a lot better for it in the end.

"
10 december 2018,aries,"They say that timing is everything. The Moon is now in the most ambitious part of your chart, so success could be coming your way. Naturally you’ve worked hard for it, but a little help from the cosmos is always a good thing!

"
11 december 2018,aries,"You may be raring to go thanks to high octane Uranus in your sign. But you’re not a bottomless pit of energy, so don’t push it too hard! Slow down too with romantic and financial matters. You need more time to think things through.

"
12 december 2018,aries,"Ready to have your mind opened up wide? Mercury zips into your house of big picture thinking today, making you aware of possibilities that you may not have considered before. 2019 is almost here: what audacious dreams should you go after?

"
13 december 2018,aries,"You may feel unstoppable (and maybe you are) but today is not a good time to push too hard. You run a risk–of burning out, offending people with delicate egos or overlooking key details. Pull back, at least for 24 hours.

"
14 december 2018,aries,"Your intuition hits new levels thanks to a Moon-Mars meet-up in the most vibey part of your chart. Act like a sponge and soak up as much info as you can from your surroundings. Knowledge is power!

"
18 december 2018,aries,"You could do something audacious today, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that! The passionate Moon meets up with unpredictable Uranus. It’s as if the cosmos is giving you its permission to let your freak flag fly. Go ahead, be daring.

"
19 december 2018,aries,"Getting motivated is a heck of a lot easier with the Sun in the most energetic part of your chart. That said, there may be things that you simply don’t feel like doing. Knock them out today, because tomorrow’s aspects are perfect for playtime.

"
20 december 2018,aries,"You might do something unexpected today, but this is a good thing! The cosmos is pushing you to take more chances, even if you are  one of the most adventurous signs of the zodiac. Even if an idea seems all-out crazy, it may have substance, so don’t ignore it.

"
28 december 2018,aries,"Something to happen over the next week that could increase your status immensely. But this doesn’t mean that you should swagger about. On the contrary. Keep things low key. You’ll attract even more attention by remaining humble.

"
29 december 2018,aries,"The past few weeks may not have been easy. Mars has been touring your house of the subconscious mind, stirring up the waters. The red planet is getting ready to leave on New Year’s Eve. But today it forms a fabulous aspect with Chiron, the wounded healer. Let go of all of the mental chunk that has been holding you back.

"
30 december 2018,aries,"You may have reached your limit with a certain situation or person. If that’s the case, I wish them a lot of luck! Once Mars enters your sign tomorrow, you’ll be leaving a lot of things—and people– behind you in the dust.

"
8 march 2018,taurus,"What exactly do you need from a romantic partnership, Taurus? Jupiter starts to retrograde today in your commitment sector, which also deals with business alliances. Over the next four months you can mull this over. Jupiter is a philosophical planet, prone to deep thought. It’s generous and abundant too, so think about how to truly enjoy your personal or professional life with another person.

"
9 march 2018,taurus,"Are you putting enough money aside for the future, Taurus? Heaven knows that you love the finer things in life, but you can’t be indulging in them without a thought for “rainy days” ahead. Stop emotional spending and just buy the basics.

"

"
11 march 2018,taurus,"Projects or plans could go off the rails as people slack or refuse to follow the rules. It may be hard to figure out the next step, which could also be part of the problem. Clarity returns tomorrow, so wait 24 hours before making key decisions.

"
14 march 2018,taurus,"Avoid petty arguments today, as they simply aren’t worth it. With the Moon in the most authoritative (read: “bossy”) part of your chart you may be itching to point out someone’s failings. Let it go. Tomorrow is a much better time to get back in agreement with people.

"
15 march 2018,taurus,"Group activities are going to pick up steam in the months ahead, and you may be on the verge of meeting some exciting new people to team up with. From your chart it’s clear that you need to be around movers and shakers, not people whose thinking is still in the 1980s.

"
16 march 2018,taurus,"Your creativity is off the charts with a Moon-Neptune meet-up. If you’re part of a team effort, share your insight with the group as your input is worthwhile. Working solo? Then you might want to run your ideas past a trusted friend or mentor.

"
17 march 2018,taurus,"One of the most visionary periods in years opens up for you today, Taurus. First, there will be a new moon in the sector that deals with networking and team efforts.

"
18 march 2018,taurus,"Who needs critics or frenemies? Not you, Taurus, so don’t put up with it. Your intuition is spot on these days, so if you doubt someone’s loyalty or agenda, chances are you’re on target.

"
20 march 2018,taurus,"The Sun enters the most secretive part of your chart today, and this year the energy is more hush-hush than usual.

"
21 march 2018,taurus,"You need to recharge your batteries, Taurus. From your chart it appears that you’ve been pushing yourself too hard.

"
22 march 2018,taurus,"Fire up the old BS meter. Over the next few weeks you may be dealing with people who have hidden agendas, people who might want to work at cross purposes to you. Mercury is now retrograde in the house of secrets and your intuition may be off. Don’t forget–you possess a very logical left brain.

"
23 march 2018,taurus,"You’re in a dreamy state of mind, but this could lead to illogical thinking. Keep it real, Taurus. Your sign is known for being level headed but you run the risk of getting flattered or even conned by someone.

This vibe will be in play all week, so get used to it! Remember that it’s their problem, not yours. Things get better on Saturday when Venus enters your sign.

"
27 march 2018,taurus,"Your sign is famous for being sturdy and dependable, but that doesn’t mean that you have to take on everyone’s problems. If this is a role that you feel is karmic, or that you’re the only one who can do it, then get over yourself. It’s time to let others figure things out for themselves.

"
29 march 2018,taurus,"Appearances can be deceiving, Taurus. In your optimism don’t assume that everyone has your back or shares your dreams. This means that you need to watch how much intel you reveal. Wait a few days for better cosmic energy.

"
30 march 2018,taurus,"You’ve been a good friend and confidante to other people, but are you being treated the same way in return? Make sure that you’re not carrying too much of a burden by being that good friend. Surround yourself by people who support you.

"
31 march 2018,taurus,"Adventure meets up with practicality at the time of today’s full moon. Wrap up unfinished projects at home and at work. Then get ready to take some risks, pushing past your old ideas of what you’re capable of. Venus enters your sign today too: perfect time for a makeover!

"
1 april 2018,taurus,"Both the right and left sides of your brain are crushing it today, Taurus! So let your creativity rip along with practicality and wisdom. It’s a smart time to tuck yourself away and do some thinking, if only for an hour or two.

"
2 april 2018,taurus,"How much should you reveal? Impatient Mars wants you to get it all out there, while mature Saturn tells you to parse your words. Stay on the smart side and just say what is necessary, nothing more.

"
3 april 2018,taurus,"It’s time to partner up with people who share your ideas and talent level, Taurus. Sure, you can try to go it alone but you’ll enjoy the journey more if you have company along the way.

"
4 april 2018,taurus,"Red hot Mars is making you more adventurous than usual, but this may not be beneficial! Problem is, Mercury is off key in your house of intuition. If your gut is telling you to do something, you should give it a few days first. Make sure to use the logical side of your mind too.

"
5 april 2018,taurus,"Both your physical and mental energy may be taking a hit this week, so it’s imperative to chill out and relax. Otherwise you’re looking at major burnout! Don’t worry, all of your projects can wait a few days.

"
6 april 2018,taurus,"You have an independent streak a mile wide but at some point you need to ask for help. Today’s a good time to start. You might discover, to your surprise, that someone is supporting you from behind the scenes. By all means let them help you.

"
7 april 2018,taurus,"You can plan all you want but at some point ya just gotta get some sh** done, Taurus. Today’s an excellent time to swing into action. Wise old Saturn has your back, preventing you from doing anything too stupid. Get some momentum going.

"
8 april 2018,taurus,"The pieces of a plan or project will start to come together this week, and if you’re smart you’ll get other people involved if you haven’t already. Just make sure that you know where they’re coming from. Do they truly have your best interest at heart, or their’s?

"
9 april 2018,taurus,"Venus is in your sign, pushing you to boost your confidence with a little makeover magic. But the Moon may make you question whether it’s worth the trouble. It is, so stop sulking and get on with it!

"
10 april 2018,taurus,"With the moon in the most sensitive part of your chart you could be feeling quite emo! Furthermore people could be talking out of both sides of their mouth. Listen to what they say but don’t make any major decisions right now.

"
11 april 2018,taurus,"Someone has the gift of gab and they may use it to try to flatter you into getting what they want. But yo’ mama didn’t raise no fool, so smile sweetly and glide casually to the nearest exit.

"
12 april 2018,taurus,"Luscious Venus is currently transiting your sign, amping up your charisma. So don’t be surprised if you’re attracting admirers and people who want a little of that magic to rub off on them! But if you’re still feeling down on yourself despite this energy, then consider a makeover. It’s the best time in 2018 to go for it.

"
13 april 2018,taurus,"The new few years of your life could be quite adventurous, if you let it be! An optimistic Jupiter-Pluto aspect suggests that you surround yourself with people who have the vision to see things that others can’t, folks who aren’t afraid of putting themselves out there.

"
14 april 2018,taurus,"Sometimes we get so beaten down by the daily grind that it’s hard to think on a lofty level. But you’ll be able to do that today, as Mars and Neptune are both active in the most visionary parts of your chart. That view from 30,000 feet can be quite illuminating.

"
15 april 2018,taurus,"The next 48 hours are probably the best time in 2018 to toss things (or people!) that are no longer working for you, Taurus. Mercury has been retrograding through your house of endings for the last three weeks, making you more aware that closure is necessary. It moves direct today, so start taking out the trash.

"
16 april 2018,taurus,"The long dark night of the soul is coming to an end, Taurus. For the past seven years you’ve experienced rebellious Uranus transiting through the house of your subconscious mind. Most likely it stirred up all sorts of childhood memories and not-so-pleasant ones of romances gone sour. Uranus will be leaving this sector on May 15th, but you can put an end to the drama right now with today’s new moon in the house of closure and transition.

"
17 april 2018,taurus,"Big plans may get put on hold as Saturn retrogrades in your house of travel, education, entrepreneurship and taking risks. Or maybe you simply need to go back and revisit your MO. Over the next few months make sure that everything you put out there is perfect: marketing materials, your resume, a college application, thesis, art portfolio, business plan, product design, you name it.

"
18 april 2018,taurus,"Sometimes healing ourselves emotionally can take years (on a therapists’s couch, no less). But at other times change can happen in a flash, and today is one of them. A brilliant Sun-Uranus connection helps you realize disempowering thoughts (and get rid of them) in a heartbeat.

"
19 april 2018,taurus,"Adventure is calling your name, Taurus, so why not put yourself out there and take a smart risk? Life’s too short to be stuck in a familiar old groove, no mater how comfortable it might be. This may require changing the image you have of yourself first, but change will do you good.

"
20 april 2018,taurus,"It’s showtime! Happy birthday, Taurus. This year won’t be like any you’ve experienced before in your lifetime. Brilliant, eccentric Uranus glides into your sign on May 15th, a place it hasn’t been since 1942. Over the next eight years you can completely reinvent your life and experience moments of sheer genius. Ready for a revolution?

"
21 april 2018,taurus,"Red hot Mars is riling you up, pushing you to go after some pretty wild dreams. Which is fine, so long as you don’t burn yourself out in the process. You also run the risk of over promising and not being able to deliver, something that could cause you to lose face. Slow down and do things right.

"
22 april 2018,taurus,"A phoenix rising from the ashes. That’s the image you should keep in mind about yourself, Taurus. Subterranean Pluto goes retrograde in your house of taking risks, challenging you to break away from an old self-image that doesn’t suit you anymore. This may mean “setting fire” to the past, but how else are you going to be transformed?

"
23 april 2018,taurus,"Got a case of wanderlust? The planets are pulling you toward the airport. Distant lands are calling your name. But before you can take off into the great blue yonder, you may need to take care of things at home. Do that and then start trawling the travel blogs.

"
24 april 2018,taurus,"Feel like splurging on yourself? That’s a ridiculous question to ask a Taurus! Of course you do. Now you have the cosmos’s permission to do so—Venus just entered your house of spending and luxury. Don’t go crazy and don’t go broke, but make sure that you get a nice treat (or two).

"
25 april 2018,taurus,"Lofty thinking is usually a good thing, provided that it’s offset by careful planning. But today you may be too impatient to get things off the ground. Another issue is that your intuition appears to be off, all the more reason to slow down.

"
26 april 2018,taurus,"Feel like things are starting to move at warp speed in your life? Or are you trying hard to push things along so that momentum increases? Red hot Mars meets up with power broker Pluto, demanding that things be done, and “I wanted them yesterday.” Whether this is a smart move or not is another issue. Be wary of trying to reach a destination too quickly; it might backfire.

"
27 april 2018,taurus,"This is not a good time to play games or do something behind the backs of other people, Taurus. You might also be keeping information from someone in an attempt to protect them or not upset them. Trust me, they’ll be even more upset if they find out that you held back. No good deed goes unpunished, right?

"
28 april 2018,taurus,"Just because someone has a crazy ass idea doesn’t mean that you need to buy into it! Likewise, no matter how brilliant you may think your ideas are, others may not see it that way. But that shouldn’t stop you from pursuing grand schemes. Just don’t count on others to participate.

"
29 april 2018,taurus,"You’re in an excellent spot to take a smart risk, something that has long lasting consequences. Consider who might be able to help you along the way— a mentor, friend, lover, relative or business connection. This is one of your best years in a decade to partner up with others. Don’t feel that you have to go it alone.

"
30 april 2018,taurus,"A sizzling full moon occurs in your commitment zone, and this is good news for love! Singles, over the next two weeks you could meet a series suitor. Both online dating sites and networking face to face at get togethers could pay off handsomely. Coupled up bulls should be planning a romantic vacation with lusty Mars active in your travel zone.

"
1 may 2018,taurus,"The planets are pushing you to be more of a team player:  in romance, your family life and at the office. But there’s a hint of rebellion coming from your subconscious mind. You need to ask yourself if this desire to pull away is based on something real and logical, or if it’s just ego and emotions that are pushing your buttons.

"
2 may 2018,taurus,"You’re a rock solid soul, not known for getting thrown off balance easily. But you can be bull-headed from time to time, and today is one of those days! This is a tendency you’re going to have to watch over the next two weeks. The 7th, 8th and 12th all have this energy, so make sure that you don’t offend the wrong people.

"
3 may 2018,taurus,"You’re about to enter one of the most fast-paced, transformational periods of your life come mid-May. Now is a good time to consider which risks you’d like to take over the next eight years! The good news is that you won’t be going in where angels fear to tread. Your choices will be smart ones, a bit daring but still logical.

"
4 may 2018,taurus,"There are people who say that rules are meant to be broken, but is that really the case? Your sign is usually pretty settled on following a particular path, but over the next few weeks you may be questioning some of the rules that have been running your life.

"
5 may 2018,taurus,"Is there something that you’ve been dreaming about doing for years? And for some reason, you never felt like you had the chops to go after it? Powerful Pluto is telling you to man up (or woman up!) and go for it. You have a lot more going for you than you realize.

"
6 may 2018,taurus,"Some interesting new contacts could come your way, so don’t lock yourself at home today! It’s a great time to join a club or volunteer effort. Friends could play matchmaker. New BFFs are out there, just looking for someone to party with. What are you waiting for?

"
7 may 2018,taurus,"Getting to the bottom of things could be mighty difficult with today’s confusing planetary aspects. People could resort to flattery, arm twisting or passive aggressive behavior. With the Sun in your sign you may be tempted to run them over, but hold back.

"
8 may 2018,taurus,"It’s critical to make sure that you and a partner (romantic or otherwise) are on the same page. Jupiter, planet of abundance and optimism, is hitting you with a heavy dose of unrealistic thinking. With next week’s new moon in your sign, you need to get clear about whether or not the people in your orbit share your views and plans.

"
9 may 2018,taurus,"Pull people into your plans, Taurus. You’re in one of the most productive, free-thinking periods of your life, able to move mountains with your thoughts and words. A terrific lunar aspect today suggests that you seek the wisdom of others…or take them along for the ride!

"
10 may 2018,taurus,"Hmmm….does that “platonic” friend or business contact want to be more than that? Could be with a romantic Moon-Neptune connection! Unless you’re ready to go down that path, you need to keep things professional.

"
11 may 2018,taurus,"You may have been holding back when it comes to taking risks, Taurus. That’s about to change big time thanks to dynamic Pluto getting rid of your fear factor. Don’t worry, you won’t do anything stupid. Logical Saturn has your back. If in doubt, run ideas past a mentor.

"
12 may 2018,taurus,"Your calculations about how long it will take something to get done seem to be way  off, Taurus! The same holds true for how expensive it will be, the amount of risk involved and the final expected outcome. Fortunately shrewd Mercury enters your sign tomorrow, bringing some much needed clarity.

"
13 may 2018,taurus,"Chatty Mercury is now in Taurus, making it far easier to get your point across. Run ideas past people and open up the lines of communication. This is not time to be shy about your desires or plans. You’ve been in the shadows for too long.

"
14 may 2018,taurus,"Out with the old, in with the new! Today is like the mother of all New Year’s Eve parties, Taurus. Uranus enters your sign tomorrow, a major life event. But before it goes it makes one last sweep through your psyche, decluttering mental debris and encouraging you to toss old baggage.

"
15 may 2018,taurus,"The spotlight is on you, Taurus! Uranus is now in your sign for the first time since 1942. Over the next eight years your self-image, goals and attitude will do a complete 180. There will be periods of intense activity and progress followed by slow times, so pace yourself.

"
16 may 2018,taurus,"Make a wish and blow out the birthday candles, Taurus! Your annual new moon just occurred, and this is the best time in 2018 to refine your wishes for the year ahead—and then go after them. Tomorrow Mars enters your goals sector, so nothing—and I mean nothing—is going to stop you.

"
17 may 2018,taurus,"Wild card Uranus has been in your sign for only 48 hours and it’s already shaking things up! Today you might feel like rebelling—against the system, a boss or someone whom you feel is holding you back. Watch your tongue for now! Once diplomatic Venus flies into your communication sector on Saturday, you’ll be able to get your point across.

"
18 may 2018,taurus,"Your sign is known for being steadfast to the point of being cautious. And today a superb Mercury-Saturn trine enables you to put yourself out there, taking a risk, without compromising too much. Logical Saturn will help you move forward without doing something stupid!

"
19 may 2018,taurus,"Spread your wings, social butterfly! Venus enters your house of networking, so be prepared to party. That’s no problem for your luxe-loving sign. The next three weeks are also super for a personal makeover, as Uranus, the planet of change, high-fives Venus today too. Go and get your glam on.

"
20 may 2018,taurus,"One of the most prosperous times of 2018 begins today thanks to the Sun entering your house of income and security. Use the next four weeks to promote yourself as strongly as you can. Venus is now in your house of self-expression and promotion, helping to advertise your brand and show off your talents.

"
21 may 2018,taurus,"You may be a stubborn creature of habit but the cosmos is telling you to switch things up a bit! Specifically, the planets are telling you to plan some exciting vacations to far off destinations. This has an extra benefit, other than the standard rest and relaxation. The more you’re exposed to different cultures and fresh ideas, the faster your mind will grow.

"
22 may 2018,taurus,"No man or woman is an island and you can truly benefit by allowing new people into your inner circle. You might end up being surprised at how these connections will expand your mind and add more “juice” in your life.

"
23 may 2018,taurus,"Close relationships need to be handled with rational thinking, not the wishful kind. A Mercury-Jupiter opposition could make either you or someone else unrealistic about where things are heading. This is true in business as well as love, so keep it real in all areas of your life.

"
24 may 2018,taurus,"With aggressive Mars blazing a path through your ambition sector, you are a force of nature these days! The red planet forms a trine, the best possible angle in astrology, with the fiery Sun. Don’t hold back— be courageous—and ask for what you want. If the door is closed, then kick open another one.

"
25 may 2018,taurus,"A rare Jupiter-Neptune trine sets the stage for meeting new people, developing relationships that can take you to exciting places in your life. The smartest thing that you can do is to get out there and connect face to face, and be open to people with different philosophies and backgrounds.

"
26 may 2018,taurus,"Your rock-solid sign sometimes needs some prodding to take a risk, and that’s what the cosmos is telling you to do today! A stellar Mercury-Pluto trine is opening your mind to fresh possibilities. Pluto is the planet that governs our personal awareness and power, and it’s helping you change your perspective about what’s possible.

"
27 may 2018,taurus,"Someone may be unusually critical today, so don’t be too thin skinned. This person may be a stickler for following the rules, or they live in a world where they’re afraid of taking chances. Remember that that’s their problem, not your’s.

"
28 may 2018,taurus,"Protecting your emotional “territory” could be an issue with a tense Moon-Mercury opposition. The full moon tomorrow takes place in one of the sectors that deals with feelings and psychological issues, so this isn’t entirely surprising! But before you vent and say things you may regret, hold back a bit.

"
29 may 2018,taurus,"Unless your name is Oprah, you’re undoubtedly looking to build up your net worth. Then you’ll love tonight’s full moon in the “big money” part of your chart. It’s time to close out a period of your life when money was tight and step into one that has a lot more abundance going on! Mercury pops into your income sector, telling you to start building wealth by earning and saving more.

"
30 may 2018,taurus,"Listen to your own wisdom today, especially if someone seems to be promising you the Moon and the stars. You know what they say: if something sounds too good to be true it probably is. Follow your own path instead.

"
31 may 2018,taurus,"Sometimes when we need clarity we need to (metaphorically) go up to the “mountaintop” for a better view. A productive Moon-Saturn aspect will help clear out difficult emotions and help you see things for what they really are.

"
1 june 2018,taurus,"Need to make a big ask? Then today’s the time to do it! Verbal Mercury is perfectly aspected with dynamic Mars in your house of achievement. It’s also a primo time to go on interviews, make presentations or research new income streams.

"
2 june 2018,taurus,"If making a difference in the world is important to you, then now is the time to start giving. A wonderful Venus-Neptune aspect will help you get in touch with your philanthropic side. Pick a cause near and dear to your heart and dive in. You’ll end up meeting like minded people who could be your friends for life.

"
3 june 2018,taurus,"Right now you need to look out for #1, Taurus. A powerful Moon-Mars aspect ignites your motivation to chase after the things that are most important to you, not others. Don’t feel guilty about it either! Each one of us is responsible for our own destinty.

"
4 june 2018,taurus,"People around you may be unreliable this week, but that’s not going to slow down your momentum. A helpful Mercury-Sun aspect enables you to come up with a Plan B if others slack off or somehow throw up roadblocks. Make sure that your own personal habits are spot on too.

"
5 june 2018,taurus,"Doing things the easy way might be comfortable, but it doesn’t necessarily get results. Your brain could use a good workout, so let it rip! Naturally this may stir up fears or insecurities, but you’ll be able to work through them.

"
6 june 2018,taurus,"Someone may be difficult to read over the next few days, and it could be frustrating at your end to suss what’s going on. It could be anything from confusion to downright deception on their part. Don’t jump to conclusions; what until next Tuesday to get a handle on the issue.

"
7 june 2018,taurus,"Crack the whip? That’s what you may have to do with people around you who are slacking off. This could be really apparent in group situations. Be prepared for whining, excuses and hidden agendas. The good news is that the illuminating Sun is in a highly practical location for you, so you’ll be able to sniff out what’s going on.

"
8 june 2018,taurus,"You may feel like pulling away from the crazy world this weekend, thanks to the Moon in the most secluded part of your chart. Taking risks isn’t going to be appealing, so get cozy and relax chez vous. Or head to your favorite cafe, a place that might feel like a second home.

"
9 june 2018,taurus,"People may be full of weird ideas that they’s like you to go along with, but that doesn’t mean that you have to! You are an individual with your own opinions and plans. Start listening to your own heart and wisdom.

"
10 june 2018,taurus,"Sometimes ya just gotta look out for #1 and that’s what you should do over the next two days! Wednesday’s new moon is in the most security-seeking part of your chart, so do what has to be done to get what you need. Legally, of course!

12 june 2018,taurus,"Mercury heads into your house of self-expression, making the next few weeks some of the best all year to toot your horn! Tomorrow could bring an unexpected opportunity to make a pitch, meet someone new or come up with a genius idea. Remain alert and be ready to take advantage of what pops up.

"
13 june 2018,taurus,"Bulls are famous for being down to earth, but today’s planetary activity encourages you to be even more grounded. The new moon occurs in your house of routines and developing a sound financial base. Then Venus glides into your sector of emotional stability, family and home. Shaky situations have to go, to be replaced by those that will stand the test of time.

"
14 june 2018,taurus,"Your moods could go all over the place, making you feel discombobulated. Not to mention that other people will be totally confused! It could be that you have people in your life that aren’t the right fit for you. When Neptune retrogrades next week you’ll have the chance to reexamine your closest alliances.

"
15 june 2018,taurus,"Saturn, planet of the long term, is in a tight spot today. You may need to sign a contract or agree to something, but avoid it if you can. The terms may not be to your liking, or the plan may not be well thought out. Give yourself till next Wednesday to think things over and make a final decision.

"
16 june 2018,taurus,"The summer solstice arrives next week and it falls in the most social part of your chart! Spontaneous Uranus is active in your sign, encouraging you to get out there and meet as many new people as possible. There’s nothing wrong with your existing tribe but you could stand to meet some people with different views and experience.

"
17 june 2018,taurus,"Your sign is known for being so sturdy, so steady. As a result you may be keeping your emotions in check but it’s time to let them flow. This is especially true when it comes to friends and loved ones…let them know how you feel!

"
18 june 2018,taurus,"Who’s on Team Taurus? That’s going to be the question over the next few months as Neptune retrogrades in your house of friends and team members. If you doubt anyone’s allegiance, consider if they should remain in your life. But people from your past could return, and you’ll be able to rekindle old friendships.

"
19 june 2018,taurus,"You’ve got the gift of gab so use it to your advantage! A stellar Mercury-Jupiter meet-up is just the ticket for self-expression. People will be more than willing to listen; they could also be considering going the distance with you, which includes love!

"
20 june 2018,taurus,"Most of us use technology to support our work or to communicate with loved ones. And today inspirational Neptune is in a fabulous spot in the tech sector. This is a smart time to promote your brand on social media, launch a sales funnel, develop a site, or to just let someone know how much you care.

"
21 june 2018,taurus,"The summer solstice plants the Sun firmly in your vivacious house of socializing, but there’s some tension in the air. Venus and Mars are at odds with each other, spoiling the fun mood a bit. A love relationship could be going through growing pains: one of you may be more ready than the other, causing long term plans to be fuzzy. Don’t sweat it; once Mercury changes signs on the 29th you’ll be able to talk things over more productively.

"
22 june 2018,taurus,"A Sun-Uranus aspect puts you in a spunky mood, ready for anything. Socializing is highly favored, so be ready to get out there and mingle today. The next few weeks are auspicious for networking but not committing to a new plan of action.

"
23 june 2018,taurus,"Someone may try to put the kibosh on a plan of yours, and they could be quite cranky about it. It’s also possible that you need to conduct more research before diving into something. Otherwise you might make some mistakes, annoying a power player in the process. Slow down and don’t try to force things to happen before their time.

"
24 june 2018,taurus,"Sometimes the best way to get what you want is to let them flow in, rather than holding on tightly and making demands. This isn’t manifesting as in The Secret; it’s about being optimistic and letting things take their course after you’ve put in the effort.

"
25 june 2018,taurus,"Sometimes you just have to do what other people are interested in or follow their game plan. I now, I know, some of these people have their heads up their butts, but what can you do? Let them find out the hard way that they’re off base.

"
26 june 2018,taurus,"You don’t like taking “no” for an answer, but over the next two months you may have to deal with just that. Mars is now retrograde in the ambition sector, putting the brakes on  big personal initiatives. But don’t assume that the slowdown means that you’ll never get what you want; it may just take a bit longer than you’d like!

"
27 june 2018,taurus,"If you feel as though things are spiraling out of control, as though they’re going too fast and you can’t keep up, blame it on a Sun-Saturn opposition. This is not a time to over promise or to take on too many obligations; as a matter of fact you should probably cut back on a few.

"
28 june 2018,taurus,"Your next move is a crucial one, Taurus. Tonight’s full moon occurs in the most adventurous, optimistic part of your chart. But you run the risk of diving into too many projects without giving them enough thought. Slow down and consider your options carefully.

29 june 2018,taurus,"Now that Mercury is in one of the most sensitive parts of your chart, it’s time to talk openly with loved ones. The good news is that you should be feeling brave, thanks to the full moon yesterday in your house of optimism and forward thinking.

"
30 june 2018,taurus,"Erratic Uranus is acting up in your sign, perhaps making you moody or unpredictable. Watch your words, bull, because you could easily offend someone close without meaning to.

"
1 july 2018,taurus,"Big ideas and plans that may have been put on the back burner can come back to life, Taurus. Planetary energy over the next week is superb for slowly getting back into them without taking undue risk.

"
2 july 2018,taurus,"You may have to give up something that you’ve become attached to, but this really isn’t going to be a problem! Growth and personal development puts us in a place where we realize that we don’t need to hang on to certain values, dreams, people or situations. Onward and upward!

"
3 july 2018,taurus,"Everyone around you may be full of advice, but this is not a bad thing! Pay attention to what they have to say, and accept offers of help. You never know where things might lead.

"
4 july 2018,taurus,"Trying to choose between your emotions and the advice that others are giving you could be difficult. Both may be accurate, so give yourself time to sort things out. Friends could act as a terrific sounding board for you, by the way.

"
5 july 2018,taurus,"Relationship issues can be more easily resolved if you distance yourself from them. This doesn’t mean that you should cut people off. Rather, step aside and be more objective as you analyze the situation. A super solar aspect enables you to take that 30,000 foot view.

"
6 july 2018,taurus,"You can’t please everyone, Taurus, something that may become apparent today. Despite how badly you want to keep the peace, others may be hell bent on stirring up trouble, or going on head trips.Pull away if you can and wait til the early part of next week, a much better time.

"
7 july 2018,taurus,"Unpredictable Uranus is going to light a fire under you today to do things very  differently, and this is a good thing! It’s about time that you busted out of a rut. Find a mentor who can guide you into a much more rewarding future.

"
8 july 2018,taurus,"Speak passionately about what you believe in, Aries! Your words will hit the mark. These could be tender sweet little nothings whispered to a lover, or powerful statements made in the boardroom. Your ability to bond with others skyrockets with a positive Sun-Neptune connection.

"
9 july 2018,taurus,"Yes! Love planet Venus is now in your house of romance. Can it get any better? Yup. Jupiter resumes direct motion in your house of commitment tomorrow. Your love life is heating up, so get ready to enjoy it!

This is especially true of your romantic life, and the good news is that Jupiter goes direct today in that part of your chart. If you’re in a committed relationship, you’ll be able to make progress as optimism returns. Singles, your ability to find a keeper skyrockets especially as of the solar eclipse on Friday.

"
11 july 2018,taurus,"A sudden urge may strike you to toss out your old look and attitude and replace them with something new. Uranus is active in your sign, telling you to ramp up your sex appeal and charisma. This doesn’t mean that there is anything wrong with you the way you are now. But if you want to add more sizzle to your step, it’s time for a makeover.

"
12 july 2018,taurus,"You may be aiming for the stars, but someone out there maybe determined to keep your feet on the ground. A Sun-Pluto opposition indicates that there could be resistance to your plans. But this is not necessarily a bad thing. From your chart, it appears that you need to do more research before you move forward.

"
13 july 2018,taurus,"Is it time to go loud and proud? Today’s solar eclipse in your communication sector could prompt you to blab everything to the world. The next six months are super for blogging, writing a book, public speaking, networking and strategizing with other people. But the cosmos has a warning: don’t say too much too soon. Make sure that everything you put out there is polished to perfection.

"
14 july 2018,taurus,"Ready to take some chances in love? If so, the cosmos has your back. These aren’t the kind of crazy chances that will find you holding a short end of the stick. No, this is about taking smart risks that will enhance your love life.

"
16 july 2018,taurus,"You’re famous for being a sensual sign and you love romance. And you’re going to love today’s Moon-Venus connection! It’s a great date night for those bulls who are already attached, and singles should be out on the hunt.

"
17 july 2018,taurus,"If you’re getting set up with constantly compromising, you can blame it on a tense lunar aspect today. But this is actually a good thing, as the Moon is trying to make you wake up and smell the coffee. Trying to please people and fit in with the crowd just seems like a waste of time these days. Who needs the agita?

"
18 july 2018,taurus,"You have some pretty ambitious thoughts running through your head. That’s nice, of course, but they’re not worth a damn if you don’t do anything with them. With the Moon in the most productive part of your chart, you’ll be motivated to take some action.

"
19 july 2018,taurus,"You could be feeling quite independent today, thanks to spontaneous Uranus acting up in your sign. The problem is, this may not go over well with people who are close to you. You run the risk of asking too much like a… stubborn bull! Lighten up a little.

"
20 july 2018,taurus,"You’re a proud bull and you like making your own decisions. But cosmic activity in your chart recommends seeking advice from others right now. Friends, colleagues and mentors can provide you with incredible inspiration.

"
21 july 2018,taurus,"With loving Venus in your house of romance, and lucky Jupiter in your house of commitment, you can’t go wrong today.

"
23 july 2018,taurus,"People could be sending you mixed signals, Taurus. And your nerves could be getting a little bit fried because of it.

The lunar eclipse arriving on Friday will put you in the driver’s seat, at which time you can get straight answers.

"
24 july 2018,taurus,"Follow your own wisdom, Taurus. Don’t listen to others who say that something can be done. The reality is that they may be jealous of your ambition. Keep charging forward and don’t look back.

"
25 july 2018,taurus,"Feel like staging a rebellion? It’s quite possible with hotheaded Uranus swinging into action in your sign. Anyone who is threatening your security or your emotional sense of contentment is fair game. Just make sure that you can afford to tell them off!

"
26 july 2018,taurus,"Nobody can push your buttons like family, right? And now that Mercury is retrograde in your domestic sector, you can expect plenty of drama coming from your relatives. That is, of course, you take the bull by the horns (ha-ha!) and resolve issues before they turn into raging fires.

"
28 july 2018,taurus,"Surround yourself with creative people who know how to enjoy life, Taurus. Life is too short to spend time with people who are always down in the dumps. The cosmos is pushing you to make some new connections. Look for people who are thinkers, travelers and who have an independent spirit.

"
29 july 2018,taurus,"Who’s the boss? People could be in a domineering mood today, throwing their weight around. You can try to talk sense to them but you’ll be wasting your time. Save your energy for more important and rewarding pursuits.

"
30 july 2018,taurus,"Compromises can be reached with a helpful Moon- Jupiter aspect. This is important, as the recent lunar eclipse fell in your house of goal achievement. Whether you like it or not, you will need the help of other people to get where you want to go.

"
1 august 2018,taurus,"This may be a day when you have to slap a smile on your face and suck it up, Taurus. With the two most hotheaded planets in the solar system–– Mars and Uranus–– in a tussle, people could be critical or egotistical. You may not feel like dealing with it, but fighting back could create even more problems.

"
2 august 2018,taurus,"The whole world doesn’t need to know the details about your love life, Taurus. With the Moon in the most secluded part of your chart, you should be keeping a lot of things to yourself. The upside to this is that you’ll add a lot more mystery to your union!

"
3 august 2018,taurus,"With the Moon in your sign, focusing on your needs, you may not be in the mood to go along with someone else’s agenda. This is an issue that is going to run through Monday of next week. Should you compromise? Not if it means giving up you are at the core.

"
4 august 2018,taurus,"With brilliant, independent Uranus in fine form in your sign, you may feel as though there is nothing you can’t accomplish! And you’re right. But don’t dive in right away. Uranus will go retrograde next Tuesday, giving you the opportunity to think things over first.

"
6 august 2018,taurus,"Now that love planet Venus is in your house of health and fitness, it would be smart for couples to start working out together!

"
7 august 2018,taurus,"A few months ago, iconoclastic Uranus entered your sign for the first time in 80 years. This trailblazing planet can bring about fast evolution, but sometimes the moves can be ill considered. It retrograde today, giving you some time to rethink your plans. This is true of every area in your life, so slow down your pace.

"
8 august 2018,taurus,"Venus and Mars form a fabulous aspect in the heavens today, which is wonderful for romance. But with these planets in the most practical parts of your chart, it’s time to have serious discussions. It could be anything from “where is this relationship going”, to who is going to be responsible for the food shopping. This may not be glamorous but it sure is necessary!

"
9 august 2018,taurus,"Slow down! If you’re expecting overnight success, or things to move at lightning like speed, think again. A Venus-Saturn square indicates that you need to take a slower long-term view. And if anyone in your world is pushing you, you need to slam on the brakes.

"
10 august 2018,taurus,"It’s one thing to meet people halfway. It’s another to be dumped upon. Take care of that you’re not carrying the full load within a relationship. This could be in your professional life as well as your business one. Don’t be afraid to speak up.

"
13 august 2018,taurus,"Stay true to yourself, Taurus. It may be tempting to emulate the people you see on glossy blogs or social media accounts. You might also be envious of some of the things going on in your friends’ lives. But a strong lunar aspect today recommends that you focus on your own contentment first, and march to the beat of your own drum.

"
14 august 2018,taurus,"Flexibility counts for a lot today. Leave extra time to get errands done and don’t expect everyone to be moving at the same fast pace as you. Be open to new ideas from colleagues and clients too.

"
15 august 2018,taurus,"Keep your eye on the prize, or the end result you want to see. Other people may be majoring in the minors today, and it could possibly throw you off track. This doesn’t mean that you should ignore the details; just don’t get stuck in them.

"
16 august 2018,taurus,"Chances are you’re going to be in a rebellious mood today, Taurus! With the Moon in your sign, you are not going to be interested in playing by other peoples’ rules. That’s okay. Who said that their rules really work, or make sense?

"
19 august 2018,taurus,"Domestic dramas should start to fade into the background, now that Mercury has gone direct in this sector. Issues with parents, roommates, children, a landlord, an ex….all of these should begin to dissipate. It’s about time, too. The Sun will be entering your house of fun and romance on Thursday, so who needs headaches?

"
20 august 2018,taurus,"Team efforts get a huge boost from a happy Jupiter-Neptune aspect. So do partnerships, be they romantic or professional. There is a fun sense of optimism, and people will be open minded. But don’t commit to anything or anyone today, as you could be a little bit too  optimistic!

"
22 august 2018,taurus,"Feeling a little obsessive? If so, blame it on detective planet Pluto, which is active and on the hunt for the 411. This can be a good thing if you’re researching a new job, say, or a medical treatment for an issue you’re dealing with. But if you’re going through your lover’s phone, snooping all of the messages they’ve received, things could get fugly.

"
23 august 2018,taurus,"Love heats up now that the Sun is in Virgo! If all you want to do is flirt and play around, that’s okay. The cosmos won’t judge. But if you want to go the more traditional route and settle down with someone, that’s quite a possibility too. Attached bulls could witness a romantic renaissance, so book a reservation at your favorite cafe or bed and breakfast.

"
24 august 2018,taurus,"If you’re not passionate about what you do for a living, it’s high time that you should be. A Mars-Moon connection is perfect for zeroing in on what new field you should move into. If you like the field you’re in but not the gig you have, this aspect will also help you find work elsewhere.

"
25 august 2018,taurus,"Feeling intrepid? Like you can take on the world? It’s not surprising, considering the amazing planetary energy on tap today in your sign. You’ll be ready to take a bold risk, whether it’s in love, your career or your free time—such as planning a trip around the world. Life’s too short for holding back.

"
26 august 2018,taurus,"One door opens, and another closes. That’s what full moons do and today’s lunation occurs in your house of friends and networking. As a result, you may decide to walk away from certain people and surround yourself with others who are more supportive of you. Or perhaps you’re stretched too thin with extracurricular activities and need to cut back. Either way, it’s all about maintaining healthy emotional standards.

"
27 august 2018,taurus,"Big plans may have been stuck over the past two weeks, anything from planning a nice vacation to job hunts to writing a manuscript. But red hot Mars has just gone direct in your house of adventure and taking risks. There should also be more cooperation from people, some of whom may want to team up with you. They know a winner when they see one.

"
28 august 2018,taurus,"Ooohhh, someone’s a bit touchy today! A Mercury-Jupiter square could put you or someone else in quite am emo place. Fortunately this passes by tomorrow, so you have to ask yourself if it’s worth it to get aggravated.

"
29 august 2018,taurus,"Breaking out of a comfortable groove can be difficult for your grounded sign. But there are people in your midst who have some fresh and interesting ideas. Why not listen to what they have to say and explore some new possibilities?

"
30 august 2018,taurus,"Today’s the kind of day when you might have to slap a smile on your face, suck it up and be nice to someone who may or may not deserve it.

"
31 august 2018,taurus,"Feeling spunky? Like you don’t want to take anybody’s flak? Like you could take on the world? Gotta love it–the Moon meets up with rebel Uranus in your sign. Go ahead, break all of the rules. Just stay out of jail.

"
1 september 2018,taurus,"You could be sensitive to criticism today, especially from loved ones. This is just a quick phase that won’t last long, as the emotional Moon is transiting your sign. By Monday you’ll be back on track and able to have a rational discussion.

"
2 september 2018,taurus,"It’s a wonderful thing when you feel comfortable in your own skin, and that’s what’s going to happen over the next few days. You’ve matured a lot lately and now realize that you don’t have to worry as much–about yourself and what others think about you.

"
3 september 2018,taurus,"There’s no point in trying to hide your feelings. As a matter of fact, it’s wise to let them show! You need to gain more cooperation from people, both personally and professionally. If this means saying things that they may not want to hear, so be it.

"

"
5 september 2018,taurus,"Yeah, baby! Chatty Mercury enters your house of romance for a three-week stay. It’s time to socialize, flirt or tell someone how much you love them.

"
6 september 2018,taurus,"Over the past few months, you may have been itching to get things going. Creative ideas, adventures, new love, your own business, you name it.

"
7 september 2018,taurus,"Today is a winner on many fronts! Your charisma is high and so is your creativity. You could be bursting with ideas that are so cutting edge that you’ll even surprise yourself. A new lover could be on the scene. Coupled up bulls could plan a vacation of a lifetime. Don’t waste this precious energy.

"
8 september 2018,taurus,"You have to learn how to crawl before you learn how to walk. Things take time! And if you try to run too far too fast, you risk falling down. Don’t let anyone convince you to jump into something if you’re not ready. And don’t put too much pressure on yourself either.

"
9 september 2018,taurus,"Yowza! There’s a new moon in your house of romance, and amorous Venus glides into your commitment zone. Can you spell L-O-V-E? Over the next few months a fresh chapter can begin in matters of the heart, so embrace it. You’re the envy of the other 11 signs!

"
10 september 2018,taurus,"Nothing can stop a bull when it’s charging towards something that it wants! Megawatt Mars is now in your house of ambition, and I pity the fool who gets in your way. The next two months are awesome for making progress on achieving dreams that are close to your heart. But don’t forget about love and having fun, as the sweeter things in life are also highly favored.

"
11 september 2018,taurus,"Relationships of all kinds get a wonderful boost from a number of planets in happy angles. You should be ready to take a chance…in love, business or connecting with new people. Whatever you do, don’t close yourself off from others. Your life will become richer if you allow them in.

"
13 september 2018,taurus,"The trolls could be out in force today, so ignore them, Taurus. You could even experience snarkiness from people close to you.

"
14 september 2018,taurus,"If anyone tries to hold you back today, I wish them luck. No way, no how, are you going to put up with anybody’s nonsense. This is true both at home and at work. Just a little piece of advice though…be careful what you say to the boss. Your family is another story!

"
15 september 2018,taurus,"You’re willing to take chances in many areas of your life, Taurus! But if you’re smart, you’ll do some serious research first. Fortunately for you, deep diving Pluto is in the mood for doing a good snoop. It doesn’t matter if you’re planning a world trip or world domination….the sky is the limit right now.

"
16 september 2018,taurus,"Lucky, abundant Jupiter is smiling from your house of commitment, anxious to solidify your romance. And if you’re not currently involved with someone, you should be out there looking. This entire week is a nice one for amour, especially this coming Thursday.

With the Moon in the most adventurous part of your chart, learning new things is the best way to chase down a dream.

"
18 september 2018,taurus,"Anyone who gets in your way today will experience the full wrath of charged up bull! The two most aggressive planets, Mars and Uranus, are at loggerheads today. Things could get mighty combustible, so think before you lash out. This is especially true with authority figures.

"
19 september 2018,taurus,"Is there someone whom you’ve been crushing on? Then take that chance and go after them today. Need to add more juice to an existing relationship?

20 september 2018,taurus,"The Sun will be leaving your house of fun and romance within 48 hours, but that’s no reason to get upset! A Sun-Mercury aspect today encourages you to plan your next set of adventures, things that will take place over the next few months. Sometimes we need to book these things in our calendar to make sure that they get done. Otherwise it’s work, work, work.

"
21 september 2018,taurus,"It’s time to get real about your level of vitality, Taurus. If you’re overweight and out of shape, the cosmos has you in its crosshairs! The same goes if you’re not getting enough sleep or not treating your body like a temple. Mercury enters your health sector today and the Sun goes there tomorrow. You can run, but you can’t hide.

"
22 september 2018,taurus,"Practicality rules for the next four weeks now that the Sun is in the most efficient part of your chart. People may try to sway you over to their way of thinking. I wish them a lot of luck! Your best bet is to not get into an argument with them; just ignore them and do things your way, quietly.

"
23 september 2018,taurus,"This is no time for taking crazy risks. Nor is it a time to let other people let a plan go off the rails. This may mean that you’ll have to step up and take control of the situation. But with assertive Mars in your house of authority, this will be no problem.

"
24 september 2018,taurus,"Are you feeling caged in? By your job, a lover, bad health or not having enough money? From your chart it appears that way.

"
25 september 2018,taurus,"People could so bogged down in rules and details that absolutely nothing will get done! This includes you, by the way. Sometimes we need to step away from a situation in order to see the bigger picture. Take a break, consider what’s going on and climb to the top of that mental mountain for 360° view.

"
26 september 2018,taurus,"“Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be.” So said Abraham Lincoln, and his sage advice applies to you today. If you choose to be miserable, you will be…but you can also choose to see the brighter side of life.

"

"
30 september 2018,taurus,"You will be able to mix practicality and fantasy today. Your creative juices are flowing, but so is your logic. It’s a great day to put together a vision board of the things that you’d like to have enjoy and your life. Others may say that your ideas are crazy….but what do they know?

"
1 october 2018,taurus,"You may feel like doing something out of the ordinary, something that will get you noticed. But is now the right time to garner all of this attention? From your chart, it appears that your best work should be done behind the scenes. Keep a low profile for now.

"
2 october 2018,taurus,"People will be talking in circles today, so don’t expect clarity. Seeing the big picture, or the end result, may also be difficult. Don’t let this bother you. The new Moon next Monday is the perfect time for seeing things for what they are.

"
3 october 2018,taurus,"If you need to say something, today’s the day to get it out there. The passionate Moon is in the most expressive part of your chart, and Venus is in the diplomatic sector. You should be able to speak without yelling, and communicate with meaning.

"
4 october 2018,taurus,"Your bullish side could rear up today, and if anyone waves a red flag you’ll be ready to charge. Slow down there, el toro. You run the risk of hurting people’s feelings, or worse….making an enemy out of someone who supports you.

"
5 october 2018,taurus,"Are you in or are you out? Venus begins to retrograde in your partnership zone, making you question romantic AND business connections. Fortunately this will be over by Halloween, so you won’t be caught in limbo forever.

"
6 october 2018,taurus,"Should you blend in with the crowd or do things your own way? That’s the question with a Moon-Neptune opposition. It may be tempting to fit in, but you could pay a price. There’s nothing wrong with being a rugged individualist.

"
7 october 2018,taurus,"People may demand a lot from you today and into next week. Chances are that you’ll start feeling resentful about it too. While tomorrow’s new moon occurs in one of the most cooperative parts of your chart, you don’t have to do everyone else’s job.

"
8 october 2018,taurus,"Today’s new Moon is the best time all year to get organized and back on track with tasks and yes, your diet! But you could be feeling especially bullheaded about it, refusing to dive in. Ask yourself this: do you really want to wake up six months from now and have the same pile of papers on your desk and a muffin top? No? Then get moving.

"
9 october 2018,taurus,"You’re in a highly practical,”let’s get things done” kind of place. As a result, this is a good time to negotiate, work things out and make sure that other people are doing their share. Mercury is now in your house of serious relationships, easing the journey ahead.

"
10 october 2018,taurus,"Feeling bullish? Watch out there, el toro–your forceful side could come out with a vengeance today. Diplomacy could go out the window as you try to push your agenda. This is not a good plan. Play nice.

"
11 october 2018,taurus,"You’re surrounded by people who seem to have their heads stuck in the sand, unable to see what’s in front of them. This energy is going to continue for a few more days. But fortunately, the clouds break today—for a little while, anyhow. So if you need to get a point across or gain cooperation form others, get cracking.

"
12 october 2018,taurus,"You know what they say: if you want to travel to distant lands, you have to leave the shore! And that’s the message that the cosmos has for you today. Don’t get so caught up in preparation or planning or the details. At some point ya just gotta act.

"
13 october 2018,taurus,"Remember all that stuff that you mama said about jumping off bridges——if a friend of yours does it, are you going to follow and do something stupid? That’s the message that the cosmos has for you today. Avoid going along with the crowd, because they may not know what the hell they’re doing, or worse—they’re trying to throw you off course intentionally.

"
14 october 2018,taurus,"Take a look at your life’s bucket list, if you have one. At the very least, do a mental review. Today’s Moon-Saturn aspect is a winner for making smart, calculated risks. It’s time to stop putting some of these things off. Put them in to play!

"
15 october 2018,taurus,"People around you may need a gentle push to do what you want. Maybe it’s a kid who needs to clean their room, or a lover who needs to open up more. Maybe it’s a business associate who could use some direction. The good news is that you won’t need a hammer to drive a point home.

"
16 october 2018,taurus,"Why not change the way you express yourself? Write a book. Switch up your social media strategy. Learn to speak another language. Shake things up a little bit!

"
17 october 2018,taurus,"Your motivation should rise now that the Moon joins Mars in the most ambitious part of your chart. You’re better off working alone rather than teaming up with others, at least for the next few days. By Sunday people will be ready to cooperate with you.

"
18 october 2018,taurus,"Doing things the same old way can be a bad idea sometimes, but at other moments it’s the right tactic. Pay attention to your methods: are you taking too many risks?

"
20 october 2018,taurus,"Dreaming big dreams, planning adventures, sharing thoughts and feelings… that’s what friends are for. A wonderful Moon-Neptune aspect enables you to get even closer to the people in your tribe. You will be able to inspire each other and have fun this weekend.

"

"
23 october 2018,taurus,"Ready for commitment and being diplomatic? Or do you want to do your own thing? El Sol enters your house of serious relationships, but spunky Uranus is firing up your stubborn side. Being bullish could backfire. Try to see both sides of an issue.

"
28 october 2018,taurus,"It’s your turn to shine a little bit, Taurus. With so much recent planetary activity in houses that deal with other people, you may feel as though you’ve been left out. Come on, step right up to center stage. Take a bow and bask in the limelight!

"
29 october 2018,taurus,"Changes are happening in the way you handle your relationships with other people. Generous Jupiter is encouraging you to be more open and patient. Try to give people the benefit of a doubt. If they don’t respond, at least you know you did all that you could.

"
30 october 2018,taurus,"Transformative Pluto is in your house of taking risks and living a bolder life. But who should you bring with you on your journey? Consider the company you keep very carefully. Only allow people in who are willing to take the same chances that you are.

Just remember that we all have our own individual paths to walk in this world. Don’t feel that you have to change your plans to fit in with other people.

"
3 november 2018,taurus,"You seem to be driven by values that are a cut above what other people select. This doesn’t mean that you are better than they are; it’s just that you expect more from yourself and out of life. Don’t let anyone try to make you back down from what you believe.

"
4 november 2018,taurus,"Live for the moment, Taurus. Yes, you need to get things done. But it appears that you’re racing through life without taking some much-needed downtime. Set aside quality time for yourself and your loved ones.

"
5 november 2018,taurus,"Group endeavors and activities with the tribe pick up steam. And with a new Moon arriving tomorrow, all sorts of wonderful things can happen in the near future with these people. Truth be told, you may be the visionary of the group. It may take other people a little while to catch up with your ideas.

"
6 november 2018,taurus,"It’s time to wrap up unfinished business, Taurus. It’s also time to get rid of emotional baggage that is holding you back.

Put your past behind you.

"
7 november 2018,taurus,"It’s time to show your rivals (and the people who believe in you!) what you’re really made of. Not only will you put on a game face, you’ll be able to walk the walk too. The new Moon in Scorpio helps you develop stronger connections both in love and in business.

"
8 november 2018,taurus,"Yeah, baby! Optimistic, healing Jupiter moves into your house of intimacy and sex. This sector also governs your net worth. The next 12 months are your best in over a decade for scoring in more way than one (LOL)! More sex, more cash, more private moments…..gotta love it.

"

"
11 november 2018,taurus,"Don’t let other people tell you what you’re capable of, Taurus. The best judge of your talent is you. Let your imagination soar and be willing to try something new. The only people you should take with you on your journey are those who believe in you.

"
12 november 2018,taurus,"Life should start looking a lot sunnier thanks to the Moon and Pluto meeting up in the most optimistic part of your chart.

Adventure is calling your name and it’s time to break out of an old mold. Once Mars changes signs on Thursday, you should seek out advice from a trusted mentor.

"
15 november 2018,taurus,"Feeling secure about who you are is mighty important, Taurus. No matter what is going on in the world around you, as long as you feel comfortable with your own values you’ll be OK. Be choosy about who you hang around with. Make sure that your friends share the same values as you.

"
16 november 2018,taurus,"You need to slow down and make sure that major financial and romantic decisions are spot on. Mercury has just gone retrograde in a house that governs both. It’s one thing to be optimistic; it’s another to be foolish and ignoring danger signals.

"

"
18 november 2018,taurus,"This is no time to let details get past you. Make sure that you are turning out good work. This is especially true if you’re working with a group or team. Everyone needs to be in sync, and it may fall on you to ensure that it happens.

"
19 november 2018,taurus,"If something sounds too good to be true, it probably isn’t! Which is why you need to be careful of someone trying to sell you some happy-happy BS story. People could also be trying to get you to do things their way. The bottom line is that you don’t have to.

"
21 november 2018,taurus,"If anyone thinks that you are a pushover, they’re in for a big surprise. You weren’t put on this planet to do everyone else’s grunt work. You could have an “aha!” moment today, the kind that makes you realize that you’re worth a lot more than you may have realized.

"
22 november 2018,taurus,"You’re not in the mood for taking unnecessary risks. With the full moon in one of the most security-conscious parts of your charts, you want answers, not more questions. Over the next two weeks you should get them.

"
23 november 2018,taurus,"Your level of passion for a particular relationship pr project may be low today. That’s because the moody Moon is in a funky spot. Don’t worry, by next Monday you’ll be feeling interested in the world again!

"
24 november 2018,taurus,"Confusion about friends or team activities should start to dissipate now that Neptune has gone direct in your house of networking. But you still need to keep an eye open for hangers-on or trolls who just want to throw shade at everyone. Be selective.

"
25 november 2018,taurus,"Some of your more audacious plans may need to be scaled back a bit. The good news is that you’re thinking big. The bad news is that you may be veering off into fantasy land. That said, don’t let other people put down your ideas. You’re going somewhere and they may be a bit jealous.

"
26 november 2018,taurus,"Ready to see some big money? Interested in a sexy, strong relationship? Yeah, I thought so. They’ll be happy to learn that the Sun and Jupiter form a conjunction today, the most auspicious aspect possible. This only happens once a year and it is considered to be very lucky.

"
27 november 2018,taurus,"It’s time to start associating with movers and shakers, Taurus. Several fabulous aspects today indicate that you could go far in matters of the heart and finance.

"
28 november 2018,taurus,"Road trip! My two favorite words in the English language, and maybe they’re your favorites too. This is an excellent time to plan a group vacation with the tribe, the more adventurous the better. It’s time to go off the grid and have crazy stories that you’ll be telling your grandchildren.

"
29 november 2018,taurus,"Got a secret admirer? It sure looks that way from your chart! Or maybe you’re crushing on someone. If you’re happily involved in love, then today’s cosmic energy is super for a romantic rendezvous behind closed doors. Ggrrrrrr.

"
30 november 2018,taurus,"If you’re not getting cooperation from people, deep resentment could build. Maybe you’re already there and you’re ready to explode!

"
1 december 2018,taurus,"The planets are sending you mixed messages about romance! Today, Mercury goes retrograde in your house of commitment.

This should help ease things, and by the 12th your romance can start developing momentum.

"
2 december 2018,taurus,"People could get pushy today, but that doesn’t mean you have to go along with their plans. You need to do what’s right for you, especially when it comes to love and money. However, you don’t need to push back. Venus enters your house of diplomacy, enabling you to speak your piece calmly.

"
3 december 2018,taurus,"You need to be a team player these days, Taurus. No, really. The stubborn bull routine is simply not going to fly. Keep your emotions and ego out of things, at least for now.

"
4 december 2018,taurus,"These days it may feel difficult to communicate with loved ones. That’s because Mercury is retrograde in your house of commitment. But today brings some healing energy from the moon. Don’t worry; Mercury resumes direct motion on Thursday and things should straighten out shortly thereafter.

"
5 december 2018,taurus,"The more people talk, the more confused you’re going to become! That’s because murky Neptune is acting up in your house of friends and networking. From your chart it appears that you will become easily annoyed by this too. No wonder. Take a deep breath and step away for a few days.

"
6 december 2018,taurus,"Partnerships of all kinds take a turn for the better today. Mercury resumes direct motion in your house of committed relationships. And there will be a new Moon tomorrow in another house that governs love and money. It’s time to make a fresh start, whether it’s in your love life or your professional one.

"
7 december 2018,taurus,"Are you ready for more love and sex? Looking forward to seeing more dinero in your pocket? Yeah, I thought so. Then you’ll be happy to know that today’s new Moon occurs in your house of love and money. However, Mars and Neptune are in a tough angle from your house of friends and networking. Don’t let pals or colleagues get involved in your personal affairs.

"
8 december 2018,taurus,"Be more selective about the company you keep, Taurus. And don’t feel as though you have to become part of a certain crowd. You’re good enough as you are; there’s no need to change your values or personality in order to fit in.

"
9 december 2018,taurus,"Joining forces with others is a smart way to go. Far too often, you stubbornly do things on your own. You may think that you’re the only person who knows how to do things the right way. But from your chart, it appears that you can hook up with folks who are movers and shakers themselves.

"
10 december 2018,taurus,"Your ability to connect with other people increases today. Not only can this help you, it will mean a lot to them. You’re not a strong bull for nothing! If others need to lean on you, let them.

"
11 december 2018,taurus,"Should you get tough with someone or cut them some slack? That question may be on your mind as you question what someone is saying or doing. If in doubt, wait 24 hours before making a decision. Your intuition is strong but you could use more intel.

"
12 december 2018,taurus,"Things that have been bothering you have been bubbling up to the surface, thanks to the recent new moon in one of the most emotional parts of your chart. Fortunately, eloquent Mercury enters this sector, enabling you to speak your piece logically and calmly. Holding things in just isn’t worth it.

"
13 december 2018,taurus,"Recent decisions that you made may have been off, but that’s OK. No one goes through life without making mistakes. Your values are changing, and that means that your plans will change too. That’s how you’ll make smarter choices in the future.

"
14 december 2018,taurus,"Just because someone is a friend, acquaintance or colleague doesn’t mean that they ned to know everything that’s going on in your life. Keep some things to yourself, especially since you’ll be meeting new folks.

"
15 december 2018,taurus,"We’re known by the company we keep. A strong lunar aspect today encourages you to slow down and consider who your friends and acquaintances are. Also, think about groups you may be part of, such as a volunteer or charity team. Are these the right people for you? Do you want to make more friends if you’re feeling a bit alone? Now’s a good time for changes.
 
 

"
16 december 2018,taurus,"There is a time to take risks and then there is a time to stay away from them. Fortunately for you, the universe is telling you to put yourself out there little bit more! Logical Saturn has your back. From love to money to travel to study, the world is your oyster. Have fun.

"
17 december 2018,taurus,"There could be some kind of shakeup coming in a team or group, both professionally and personally. But for you this is a good thing. Perhaps you haven’t realized it, but some of these people may have been holding you back. Now the brakes are coming off and it’s your turn to shine.

"
18 december 2018,taurus,"Sometimes emotional healing is a long and difficult process, with plenty of meetings on a therapist’s couch. But sometimes it can happen with lightning like speed. That’s what’s going to happen today, Taurus. A powerful Uranus aspect is just the ticket for recognizing what emotions need to go. Chuck them and move on.

"
19 december 2018,taurus,"It’s up to you to feel good about yourself; others can’t do it for you. So drop the blame game and take responsibility for whatever is bothering you. Remember, you have the strength of a bull.

"
20 december 2018,taurus,"Healing can happen for more quickly than you realize, bull. So if your tired body or soul needs “fixing”, ponder what you can do to get the process started. Be open to new modalities and ideas because the Sun will be soon entering the most forward-thinking part of your chart.

"
21 december 2018,taurus,"El Sol changes signs today, gliding into your house of taking risks. In a nice coincidence, Jupiter and Mercury are winking at you from your house of sex! WHAA?? I guess you need to be more adventurous in the boudoir, babe! But you could also take some risks when it comes to starting a business, traveling to destinations that are off the grid or learning more in a class.

"
22 december 2018,taurus,"Got places to go and people to meet? I’ll say! The full moon occurs in one of the most social parts of your chart. Keep an open mind, as the cosmos could send new connections your way that are out of the ordinary.

"
23 december 2018,taurus,"There’s nothing wrong with having big ideas, and you seem to have plenty. People around you have noticed. Don’t be surprised if you receive some kind of offer or discover that people want to team up with you.

"
24 december 2018,taurus,"People could be a tad emotional today, Taurus. This includes friends as well as family. You can try to get to the bottom of things, but it probably won’t work. Wait until Thursday, when the aspects for communication are much better.

"
25 december 2018,taurus,"Merry Christmas, Taurus! The Moon is now in your fuzzy, warm domestic sector. It’s a wonderful day for relaxing with the people you love the most, and that includes friends. A party atmosphere is building throughout the rest of the week, so get ready to paint the town red.

"
26 december 2018,taurus,"People tend to reminisce about the past at holiday time. But your sign maybe feeling mushier than the rest. Blame it on the Moon in Leo, which is transiting your house of relatives and childhood memories. To your surprise, old memories that you had forgotten may come rushing back. Brilliant Uranus is lighting up the house of the subconscious mind.

"
27 december 2018,taurus,"If you’re not certain about what step to take next, reach out to a friend or mentor. They can provide you with valuable advice. Don’t take action right away though; wait until motivational Mars enters Aries on New Year’s Eve. Aries is your house of research and quiet reflection.

"
28 december 2018,taurus,"You may feel like an untamed, bucking bronco over the next few days. Uh…is there anything wrong with that? Hell no, it’s your nature! So why are other people trying to subdue you? Maybe they’re afraid that you’re going places. You are.

"
29 december 2018,taurus,"Make a vow to surround yourself only with the very best of people. With Mars moving through your house of friendship and networking, it’s critical that your inner circle reflects who you really are as a person. Remember this as you make new friends and contacts.

"
30 december 2018,taurus,"Have you completely had it with a muffin top, or a beer belly? Fed up and tired with being sick and tired? The cosmos is handing you a ration of whoop ass today, Taurus. It’s reality time. If your health and fitness levels aren’t up to par, it’s up to you to change them.

"
31 december 2018,taurus,"New Year’s Eve may be here, but you may not feel like a party animal. That’s because Mars enters the most secluded part of your chart. Even if you do decide to go out on the town tonight (and you’re entitled to!), over the next few weeks you may pull away from the crowd. It’s time to do some serious inner work.

"
8 march 2018,gemini,"No matter how pulled together you are, no matter how efficient, there are new hacks and apps and techniques that you can use to make your life easier. And with Jupiter retrograding in your productivity sector, you’d be wise to start looking into some of these things. This is true both at home and the workplace. You’ll free up more spare time and feel less stressed—a total win-win.

"
9 march 2018,gemini,"You could be in quite an assertive mood today, but watch that it doesn’t turn into aggression. You want you want and that’s OK, but if your needs involve others, they may resent a pushy attitude.

"
10 march 2018,gemini,"You could be quite starry eyed today as Venus is casting her spell. Day dreaming about big future plans is always fun, but if you want to see any of them manifest, you have to get down to the nitty gritty. Are you ready to do that Gemini?

"
11 march 2018,gemini,"Make sure that you’re surrounded by people who support you, Gemini. According to your chart there are those who might be opposed to your ideas or values. Can you agree to disagree, or is it time to make some new connections?

"
12 march 2018,gemini,"Help or support might come from a surprising source, Gemini. But you can’t sit around and wait for it to show up on your doorstep. Think about who has the skills, connections, resources or wisdom to help you–and then reach out to them.

"
13 march 2018,gemini,"Your career can gain momentum over the next few weeks. One of the best ways to pull this off is to impress muckety mucks with your level of organization, discipline and talent. Choose team members wisely though, as there could be some slackers and trolls who want to dim your light.

"
14 march 2018,gemini,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Gemini, something that you would be wise to remember. In your rush to get things done you may overextend yourself. Set aside some time for enjoying the sweeter things in life.

"
15 march 2018,gemini,"Creating long term wealth is possible, thanks to the Moon gliding into your house of success. But you need to consider the other people who might be involved, such as a spouse or business partner. It’s imperative that they share the same values and good habits as you.

"
16 march 2018,gemini,"Ready to set off on a new career path? Then start getting inspired. A delicious Moon-Neptune aspect will help you develop a few good options. Once the new moon arrives on Saturday, you can take the necessary steps to follow your bliss.

"
17 march 2018,gemini,"Feel like creating wealth? I’m talking Big Bucks, not chump change. If that’s the case the cosmos has your back! Two planetary aspects today can help you go from broke to rich: the new moon in your house of ambition and success, and Mars entering your net worth sector. You are in an awesome  spot for making changes. No lottery tickets here though; hard work does the trick.

"
18 march 2018,gemini,"Soul sucking jobs are not your lot in life, Gemini, so don’t think that it’s your karma to have to put up with them. Once the Sun enters Aries on Tuesday you will be meeting many new people, some of whom will have excellent connections and ideas for you.

"
19 march 2018,gemini,"If you’re looking for a new job, raise or to boost your company’s revenues, the planets have your back. Make that big ask. Shop your resume. Develop a marketing or social media campaign. Ya don’t ask, ya don’t get!

"
20 march 2018,gemini,"Despite the fact that the Sun is now in the friendliest part of your chart, you need to be circumspect about the people you allow into your world. Likewise, you shouldn’t be spilling all of your personal details to them. Mercury goes retrograde in this sector on Thursday. Be confident, breezy and friendly, but above all, be cautious.

"
21 march 2018,gemini,"Start reaching out to people who can help you with your goals, Gemini. It doesn’t matter if you’re trying to lose weight or snag a promotion—gaining wisdom or cooperation from others is the key to making things happen.

"
22 march 2018,gemini,"Your life is your own, Gemini–don’t let anyone run it for you. Over the next few weeks you may need to pull away from friends or even business contacts. Mercury is now retrograde in your house of networking and friends. Be sociable, cooperate with others but be the master of your own fate.

"
23 march 2018,gemini,"Sometimes the nicer you are the more you get taken advantage of! Sad but true, and that’s the kind of energy going on for your sign today. Don’t be a pushover; stand your ground.

"
24 march 2018,gemini,"Aggressively pursuing your own agenda could backfire on you, so think before you hassle people. It’s important right now to at least appear  to be a team player. Suck it up and compromise, even if you think it’s going to kill you.

"
25 march 2018,gemini,"It’s always a good thing when someone thinks that they can take on the world or new challenges; that’s the only way that things of importance are done! But don’t get too carried away with your ideas. They need to have a stable, practical base to stand on first.

"
26 march 2018,gemini,"Watch what you post on social media or put in a text, as a tense Moon-Mercury square could find your words being forwarded to too many people. This is true within friendships, the office or even outside activities like a sports team or a club that you’re part of. Sshhhh!!

"
27 march 2018,gemini,"It’s such a cliche that your sign has the gift for gab, but a superb Moon-North Node aspect today suggests that your words can take you very far indeed! Consider blogging, writing a book or screen play, hitting the lecture circuit or teaching. You may have a message that people need to hear.

"
28 march 2018,gemini,"You could make some interesting new acquaintances over the next 48 hours, people who could shake up your life…in a good way! This is the best time in 2018 to make new friends or industry connections, find a lover or pick the mind of a mentor. Get out there and network.

"
29 march 2018,gemini,"Whose rules are your playing by, Gemini–yours or someone else’s? Other people may be trying hard to get you to play by their game plan. But if their values don’t match yours, things could fall apart. Get clear on this before you go any further.

"
30 march 2018,gemini,"Don’t settle for table scraps when it comes to your career, Gemini! The new moon on the 17th has opened the door for you to find more meaningful and higher paying work, but you need to walk through it.

"
2 april 2018,gemini,"Slow down there, skippy! I-want-it-now Mars is burning through your house of sex, love and net worth. But if you’re too anxious to seal a deal you might make some serious mistakes. Remember, you have a logical side of your brain, the left half. Use it.

"
3 april 2018,gemini,"Just how committed are you to being a team player, Gemini? Fortunately the planets are lining up in such a way as to help you find people with your passion for your work, sports, hobbies and life in general. Surround yourself with people who know how to give and receive.

"
4 april 2018,gemini,"You don’t need anyone else’s permission to run your life the way you choose, Gemini. Your values and dreams may not mesh with those of the people around you, and that’s fine. How boring would life be if we all thought alike?

"
5 april 2018,gemini,"Trying to keep up with the Kardashians (or anyone else you know who likes to spend too much) could backfire on you big time, Gemini. Keep your credit cards locked up and keep FOMO at bay. Let everyone else worry about the state of their finances.

"
6 april 2018,gemini,"If you need to heal a rift with a lover, co-worker or friend, today’s a good time to do so. The emotional Moon is in the most diplomatic part of your chart, telling you to get over your ego (and anger, resentment, pride and whatever else is holding you back).

9 april 2018,gemini,"It’s time to stop doing things the same old way and use your imagination! Besides, the more you’re willing to think creatively, the greater a chance you have of finding solutions to problems that have been vexing you for months.

"
10 april 2018,gemini,"Watch your words today, Gemini. Yes I know, you love to chat, but if you make proclamations about things without truly having knowledge about them you may appear foolish. Let someone else make an ass of themselves.

"
11 april 2018,gemini,"Ggrrr!! The cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, are winking at each other across the heavens today. Better yet, they’re in houses that govern sexuality, seclusion and intimacy. What can I say, other than to get a room?

"
12 april 2018,gemini,"Mercury is still retrograde in your house of teamwork, and that means that not everyone is willing to cooperate or play fair. It’s up to you to decide whether you want to put up with it or not. Is it time to walk away from some commitments?

"
13 april 2018,gemini,"It’s always easy to look at other people and identify what they’re doing wrong, but when it comes to analyzing ourselves….not so much! But a helpful Jupiter aspect will enable you to do just that today. Be honest, be brave and then make the necessary changes. Jupiter is all about abundance, its goal being to bring you better people and circumstances in life.

"
14 april 2018,gemini,"There are several ways to get things done your way. One is to get in everyone’s face and make a big deal about it. Another method is to assert quiet power and dignity, allowing others to process your intention. The latter is the best MO to use over the next few days.

"
15 april 2018,gemini,"Who’s on Team Gemini? Who would you like  to have on your team? There could be some big changes to your contact list over the next few months. Mercury has been retrograding through your house of friends and networking, possibly revealing who you can count on and who you can’t. It goes direct today, so it’s decision time.

"
16 april 2018,gemini,"There’s an old saying about how we become like the five people we hang around with the most. Whether that’s a good thing or not is a question that only you can answer. Today’s new moon in your house of friends and networking is the perfect time to cut ties that are no longer right for you, and to meet new folks who are.

"
17 april 2018,gemini,"Despite the recent new moon stirring up energy in the friendliest part of your chart, you’ll need to choose your connections carefully over the next few months. Saturn begins to retrograde in your house of love and money. Don’t fall for an irresponsible lover or a slick salesperson who wants to con you. Be choosy with the people you allow into your world.

"
18 april 2018,gemini,"Team efforts get a shot of adrenaline thanks to a spunky Sun-Uranus conjunction! It’s also a wonderful time to make new connections, and this could happen in a most unusual way.

"
19 april 2018,gemini,"The Dalai Lama has famously said that if you think that everything is someone else’s fault, you will suffer a lot. But when you realize that everything springs from yourself, you’ll learn joy and peace. And that’s the message that the cosmos has for you today, Gemini.

"
20 april 2018,gemini,"An intense period of introspection begins as the Sun quietly glides into Taurus, your twelfth house of the subconscious mind. The kinds of thoughts you think, the emotions you experience, your habits, sorrows and joys: all of these are up for review. The next four weeks will be the most intense but this energy carries out for several months.

"
21 april 2018,gemini,"Your emotions could be going all over the place, due to aggressive Mars stirring up the pot in your house of deep feelings. Logic will be in short supply today, so do yourself a favor and keep your mouth shut….and those fingers off the keypads. Otherwise you might say something that you’ll end up regretting.

"
22 april 2018,gemini,"Pluto governs power, and the kind that exists between lovers is always an interesting situation. People kill for love, they die for love. I’ve even heard that they’ll obsessively snoop their lover’s text messages and e-mails! Pluto has just retrograded in your house of intimacy and sexuality. It’s time to get real about how you handle your  emotions when it comes to amour.

"
23 april 2018,gemini,"Thinking long term about the future is the way to go these days, Gemini. If all you’re worried about is short term gratification you’ll miss out on opportunities to secure your future, both romantically and financially.

"
24 april 2018,gemini,"Sweet! Glam girl Venus enters Gemini, making you the sexiest thang in town. Over the next three weeks you’ll turn a lot of heads, that’s for sure! Makeover magic could also be calling your name, enticing you to reinvent yourself. Have fun!

"
25 april 2018,gemini,"Just how fast do you want a romantic relationship to go, Gemini? Or new friendships? You need to slow down and get to know other people better before you form a deeper bond. It’s not that they’re trying to deceive you; it’s a matter of developing trust.

"
26 april 2018,gemini,"Yowza! Lusty Mars and, uh, penetrating Pluto meet up in your house of sexuality and intimacy today. This is truly one of the steamiest days of 2018 for your sign. But beware of thinking with your private parts instead of your brain. In addition, jealousy and other stinky emotions could reach epic proportions.

"
27 april 2018,gemini,"Lovers and friends might be working your nerves due to a Moon-Mercury opposition. You’re coming from a place of desiring teamwork and openness, but others may not be feeling the same way. You can choose to get pissed off or ignore it. The full moon on Monday will bring everything to a rolling boil, so wait until then to make decisions.

"
28 april 2018,gemini,"Your emotions could easily get the best of you today due to a Moon-Mars square. Either you’ll be dreaming up worst case scenarios or others will find it all too easy to push your buttons. Fortunately the full moon on Monday is in the most practical part of your chart, so you’ll gain clarity pretty quickly.

"
29 april 2018,gemini,"You’re craving stability in your life and today’s Sun-Saturn aspect is well aspected to make it happen. Both your financial picture and your love life are poised for improvement, but it won’t happen by magic. You need to improve your financial habits and the way in which you cooperate with a lover if you ant to see changes take place.

"
30 april 2018,gemini,"The full moon in Scorpio is all about getting caught up on chores and unfinished projects. While you’re at it, get rid of time-wasting habits and ineffective systems. There is some seriously positive energy coming from planets in your net worth and career sectors, but if you want to see the big bucks, you need to get organized first.

"
1 may 2018,gemini,"Yesterday’s full moon fell in your ultra-organized sixth house, demanding that you get your act together, both at home and at the office. Problem is, Uranus is in a tough spot from your house of teamwork, indicating that you may be surrounded by slackers, egomaniacs and other slugs who don’t want to pull their own weight. Don’t get stuck carrying their load.

"
2 may 2018,gemini,"Lovely Venus is in your sign, putting your desires front and center. And what’s wrong with that?  It can’t be about other people all the time. Unfortunately there are those who do  think that it should be all about them. It may be time to set some boundaries.

"
3 may 2018,gemini,"If there’s one message that the cosmos is trying to send you right now, it’s to get your house in order. This literally means your abode, but also your body, mind and soul. There’s no room for sloppy habits, low energy or scattered thinking. Pull it together.

"
4 may 2018,gemini,"Snap out of it! There’s no room in your life for raging emotions taking you all over the place. Fortunately mature, wise Saturn is on the job, helping you to become more balanced and logical.

"
5 may 2018,gemini,"Read the fine print if you’re making any major financial decisions right now, whether it’s an investment or a job offer. It’s not that people are trying to deceive you. But you have to make sure that deals are fair, and that you don’t end up in a position in which someone has you under their thumb.

"
6 may 2018,gemini,"Some people are arrogant, needing to assert their authority and push people around. But you know better than that. A stellar Neptune-Sun aspect allows you to be quietly authoritative. Sometimes keeping a low profile is the best way to get attention.

"
7 may 2018,gemini,"People who are relying on you could be demanding, and you may end up feeling that nothing you do can please them. If your actions have been impeccable, then let it go. But if they’re even partially right you may need to clean up your act.

"
8 may 2018,gemini,"You’re running the risk of burning out, Gemini. From your chart it appears that you’ve been pushing yourself too hard. There are only 24 hours in a day and you seem to be trying to fit in 30 hours of activities! Office related stress could also be draining your energy levels. Give yourself a much needed break.

"
9 may 2018,gemini,"Money doesn’t grow on trees but you could certainly find greater sources of it if you’re willing to try. The Moon’s position in your ambition sector could spark some clever ideas. Friday is another fabulous time for inspiration to strike.

"
10 may 2018,gemini,"Your imagination soars as vibey Neptune jazzes up your brain with inspirational thoughts, especially where your goals are concerned. You’re about to enter one of the brainiest periods of your life in which your mind can become the path to riches and great contentment.

"
11 may 2018,gemini,"This is no time to hold back, Gemini. Yeah, I know, your sign is famous for being oh-so-verbal. But in reality you keep things inside. A helpful Sun-Pluto trine enables you to get the words out on topics that you may have kept under wraps for a long time.

"
12 may 2018,gemini,"Trying to relate to others could feel like walking into a wall, Gemini. No matter what you say or do, your meaning will be misconstrued. The problem is that aggressive Mars could push your buttons and annoyance (or even anger) will be the result. Take a deep breath and wait for another day with better aspects.

"
13 may 2018,gemini,"Now that logical Mercury is in the house of your psyche, it’s time to get real about issues that have been plaguing you. You can certainly seek wisdom and help from outside sources, but don’t forget that your own inner wisdom is there to guide you as well.

"
14 may 2018,gemini,"Over the next few days a surprise event could occur with a friend, business contact or even with someone you haven’t met yet! So be open to meeting new people, but be selective too. When Uranus enters your house of seclusion tomorrow, you’ll be quite choosy about the company you keep. You may find that your own company is the best!

"
15 may 2018,gemini,"You are now entering one of the most intense psychological periods of your entire life, Gemini! Brilliant Uranus is in the house of your subconscious mind and seclusion. Over the next eight years you will be healing emotional wounds from the past and cutting toxic ties. Many of you will become interested in developing your intuition and studying Eastern philosophy. The journey will have twists and turns but it will be worth it.

"
17 may 2018,gemini,"A conflicting push-pull vibe is in place as Mars squares off against Uranus. Part of you is raring to go (maybe even where angels fear to tread) while another part of you (your intuitive mind) is holding back. When Venus changes signs on Saturday you’ll be in a better place to figure out your next move.

"
18 may 2018,gemini,"Getting a grip on your emotions, fears and issues becomes a heck of a lot easier thanks to a healing Mercury-Saturn trine. Rational thinking wins the day, so cut out foo-foo thinking. If you need professional help, seek it. Otherwise be your own best friend and figure out what needs to be changed.

"
19 may 2018,gemini,"Here’s a nice little early birthday present for you: profitable Venus enters your money sector today! If one of your wishes for the year ahead is to see more green, take action now and over the next three weeks.

"
20 may 2018,gemini,"Yes!! The Sun is now in your sign, Gemini. Happy birthday! What’s going to make this birthday year different from those in the past is that you’ll be searching for more security in love and your career. Posh Venus just entered your house of spending, recommending that you treat yourself to some birthday treats over the next three weeks.

"
21 may 2018,gemini,"Speaking from the heart becomes a lot easier thanks to a Moon-Saturn aspect. The Moon is emotional and passionate, while Saturn is logical and calm. It’s the perfect combination for venting without coming off like a whiner, diva or crazy person!

"
22 may 2018,gemini,"“Do things the same way you’ve always done them, and you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.” If that old saying makes you feel uncomfortable, then now’s the time to shake up your routine and attitude. Fortunately inspirational Neptune is in an awesome place for making this happen.

"
23 may 2018,gemini,"You’re running the risk of underestimating how much time and effort a project will take, Gemini. You may also be unclear as to how dedicated other people may be to a particular cause or situation. Before you proceed, do a lot of thinking and get to the bottom of these issues.

"
24 may 2018,gemini,"This is truly one of the best days in 2018 to make a wish upon a star. The Sun trines go-getter Mars, making you feel as though the sky is the limit. And why not? The only thing holding you back are your own fears—and they seem to be falling by the wayside.

"
25 may 2018,gemini,"Feel like you’re in a career rut? Then today is superb for coming up with fresh ideas as to how to bust out of it. An unusual Jupiter-Neptune trine zaps you with creative ideas that could turn things around. 

"
26 may 2018,gemini,"The iron fist in the velvet glove? That image is what the cosmos suggests for you today, Gemini. You don’t need to beat people over the head to get your point across. With subterranean Pluto increasing your self esteem in one of the most secluded parts of your chart, you can assert a subtle authority.

"
27 may 2018,gemini,"Put your wallet and credit cards away. Don’t even think about window shopping. The same goes for trawling for swag on the net. A stern Venus-Saturn opposition could push you to spend for emotional reasons, when you really need to save.

"
28 may 2018,gemini,"Blowing off your fitness routine and diet may look mighty fine today, thanks to the Moon being in a pissy mood! You may also not feel like cleaning the house or doing much at the office. If you can get away with it, just slack. Once Mercury goes into your sign tomorrow you can get back on track.

"
29 may 2018,gemini,"Your birthday season gets another boost as sharp little Mercury moves into Gemini. This will put you into a practical mindset over the next three weeks, ready to tackle new challenges.

"
30 may 2018,gemini,"The recent full moon in your partnership zone asks you to set your own agenda aside, at least for a bit.

Fortunately verbal Mercury is now in your sign, making it easier to be diplomatic with others.

"
31 may 2018,gemini,"A financial matter that may have been causing confusion or sleepless nights lately will start to clear up. That’s because your ability to see things from a more logical perspective is increasing. With shrewd Mercury now in your sign, you’ll be able to get right to the heart of the matter.

"
1 june 2018,gemini,"The sky’s the limit! That’s the message the cosmos is sending your way. With megawatt Mars in fabulous spot in your house of thinking big, you can pull off just about anything. Just don’t blab too much about your plans, as chatty Mercury is in way too talkative a mood.

"
2 june 2018,gemini,"You’re oozing charisma from every pore of your body, thanks to a magnetic Neptune-Venus trine. Naturally this makes it easier than ever to impress others, whether it’s a potential boss, lover or client. So don’t be shy about showing off!

"
3 june 2018,gemini,"With energetic Mars touring your house of big picture ideas, you should be thinking bold and long term. The red planet and the Moon form a magnificent angle, telling you to go after what you’re most passionate about. Life is too short to play it safe all the time!

"
4 june 2018,gemini,"This is your  time of year, Gemini, something that you’ll be reminded of today! A winning Sun-Mercury aspect in your sign boosts your confidence and helps you gain clarity. There may be times later in the week when you feel unsure, but they pass quickly.

"
5 june 2018,gemini,"Head trips and ego battles could erupt with a Venus-Pluto opposition. Don’t stoop to this. If you’re at the receiving end of someone’s else’s passive-aggressive behavior (or outright pompous fit), the let them know that they can take their drama elsewhere.

"
6 june 2018,gemini,"All of the thinking and planning in the world doesn’t mean a thing unless you’re wiling to take action, Gemini. Doubts may arise due to a Mercury-Neptune square. Do you have the chops to pull things off? Well, you won’t find that out from just sitting on your butt, will you?

"
7 june 2018,gemini,"Your big plans for the future may have a hazy feel about them as you try to figure out what to do next. Blame it all on foggy Neptune, which is stirring up the mist in your house of goals and success. The upside is that the Sun in your sign is working hard to burn off the fog, so clarity will return soon.

"
8 june 2018,gemini,"The past few days may have made you feel insecure or unimportant, and fortunately that planetary energy has passed like a fast moving storm. Now the Moon is in your house of partying and meeting new people, just in time for the weekend. So get out there and shake your tail feathers!

"
9 june 2018,gemini,"With the Sun in your sign you’re bound to attract attention. Problem is, some people may feel as though you have too  much going for you….which could stir up envious glances and remarks. Too bad, they’d better get used to it! Once the new moon in Gemini shows up next week, you’ll have even more mojo.

"
10 june 2018,gemini,"Your intuition is spot on with the Moon in the most psychic part of your chart! Use it to your advantage, as there could be people around who are trying to persuade you to do things their way. Coming up with genius ideas is also possible, so let your mind take you to a creative place.

"
11 june 2018,gemini,"There are only 24 hours in a day, Gemini, something that you seem to be forgetting. Optimistic Jupiter is in your efficiency sector, making you feel as though you can take on the world. Not only is this not possible, but you’ll only end up feeling burned out and resentful.

"
12 june 2018,gemini,"Three separate planetary aspects happen over the next 24 hours, and all of them are designed to showcase you and your talent! Today nimble Mercury zips into your second house of security, helping you score a raise or higher paying job. Over the next month you could make a lot of progress, so get the ball rolling.

14 june 2018,gemini,"A sense of dissatisfaction may be running through your heart and head, as your subconscious mind is processing things that don’t quite fit in your life. As a result you may decide to pull away from the social scene as you ponder your alternatives. Spend the next few days in thought.

"
15 june 2018,gemini,"If at all possible, don’t enter into binding financial situations today. Mercury, usually so shrewd a negotiator, is up against long-term Saturn. They are both in financial houses, which means that deals that you enter into could be shaky. This includes jobs, mortgages, stocks or even creating a joint account with a lover. Next Tuesday is a much better time for making your move.

"
16 june 2018,gemini,"Creating more structure in your life is the message the cosmos has for you over the next week, Gemini. This has more to do with your daily routines and habits than it does your personal relationships. Your career especially is about to go through a transformative period, so be ready to take advantage of new options that come your way.

"
17 june 2018,gemini,"We all need to communicate in some way when it comes to our career. Some of us need to improve our negotiating skills while others should be focusing on their writing style. Whatever area needs to get stronger, work on it today and over the next few weeks.

"
18 june 2018,gemini,"Career matters might slow down now that Neptune is retrograde in your ambition sector. Expect job offers or business deals to get bogged down as people are confused or slow to respond. That said, you could uncover new ways to make money or even decide to change fields.

"
19 june 2018,gemini,"Who says that Geminis are flaky social butterflies? You’ve got practicality oozing out of every pore with this week’s super-efficient aspects.

"
20 june 2018,gemini,"You know the saying, “If you can dream it you can do it”? That applies to Geminis today, thanks to a fabulous Neptune-Mercury aspect. Any major goal of yours that you’d like to go after should be considered. Mercury will provide you with logic and Neptune will douse you with inspiration.

"
21 june 2018,gemini,"Even though the Sun enters Cancer, one of the houses that deals with stability for your sign, things may feel like they’re up in the air. This could be anything from your love life to career to travel plans. From your chart it looks like the issues at hand are big ones, the kind that demand that you take a risk. When Mercury enters the brainiest part of your chart on the 29th, you’ll be able to figure out your next move.

"
22 june 2018,gemini,"Support may come from a source you didn’t even know existed! Someone may try to help you behind the scenes—to find you a new job, hook you up with a potential mate or just to be a good friend when you need it most.

"
23 june 2018,gemini,"This is not a good time to ask people in positions of power for favors….or money, for that matter! Wait until next week when the full moon arrives on Thursday.

"
24 june 2018,gemini,"There’s no point in being jealous over someone else’s success. With a helpful Moon-Pluto aspect you can create your own “luck” by applying yourself to your own endeavors. As long as you don’t expect overnight results, you can make a lot of headway.

"
26 june 2018,gemini,"Bigger isn’t always better, Gemini! Megawatt mars has been blazing a path through one of the most optimistic parts of your chart, super-sizing your plans. But the red planet is now retrograde, advising you to slow down and take a second look at what you’re doing.

"
27 june 2018,gemini,"It’s time to get clear–crystal clear–about your finances, Gemini. You may feel as though circumstances are holding you back from heading in a prosperous new direction, but actually things could pick up steam over the next few weeks. But first you need to have a good handle on your cash flow and investments.

"
28 june 2018,gemini,"The full moon in the sexiest part of your chart could encourage you to toss caution to the wind.

Think before jumping into the sack or committing your heart.

"
29 june 2018,gemini,"There’s no holding you back, Gemini. Verbal Mercury is now in your house of communicating, so you’ll be more than ready to say what’s on your mind. From your chart it appears that you have a number of emotional issues that need to be cleared up, so get to work on them first.

"
1 july 2018,gemini,"People may be annoying the daylights out of you with their indecisive behavior. They may not be doing it deliberately, but still–you want to know what’s going on! Pushing for an answer will backfire, so either back away or try a more indirect approach.

3 july 2018,gemini,"You don’t have time to waste on people or activities that aren’t important. Abundant Jupiter is pushing you to tie up loose ends and become more productive. Once it goes direct next week, you should start seeing the payoff for all of your effort.

"
4 july 2018,gemini,"Don’t be too quick to give away your personal power, Gemini. You don’t have to beat people over the head like a tyrant, but it’s not smart to be too passive either. Think of the iron hand in the velvet glove metaphor, and you’ll nail it.

"
5 july 2018,gemini,"You know how people say “I started doing less yet I got more done”? That’s the kind of vibe going on for your sign today, Gemini. You’re in a highly productive place in which you can find hacks that will free up more time.

You’ll be able to put people on notice that you’re expecting a lot more cooperation, without beating them over the head with a broom.

"
10 july 2018,gemini,"Keep your cards close to your vest, Gemini–and your wallet as well. A tense showdown between the Sun and Pluto in your financial houses could bring out the snake oil salesmen. Before making any important decisions about taking a new job, making an investment or signing legal documents with financial ramifications, slow down. Ask questions. Snoop around behind the scenes if need be.

"

"
13 july 2018,gemini,"Today’s solar eclipse in your money sector ushers in an exciting brand-new period in which you can earn and save more.

20 july 2018,gemini,"You don’t ask, you don’t get! That should be your mantra today. Don’t assume that other people have a clue as to what is going on in your mind. Even if they do, you need to speak up and claim what is yours.

"
21 july 2018,gemini,"Your sign is famous for being out on the town having fun, but this weekend the energy is all about staying at home. The two most beneficial planets in the solar system, Venus and Jupiter, are both in a good mood from your domestic sector. Go ahead: clean the house, buy some new sheets and then test them in the bedroom later.

"
22 july 2018,gemini,"You should be as happy as a pig in mud! Today the Sun enters Leo, your chatty third house of socializing and communicating. Just don’t say too much or go too wild in the partying department. Mercury is scheduled to retrograde in the same house this coming Thursday.

"
23 july 2018,gemini,"Decision-makers and business contacts may be talking in circles today, Gemini. It could be difficult to separate reality from the fluff. As a result, don’t make any major decisions right now. You also need to watch your tongue! With Mercury about to go retro grade in your communication sector, you could accidentally say the wrong thing.

"

"
25 july 2018,gemini,"Someone could say or do something that will throw you off guard, Gemini. You may become defensive, or even angry. But are you reading too much into it? It’s quite possible with erratic Uranus and a bad position today. Wait 24 hours before you respond. You may realize that your initial reaction was off-base.

"
26 july 2018,gemini,"Think before you speak! Mercury is now retrograde in your house of communication and short distance travel . You know the drill: don’t lock your keys in the car, make sure you don’t send emails to the wrong person and don’t leave sensitive documents in the copier at work. But this is also a good time for going back and re-examining projects that mean a lot to you. It’s all about strategy.

"
27 july 2018,gemini,"Ready to bust out of an old groove? Even if you aren’t, the cosmos is getting ready to kick your rear end into action! A high octane lunar eclipse occurs in your house and taking risks. Over the next six months you can cover more ground than you have in the past few years. The best part will be looking at the surprised faces of all the people you know, who are shocked at what you’ve achieved!

"
28 july 2018,gemini,"This is an excellent time to open up and speak your mind, especially with people who have been difficult to approach. Keeping your thoughts and feelings bottled up isn’t going to help anyone. Yesterday’s eclipse fell in your house of taking risks. Why not start by being candid?

"
29 july 2018,gemini,"You could see opposition today to some of your ideas and opinions, Gemini. The recent lunar eclipse fell in the most open-minded part of your chart, encouraging you to think in bigger brushstrokes. Not everyone around you will have the foresight to see how smart some of your plans truly are. Forge ahead anyhow.

"
30 july 2018,gemini,"It’s time to find some balance in your life, Gemini. Abundance of Jupiter is pushing you to take care of old chores and improve your habits, but you run the risk of burning out. There are only 24 hours in a day and your energy supplies are limited.

"
1 august 2018,gemini,"You may be pushing hard to make progress, but it may feel like unseen forces are preventing you from making headway. Once Uranus goes retrograde next Tuesday, you’ll be able to suss out exactly what is mucking up the works. Until then, slow down and relax.

"
2 august 2018,gemini,"It wouldn’t hurt to be more of a team player today, Gemini. Not only will you be able to get more done, there could be a happy upside to this that you just don’t know about yet. You never know whom you might impress.

"
3 august 2018,gemini,"You need to read between the lines of what other people are saying. Just because you are being straightforward doesn’t mean that they are. It’s not so much that they are lying. Rather, they maybe overestimating their abilities.

"
4 august 2018,gemini,"You may experience an “aha!” moment today, thanks to the Moon meeting up with brilliant Uranus. Chances are, you won’t be coming up with some kind of newfangled invention or the cure for world peace. But you can dig deep into your psyche and find peace in your own mind.

"
5 august 2018,gemini,"From your chart it appears that you need to adjust the way you speak to others, Gemini. It’s not that you’re being rude. But people in your world may be on head trips or can’t see the forest for the trees. You are going to need to cut through the smoke and mirrors and make things clear.

"
6 august 2018,gemini,"The next four weeks are looking luscious for love as Venus is in your house of romance!

"
8 august 2018,gemini,"This is a lucky day for romance, as Mars and Venus form a harmonious trine in the heavens. There is a highly social vibe going on too, so plan a luscious date night if you are already attached. If you’re not, the best place to meet someone is by being out and about. A friend could make a sweet introduction.

"
9 august 2018,gemini,"Balance needs to be maintained in your closest relationships, Gemini. There has to be a good mix of independence, yet a feeling of comfort and commitment too. It’s a day to go within and examine your psyche. Is there anything that you are doing or thinking that will upset that balance?

"
10 august 2018,gemini,"Tomorrow’s solar eclipse occurs in your third house of thinking and communicating. Naturally, this involves collaborating with other people. Right now either you or someone within your group is hellbent on focusing on little stuff that doesn’t matter. Take the long view and get yourself out of this rut!

"
11 august 2018,gemini,"Your sign is famous for being social butterflies, so you’re going to love today’s solar eclipse. It occurs in your house chatting, partying, networking and buzzing about the neighborhood. But it could also open up a thoughtful period in which you do a lot of deep thinking, strategize with others and take classes. It’s all about self expression, so write that book, start that blog or work on your art portfolio.

"
12 august 2018,gemini,"You might be tempted to really let your emotions and your mouth rip. Yesterday there was a solar eclipse in your house of communicating. And today, red hot Mars retrogrades back into your house of intimacy and psychological depth. You could choose to blast everyone who is pissing you off, or you could choose to do some deep reflection. I suggest the latter.

"
13 august 2018,gemini,"If something feels off, it probably is. Pay attention to what your gut is telling you. People may be way too to anxious to get their own way, and they could use flattery to try to lure you in. Maintain a safe distance and do your own thing.

"
14 august 2018,gemini,"It’s time to pamper yourself, Gemini! With the Moon forming a perfect angle with luxe Venus, you really should indulge in activities that make you feel good. Don’t wait for someone else to treat you like a king or a queen.

"
15 august 2018,gemini,"People might rub you the wrong way today, Gemini. A Moon-Pluto square could drum up drama and power trips. The problem is, you might overreact. Instead of doing that, ask yourself if these people belong in your life. The recent solar eclipse was all about making new connections.

"
16 august 2018,gemini,"Giving things up is never easy, whether it’s a bad habit or a connection to a person that isn’t the best.

Don’t worry––by tomorrow it should be a heck of a lot easier to make the cut.

"
17 august 2018,gemini,"Something positive could happen at the work front, but you need to be ready to seize the opportunity. Keep your eyes and ears open.

"
3 september 2018,gemini,"Feeling more verbal…..and assertive? This is positive, so run with it! Chatty Mercury is in fine form today, enabling you to charm the birds from the trees. But if charm doesn’t work, telling it straight will. Don’t worry—this is a confident and charismatic vibe.

"

"
1 october 2018,gemini,"This is not a smart time to enter into a risky financial proposition. This includes a job offer, investment, real estate…be careful about your next move.

"
14 october 2018,gemini,"The entire week ahead is wonderful for working out emotional issues, especially the kind that come from romantic entanglements. Not only can you work on your own baggage, but you should also be able to communicate better with a lover. Mature, calm Saturn is in a good angle today—use its wise energy.

"
19 january 2018,cancer,"Someone might dig in their heels today, most likely at the workplace. Clients and co-workers seem to be stuck in tunnel vision, unable to see more than five feet ahead of themselves. You, on the other hand, have dynamic Mars in the blue-skies-ahead, big picture sector. As a result, don’t expect others to appreciate the brilliance of your ideas. They won’t, and this continues into next week. But that’s OK. When Mars enters Aries on the 28th, you’ll become unstoppable.

"
13 march 2018,cancer,"You know what you want and you know how to get it, but don’t think that you have to go this alone. Consider who you’d like to take with you on your journey. Yes, your creativity and drive are strong, but other people can contribute with their own unique viewpoint and wisdom.

9 april 2018,cancer,"Envy isn’t a pleasant state to be in, nor is it any fun if it’s being directed at you by someone else.

"
10 april 2018,cancer,"From your chart it appears that you’ve been quite focused and rational lately. But the creative, emotional side of you is screaming to be acknowledged too. Have you forgotten how to be a vibrant human being, full of life and optimism?

"
11 april 2018,cancer,"With Mars and Venus forming a cooperative aspect in the heavens, it’s a good time for searching out people who share the same values and dreams as yours. This is true in love as well as business. They say that opposites attract, but do they stay together? Find people who can go the distance.

"
12 april 2018,cancer,"You may need to make it clear to others that you’re the boss of your own life, and that you don’t need or want their input.

"
17 april 2018,cancer,"Your serious relationships will be tested for strength and longevity now that Saturn is retrograde in this part of your chart.

But you should also be focusing on your own attitudes and behavior when it comes to romantic or business alliances. A true partnership involves an equal balance of power, a positive give-and-take. Are you experiencing that?

"
23 april 2018,cancer,"It’s critical to get clear about the “rules” of a relationship, Cancer. This is true of both personal and professional alliances. With the Moon in your house of structure and stability, you shouldn’t be flying by the seat of your pants.

"
24 april 2018,cancer,"You may be more interested in keeping your thoughts to yourself rather than sharing them, Cancer. Venus has just entered the most secretive part of your chart. This hush-hush vibe could also pull you into the bedroom more frequently for some steamy romps in the sack. Funny—I don’t hear you complaining!

"
25 april 2018,cancer,"Your intuition will be strong over the next few weeks along with your dream state and gut hunches. This is a big benefit, as there is a lot of energy focused on the next steps of your career and your love life. So don’t waste precious time: use that Spidey sense to your advantage.

"
26 april 2018,cancer,"Power couple? You could become one thanks to a serious meeting of red hot Mars and energetic, influential Pluto. This isn’t only true in love; you could also form one hell of a profitable business alliance. With a full moon coming soon in the most fun and creative part of your chart, new (and established) connections could take an adventurous turn.

"
27 april 2018,cancer,"Striking the right balance between your professional duties and your personal life could be an issue. The Moon opposes Mercury, creating a push-pull in which you may feel as though you’re not having as much fun as you’d like. That’s OK! The full moon on Monday falls in your house of flirting, romance, spending money on swag and going out to eat. It’s time to leave work behind at the office.

"
28 april 2018,cancer,"Trying to keep the peace could be difficult, so don’t even try! The problem is that you might go into typical Cancer nurturer mode, meaning that others will walk all over you. You’ve been dealing with enough nonsense lately from others. It’s time for them to respect you for a change.

"
29 april 2018,cancer,"Some long lasting connections could be made over the next week, the kind that will be life changing. Planetary activity in your chart indicates that exciting new people could come your way, but you need to be out there networking if you want to meet them. This includes new friends, business contacts, lovers or mentors. The more the merrier, right?

"
30 april 2018,cancer,"Your love life gets a jolt of juicy electricity from tonight’s full moon in your romance sector! It’s time to start enjoying a lot more fun when it comes to amour, so if a relationship is boring as hell (or fraught with anger and drama) this is the best time all year to move on. Happily involved? Then book more “play dates” with your lover!

"
1 may 2018,cancer,"Your creativity and optimism should be rising, thanks to a fabulous full moon yesterday in the house of talent. There should be no shortage of bright ideas going through that head of yours. The issue is that you may try to take on too much, like a little kid in a candy store. Create a short list and pursue those ideas to completion before moving on.

"
2 may 2018,cancer,"Breaking old habits isn’t easy, especially crummy thought patterns. Gentle Venus is trying to help you close out the past and all the toxic crud associated with it, but for some reason today your ego might be holding on with all of its might. This passes quickly, however. Ask yourself which is more important: hanging on to the past, or having a brighter future?

"
3 may 2018,cancer,"It’s time to go through your contact list and cut ties with people who just aren’t right for you anymore. Many times we hang on to attachments out of habit. With brilliant Taurus getting ready to enter your house of networking on the 15th, the company you keep is going to change dramatically—and the people will be movers and shakers.

"
4 may 2018,cancer,"Knowing what you want out of love becomes so much easier due to a potent lunar aspect. This is true even if you’re single (start writing that short list!). One thing that’s obvious from your chart is that you’re not going to settle for drama and discord. Sometimes it’s not a good thing to have an unpredictable lover!

"
5 may 2018,cancer,"Teamwork is a big theme running through your chart these days, and it’s a good idea to take a deep look into your connections. Are you being pushed around by others? Or are you acting like a bully? Is there ease, the ability to speak up and express your opinion? Take an inventory.

"
6 may 2018,cancer,"There’s a fierce independent vibe around you these days, the kind that can move mountains. So if you’re looking to make major changes, things that yesterday may have seemed like a pipe dream, know that you have the chops to pull them off. But pick a mentor’s brain first before diving in.

"
7 may 2018,cancer,"Criticism could come your way, but who cares! You’re on the right track and your detractors know it. Their remarks are just jealousy in disguise. Accept that fact, enjoy your life and let them stew.

"
8 may 2018,cancer,"Team activities could get convoluted, so stay on top of things if you’re involved in one. There could be creative differences or unrealistic expectations about deadlines or expenses. Jealousy or snippy attitudes could arise. Things should smooth out next week when Mercury enters Taurus.

"
9 may 2018,cancer,"Your opinions and ideas may be quite different from everyone else’s, but that’s OK! Actually, you’d be doing them a favor if you shared them with others. They seem to be stuck in a rut and could benefit from some fresh input.

"
10 may 2018,cancer,"People think that you’re risk averse, like a little crab that wants to hide in its shell. But they don’t really know you! A spunky Moon-Neptune aspect will show them that you’re made of tougher, more riskier stuff.

"
11 may 2018,cancer,"When brilliant Uranus glides into your house of teamwork next week, the company you keep will have a huge effect on your life, both personally and professionally. But you don’t have to wait till next week to make some important new connections. A Sun-Pluto trine today could introduce you to movers and shakers (and lovers!).

"
12 may 2018,cancer,"Cooperation could be hard to come by with a messy Mercury-Mars square. Trying to force people into doing their share won’t work. Indeed, they may feel justified to be slacking off. Teamwork will be easier to come by as of tomorrow.

"
13 may 2018,cancer,"Who can help you on your path through life, Cancer? Now that chatty Mercury is in your networking sector you really should start reaching out to other people. Friends could play matchmaker. A former colleague could tip you off about a job opening. BFFs could make you feel more alive. Mingle!

"
14 may 2018,cancer,"Erratic Uranus has been touring your career and goals house for the past eight years, getting ready to move on (phew!) tomorrow. But before it goes it hits you with one last blast of inspiration. Pay attention to gut feelings or thoughts that might be popping into your mind. You might decide to do a 180.

"
15 may 2018,cancer,"No more flying solo! Come out of your shell, Cancer. Rebellious Uranus is now in your house of camaraderie, encouraging you to team up with others for all reasons: finding love, furthering your career, having fun with pals or making the world a better place through volunteer work. Between now and 2026 your social circle will expand in ways that you simply can’t imagine.

"
16 may 2018,cancer,"Most of us rely on technology in our careers, and the new moon falls in the house of all things futuristic. Over the next six months you can make enormous headway with your website, online store, blog or app. If you’re smart you’ll work with the energy of the planets and become as skilled as possible with technology. Online dating looks good too!

"
17 may 2018,cancer,"The green eyed monster could raise its ugly little head today, so watch out for envy and snakiness. It’s not pretty regardless whether it’s coming from you or someone else. If someone is throwing shade your way, let it go. Venus enters your sign this weekend and you’ll have so much to look forward to that you won’t care.

"
18 may 2018,cancer,"Finding people whom you can trust to work with in a team environment isn’t always easy. But thanks to a winning Saturn-Mercury combo, you’ll be able to connect with folks who get where you’re coming from—and know how to get the job done.

"
19 may 2018,cancer,"Can’t figure out why you’re turning heads all of a sudden? Charismatic Venus just entered your sign, that’s why! And if you’re saying to yourself “no one will pay attention to me” then the next three weeks are super for building up your self esteem. Want a makeover? Venus is the planet of beauty. Let your inner beauty shine.

"
20 may 2018,cancer,"This is one of the best times all year to pull away from the madding crowd and to do things just for yourself. Now that the Sun is in the most confidential part of your chart you should be looking out for number one. Yesterday Venus entered your house of self-image and esteem. It’s time to pamper yourself and to get your psyche evened out; balance that chi!

"
21 may 2018,cancer,"It’s one thing to give and another to be walked on. With stern Saturn active in your house of diplomacy, you need to set more boundaries with the people in your world, and that includes your business life too. Gentle Venus is in Cancer, enabling you to get your point across calmly and convincingly.

"
22 may 2018,cancer,"If there is a book inside of you that’s dying to come out, now’s the time to work on it. The same holds true for a screenplay or blog. Or an Etsy store. Or seeing your face on the cover of Inc.  magazine because of your successful entrepreneurial venture. While you’re at it, why not plan an exotic vacation? The cosmos has your back!

"
23 may 2018,cancer,"You’re better off listening to your own inner wisdom and experience level rather than listening to other people, Cancer. Friends, lovers and colleagues may mean well, but their advice could be irrational and overly optimistic. If necessary, meditate to get the answers you seek.

"
24 may 2018,cancer,"Getting your emotions out in the open becomes so much easier with a cathartic Sun-Mars trine. Air your feelings to others. Or, if you just want to rid your mind of negativity, do your own thing: kickbox, journal, go for a walk in nature. Whatever you do, don’t keep them in.

"
25 may 2018,cancer,"Between now and August 19th you can experience a personal blossoming—of love, creative skills and career progress. Today brings an unusual Jupiter-Neptune trine, an event that will repeat again in August. Your ability to think fearlessly is heightened, so toss out previous limiting thoughts. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

"
26 may 2018,cancer,"You may need to be the one who takes control of a situation that could go off the rails, Cancer. Don’t worry—with strong man Pluto in the most diplomatic part of your chart, you can whip everyone into shape without a lot of drama. 

"
27 may 2018,cancer,"Amorous, fun-loving Venus is in your sign, making you crave the good life. And why not? You deserve it! The problem today is that a Debbie or Donnie Downer may feel like bursting your pretty red balloon. Tell ‘em to stick it where the Sun don’t shine.

"
28 may 2018,cancer,"Someone close may act a wee bit envious today, and from your chart you’ll be able to handle it. Level-headed Mercury is in a good spot, helping you keep an eye on the big picture. Someone else’s jealousy is not your problem…it’s their’s.

"
29 may 2018,cancer,"Cutting out bad habits and toxic ties can be gruesome a lot of the time. Procrastination is an issue, along with the mental noise and drama associated with releasing negativity. But you can move on with grace and ease thanks to tonight’s full moon in Sagittarius, which is your house of productivity and habits. Intelligent Mercury glides into the house of the subconscious mind too, an added bonus.

"
30 may 2018,cancer,"Yesterday’s full moon fell in the most organized, productive part of your chart. Over the next few weeks you need to dump overly optimistic, pie-in-the-sky thinking and get down to the basics. Yup, the cosmos is sending you a reality check. Accept it, get the grunt work done, and then you can go back to thinking on bigger terms.

"
31 may 2018,cancer,"A relationship problem that has been troubling you will benefit from a strong dose of wisdom coming your way. Saturn, who is like a sage old grandfather, meets up with the Moon. This will make it easier for you to see both sides of the situation with greater clarity and calmness.

"
1 june 2018,cancer,"If you need to get your thoughts out into the open, today is a wonderful time for doing so. A stellar Mercury-Mars trine is just the ticket for releasing thoughts and feelings that have been building up for far too long. If you need a shoulder to cry on, or a therapist who can help you with more serious issues, then find the right confidante.

"
2 june 2018,cancer,"The cautious crab is become bolder these days, thanks to a Venus-Neptune aspect designed to bring down barriers. These barriers are primarily in your mind, so kick ‘em to the curb and move on with your life. Don’t listen to those who tell you not to fly too high too fast; it’s their turn to be cautious, not yours!

"
3 june 2018,cancer,"If you cash flow has been a bit tight lately, things could turn around in the next few weeks. Profitable Venus will enter your income sector on the 13th, but you can get things going today. A Moon-Mars aspect is perfect for research. Consider starting your own business, coding an app, patenting an invention or entering into a licensing agreement. It’s all about passive income.

"
4 june 2018,cancer,"Over the next week people may be promising you the Moon and the stars. Or maybe your own imagination is going on wild flights of fancy! That’s OK. A solid Sun-Mercury aspect helps you cut out the fluff and figure out what’s real and what’s not.

"
5 june 2018,cancer,"Conflicts could arise within a close relationship as gentle Venus is pitted against strong man Pluto in the heavens. Unless you feel like getting run over, either step out of the way or stand your ground.

"
6 june 2018,cancer,"This is one confusing day in the cosmos as intelligent Mercury, usually so on-point, opposes murky Neptune. As a result, separating fact from fantasy will be difficult over the next 48 hours, so don’t even try. Just observe things closely and quietly. When Mercury enters your sign next Tuesday clarity will return.

"
7 june 2018,cancer,"With inspirational Neptune soaring through your house of thinking big, you should  be feeling as though the sky is the limit. But your subconscious mind is stirring up doubts and fears. This is a natural part of the process, so trust it—and work with it.

"
8 june 2018,cancer,"Planetary activity in the most sensitive, psychological part of your chart may have made you feel moody over the last few days. Fortunately the Moon glides into the most confident, authoritative part of your chart today, making you feel as though you can take on the world. “I’m ba-a-a-ack!!”

"
9 june 2018,cancer,"Over the next few weeks partners could be engaged in power plays, so get ready to stand your ground. A Moon-Pluto aspect today gets this started. People in both your personal and professional lives could act up, but what they don’t know is that Mercury enters your sign next Tuesday….and you’ll have no trouble in setting them straight.

"
10 june 2018,cancer,"Get clear about your values, Cancer. Do the same with any kind of message that you’d like to get out there. When intelligent and chatty Mercury enters your sign on Tuesday, it’s time to speak up.

"
11 june 2018,cancer,"Creativity is one of your most valuable assets right now, so make sure you devote time to it. This could be work-related or simply diving into hobbies, redecorating your place or switching up your look. Let your freak flag fly, Cancer! Don’t worry about fitting in with the crowd.

"
12 june 2018,cancer,"Yaasss!!!! All eyes–and ears–will be on you, Cancer. High visibility Mercury is now in your sign, helping you flirt, promote, negotiate and influence. Just keep some of your best ideas and words to yourself, as the new moon tomorrow falls in your house of secrecy.

If you connect the dots you’ll see that right now is an awesome time to quietly advance your career, income or revenue streams.

"
14 june 2018,cancer,"Feeling pressure to fit in with a certain group? Or maybe you desire to live like the people you see on social media or the blogosphere. There’s nothing wrong with trying to better your lot in life, but FOMO and jealousy aren’t going to cut it. No problem. Neptune’s upcoming retrograde spin will help you reshape your circumstances.

"
15 june 2018,cancer,"Someone may go up against you today, trying to lay down a new set of rules. Or maybe they are demanding an answer, or for you to go along with their plan. If something seems irrational about their demands, pay attention—they probably are off base!

"
16 june 2018,cancer,"It’s almost showtime, Cancer! The Sun will enter your sign next Thursday but the Moon is already there. This is going to be one of the most reflective years you’ve had in ages, and the cosmos is telling you that it’s time to take some risks. You won’t have to jump into the deep end of the pool, though….take your time and dip your toes in first.

"
17 june 2018,cancer,"Don’t bet the farm on a shaky venture, Cancer! Actually you should be watching the pennies as well as the big bucks, as the cosmos is telling you to be more conservative with your spending. This doesn’t mean that you can’t spend; just be absolutely sure of yourself before you do.

"
18 june 2018,cancer,"Your sense of bravado may fade a bit as Neptune starts to spin backward in your house of risk taking. But this is an important time as it will enable you to reassess big plans before you leap into them. This is especially true if you’re considering a business start-up, going to college or heading in a new direction in romance.

"
19 june 2018,cancer,"You ought to be put under arrest today….for unlawful possession of more charm and pizzazz than any other sign of the zodiac! Seriously, you have an unfair advantage over everyone else thanks to abundant Jupiter in a wildly happy aspect with Mercury. What can I say? Work it, honey!

"
20 june 2018,cancer,"So what, let people think you’re crazy! Your brain will be on fire with ideas that may seem out there to others, but they actually are quite doable. Don’t dismiss random thoughts that pop into your head; consider them. Once the Sun enters your sign on Thursday it’s all systems go.

"
21 june 2018,cancer,"Yasss!!!! The Sun enters your sign today, crowning you the celestial favorite. The next four weeks are all about you, Cancer. Where to start? Well, how about with (a) your finances and (b) your emotional state. A tense Venus-Mars opposition today indicates that you need more stability, both in your net worth and the inner landscape of your mind.

"
22 june 2018,cancer,"The Sun is now in your sign and you’re in the spotlight! A happy Sun-Uranus aspect suggests that you could meet someone in a serendipitous manner, so look and act your best. It’s also possible that an old friend or business connection could contact you out of the blue.

"
23 june 2018,cancer,"Despite the fact that rational Mercury is in your sign, someone may be unable (or unwilling) to see the logic in what you’re thinking or proposing. You can try fighting them, but things will only escalate. The bottom line is that Thursday’s full moon will bring everything to a head, and you’ll be in a better position to get your point across.

"
24 june 2018,cancer,"I recently heard a podcast in which someone said that our minds become “flabby” from underuse, the same way our body does if we don’t exercise it. I had never thought of it that way, but it struck me as being on target!A stellar Moon-Pluto aspect is perfect for doing mental “gymnastics”: learning how to meditate, reducing your knee jerk response to negative situations and reading up on philosophy.

"
25 june 2018,cancer,"By all means, keep your credit cards and cash locked up today! It’s not that someone is going to rob you. Rather, the two planets of abundance, Venus and Jupiter, are at odds in the heavens, clouding your judgment. It could be way too easy to overspend on swag and goodies that you can’t afford.

"
26 june 2018,cancer,"Is an ex on the comeback trail? Quite possible now that Mars is retrograde in your house of passion. This aspect could stir the pot in an existing relationship too, bringing out jealousy and drama. If you’ve become tired of a soap opera existence you may decide to move on.

"
27 june 2018,cancer,"People could be obstinate today, so avoid arguments if you can. The issue is that they may all actually have a good point, which will make it hard to reach an agreement. Tomorrow’s full moon could bring things to a head so keep calm and carry on.

"
28 june 2018,cancer,"How do you remain true to yourself without giving up your standards? How do you commit to someone without feeling restricted? That’s the question behind tonight’s full moon in your partnership zone. By all means, fall in love. Get engaged. Enter into a business alliance. But don’t sell out your core values.

"
29 june 2018,cancer,"Show me the money! Shrewd Mercury is now in your house of earning more and saving more. Take this energy and run with it, all the way to the bank! Don’t be surprised if someone wants to partner with you. Two heads could actually be better than one.

"
30 june 2018,cancer,"FOMO is all around you, so don’t fall victim to its green-eyed madness. People could get a little pissy over who has “more” than they do. With the Sun in your sign, there’s nothing that you can’t have or achieve–so don’t waste your precious time worrying about what others are up to.

"
1 july 2018,cancer,"Your popularity is on the rise, which is nice, but you still have to ask yourself if certain people are right for you. From your chart it looks like you need more peace in your daily life. Don’t allow in those who disrupt it.

"
2 july 2018,cancer,"You need to get your act together, and that means gaining control over emotional fiascos that have been going on. Whether other people are generating them or you are doesn’t matter. What counts is your peace of mind, which quite frankly is more valuable than a pile of cash.

"
3 july 2018,cancer,"Responsibilities have been weighing heavy on your mind, and it’s time to take a break! The Moon is in an adventurous mood, and it’s suggesting that you take a vacation (even a mini one). The good news is that this energy continues all the way into next week.

"
5 july 2018,cancer,"You’re gaining more clarity about what it is that you want out of life, and that’s half the battle, isn’t it? Focus like a laser beam. Your mind is a powerful tool….use it to your advantage.

"
6 july 2018,cancer,"Pushy people are out there, and they may be interested in seeing you part with your cash. Avoid high pressure sales people–keep your credit cards at home! And watch out for emotional spending today, a real possibility. Focus on earning more first.

"
7 july 2018,cancer,"If a friend calls you out of the blue and suggests an adventure, by all means go for it! But why wait for the phone to ring? Reach out to someone and plan some fun, or go out there and meet some new people.

"
12 july 2018,cancer,"Tomorrow’s solar eclipse occurs in your sign, and chances are you are ready to bust out of an old groove. But people around you may be hell-bent on seeing you stay stuck in the same old place, sorry to say. Maybe they’re jealous, or maybe they’re afraid that you’re going to move on. Either way, nothing is going to stop you!

"
13 july 2018,cancer,"Yes! The cosmos delivers a birthday goody right into your lap, a solar eclipse in Cancer.

"
15 july 2018,cancer,"Of all the signs of the zodiac, you’re in the best position for some startling new changes. Yesterday solar eclipse occurred in your sign, and it’s kicking open brand-new doors. The next few days are excellent for meeting new people, which includes business contacts, lovers and potential friends. But you won’t meet them if you’re holed up at home.

"
16 july 2018,cancer,"You can charm the birds from the trees with today’s luscious Moon-Venus aspect! Sweet talking Venus is in the communication sector of your chart. Go ahead––flirt, persuade, negotiate, ask and chat.

"
17 july 2018,cancer,"There’s a difference between being assertive and being pushy. A tense lunar aspect today could make you come off as being way too aggressive, so hold back. This could be annoying, because from your chart it appears that you’re getting tired of other  people being obnoxious. That’s okay. Once the Sun enters Leo next week you’ll be in the driver’s seat.

"
18 july 2018,cancer,"Getting your house in order is becoming a lot more important to you, Cancer. You may literally be straightening things up around your home. But it’s also important to straighten out your relationships with the people in your family. If you need to lay down some new laws,or get people to do more work around the house, Sunday is a good time to do so.

"
19 july 2018,cancer,"The green eyed monster may be making the rounds today, Cancer. Envy isn’t attractive, regardless of whether it’s coming from you or from someone else. If you sense that someone in your circle is jealous, it may be time to cut ties with this individual….or pull away subtly.

"
23 july 2018,cancer,"Is someone trying to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge? People around you may be full of crazy schemes these days. They may not be trying to deliberately deceive you, but their ideas could still be way off. Keep things real. Let your own logic and wisdom guide you.

"
24 july 2018,cancer,"Flattery will get you everywhere? People could be full of compliments today, but do they really mean them? Take everything you hear with a grain of salt. Likewise, keep the BS coming from your end to a minimum!

"
25 july 2018,cancer,"Team efforts could go off the rails as people can’t stick to their roles or follow the rules. Someone could be uncharacteristically difficult to deal with, something that you will have to deal with today. Once Mercury goes retrograde tomorrow, it will be much easier to rein people in.

"
26 july 2018,cancer,"Got money on your mind? You certainly should, considering that the Sun just entered your house of income a few days ago. You can make a lot of progress over the next four weeks when it comes to earning more. But with Mercury retrograding today in the same sector, don’t expect things to happen overnight. This is a good time to do research instead.

"
27 july 2018,cancer,"Love and money! Both of these will be highlighted for your sign with today’s lunar eclipse. Something very important to you may be coming to a successful close. But remember…..the power of an eclipse can be felt for months afterwards. If you don’t get what you want right away, beware of being pushy. Aggressive Mars is in a tough spot right now. Patience!

28 july 2018,cancer,"Close relationships get a boost from a helpful Venus-Pluto aspect. With gentle Venus in your house of communicating, you’ll be able to speak your mind and get your point across without a lot of drama and screaming. This is an excellent time to restore balance in alliances that are important to you. Being a doormat for other people to walk on is not the way to go!

"
29 july 2018,cancer,"Practicality counts for a lot today, especially where money is concerned. Don’t let anyone convince you to spend cash that you don’t have. And if a little voice inside your head tells you that you simply must  have something,  tell that little voice to take a hike.

"
30 july 2018,cancer,"Your desire to live a bolder, more colorful life increases exponentially! With the passionate Moon winking at abundant Jupiter, it’s all systems go. Don’t listen to people who tell you that you should play it safe. You’ve only got one life to live so live it well.

"
16 november 2018,cancer,"The holidays are upon us, and of all the signs, you’ll need to watch out for backsliding when it comes to your diet and fitness.

"
19 november 2018,cancer,"You don’t have to follow someone else’s vision, Cancer. But by the same token, you can’t expect other people to follow yours. From your chart it appears that the wisest thing to do is just follow your own wisdom. Thursday’s full moon will make this very clear.

"
21 november 2018,cancer,"Thanksgiving is almost here, and if there’s one thing that you want this year, it’s peace. Which means that if you have family members who have been known to stir up drama in the past, you need to put them in their place now. The same goes for a lover or an ex. Who needs the nonsense?

"

"
30 november 2018,cancer,"Are you stuck in a rut or thinking in outmoded ways? It sure looks that way from your chart. Wake up and smell the coffee, Cancer. Thinking small doesn’t serve you nor the world at large.

"
1 december 2018,cancer,"If your head is spinning off your shoulders this week when it comes to romance, there is a good reason for it. Mercury retrogrades today into your house of love, making you question what is going on. But tomorrow amorous Venus glides into the same sector, turning up the heat! Fortunately this scene should settle down by the 12th. Don’t make any major decisions until then.

"
2 december 2018,cancer,"Venus glides into your house of romance today, but you won’t have moon dust sprinkled in your eyes. Nor will there be any rainbows and unicorns in your general vicinity. You are into too practical a mindset for that, which is fine. You need a romance that is built on a stable foundation.

"
3 december 2018,cancer,"Big plans require vision, but they also need attention to detail and strategy. And today you may overlook that fact. Make sure that you’re not moving too quickly. Double check facts and numbers; review all written materials. Mistakes will cost too much time and money to fix.

"
10 december 2018,cancer,"You may be trying to make sense out of what a child or lover is doing or saying. If that’s the case, try a different tactic today. If you approach the problem from the same old direction you won’t get anywhere. Surprise them; it will pay off!

"
11 december 2018,cancer,"You should be proud of what you’ve achieved: no one can take that away from you! But for your chart it appears that you can go even further if you develop your skills. What would that require? Taking a class? A seminar? More studio time? Figure out what it is and then do it.

"
12 december 2018,cancer,"You’re in one of the most organized, efficient times ever, so take advantage of it. There was a new moon in this part of your chart last week, and today Mercury glides into this sector. Try to get caught up with as much stuff as possible by the 21st.

"
13 december 2018,cancer,"There could be a difference of opinion today and it could be huge. As a result you could find yourself surrounded by people who don’t support you. The question is this: do you want to get involved in this? Sometimes it’s best to not get involved.

"
14 december 2018,cancer,"You may feel like chucking your daily routine so that you can play instead, and if that’s the case, you have the cosmos’ approval! A zesty Moon-Mars connection could prompt you to call in sick….forget about the work on your desk or the chores at home….ignore your diet….and basically be a lazy slug. Who am I to criticize you?!

"
15 december 2018,cancer,"Right now there is a strong emphasis for becoming better educated, Cancer. This doesn’t only mean going to college or grad school. Maybe you should go to a seminar or take an online course. Maybe you just need to hang out with people who have the kind of skills you admire. Doctors and surgeons routinely take continuing education ed classes so they can perform at the highest level. What about you?

"
16 december 2018,cancer,"With the full moon approaching this weekend in your sign, you definitely want to know where things are heading. You want answers. You want clarity. You want commitment. Today is a smart time to do a lot of thinking, and communicating.

"
18 december 2018,cancer,"The universe is hell bent on getting you out of a funk. Transformational Pluto and motivator Mars are on the case. Think boot camp instructors, and you’ll have the right idea. “Get your sorry ass moving there, soldier!” is their battle cry. If you’re smart you’ll listen to them.

"
19 december 2018,cancer,"There is a time and place for everything, and today is not the time to break the rules. Just do what you have to do to keep people happy. By Friday you’ll be able to do your own thing.

"
21 december 2018,cancer,"Some lively cosmic aspects could bring new people into your life over the next four weeks. They will be a break from the usual types you tend to attract. This isn’t to say that your existing tribe is no good; just that you could benefit from some fresh viewpoints.

Leave your current job? Start a side hustle? Consider your options. Motivator Mars will be entering your ambitions sector on New Year’s Eve, which is perfect timing for 2019.

"
27 december 2018,cancer,"Your opinions count, Cancer. So don’t be afraid to say what’s on your mind! Not everyone will agree with you, but it’s not your job to change their way of thinking. All you can do is present your ideas.

"
29 december 2018,cancer,"“Life is either a daring adventure, or it is nothing.” This quote attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt applies to you today, Cancer. With motivational Mars spending a few last days in your house of taking risks, it’s time to stop playing it so safe.

"
30 december 2018,cancer,"There could be some last minute action surrounding your job, so be prepared. Maybe a client needs something ASAP.

"
4 january 2018,leo,"Mercury glides into your efficiency sector today, making it even easier to dive into your 2019 resolutions (plus the dirty laundry and the work on your desk at the office).

"
8 march 2018,leo,"Feeling comfortable in your own skin is going to become significantly more important over the next four months.

Pull it all together.

"
9 march 2018,leo,"What is it that you were put on this planet to achieve, Leo? There will be no holding you back with a Moon-Mars meet-up. You may feel at times that you’re out of your comfort zone, but that’s a part of growing and changing.

"
10 march 2018,leo,"You might be overestimating what can be achieved in a day, month or a year. From your chart it appears that you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself these days, Leo. Slow down before your physical and mental health take a hit.

"
11 march 2018,leo,"You’re a fixed sign, Leo, which means that you don’t make changes easily. Today’s one of those day when your logical mind is telling you to switch things up, but you’re stubbornly holding on to old viewpoints and habits. But consider the advantages to making the changes happen.

"
12 march 2018,leo,"Creativity is your forte, Leo, and today you could come up with genius ideas, seemingly out of the blue! The reality is that your brain is hard wired for artistic or cutting edge expression. Open up the gates to your subconscious mind and see what you come up with.

"
13 march 2018,leo,"There’s a strong spiritual vibe going on in your chart right now, lion. It’s not so much about connecting with a higher source, but rather connecting with your own inner voice. Pay more attention to what it  says to you than what other people do. If need be, shut out the noise so that your personal wisdom can flow.

"
14 march 2018,leo,"Trying to push square pegs into round holes just doesn’t work, Leo, especially when it comes to people. No matter how much you want them to change or do things your way, that doesn’t mean that they’ll conveniently do so. Just worry about yourself for now and let things take their own course.

"
15 march 2018,leo,"Benjamin Franklin used to say, “Take care of the pennies and the dollars will take care of themselves.” That’s good advice for you, Leo. Create a new habit of cutting back your spending on small stuff, because over time it adds up to a lot. This week’s new moon is all about building wealth.

"
16 march 2018,leo,"Feeling sexy and sultry? You should be with the passionate Moon cuddling up to amorous Neptune. Don’t feel shy about strutting your stuff, Leo. Make ‘em sweat and beg for more.

"
17 march 2018,leo,"A sparkling new moon in Pisces is just the ticket for more fulfilling romance and making mo’ money—nothing to complain about, right? Pisces is your eighth house of intimacy, sex and wealth, always a loaded ticket. Over the next six months you can make headway in both areas. Mars enters your uber practical house of efficiency too, helping you develop (a) the right habits for creating more cash flow and (b) a realistic view toward love.

"
18 march 2018,leo,"Today may seem like a sunny day when the clouds suddenly roll in and block out the light, then disappear. On, off, on, off…that’s how your emotions may flow. This too shall pass. Once the Sun enters Aries on Tuesday your optimism will return and become more of a steady force.

"
19 march 2018,leo,"From your chart it appears that you’re in need of some extreme self care. And since your sign is known for loving luxury and pampering, this shouldn’t be too much of a problem! Remember that scene in The Wizard of Oz  in which Dorothy and her crew reach the Emerald City and get all cleaned up? Get thee to the spa, Leo.

"
20 march 2018,leo,"Nothing ventured, nothing gained! With the Sun in the most optimistic part of your chart, you’re ready to roll and roar! But considering that Mercury will retrograde on Thursday in the same sector, you need to slow down and take one step at a time. You can pounce after Mercury goes direct on April 15th.

"
21 march 2018,leo,"Your sign is famous for being creative and talented, whether you’re a doctor, dancer or computer programmer. And regardless as to how good you are at what you do, you should consider deepening your skill set. Sign up for a class or seminar. Listen to podcasts. Read books. Become even greater.

"
22 march 2018,leo,"Slow down there, Leo! The Sun just entered the most adventurous part of your chart, making you anxious to live life to the fullest. But Mercury goes retrograde in the same sector. There are only 24 hours in a day and you can’t start a jillion projects at once. Stay on top of travel details too.

"
23 march 2018,leo,"Your optimism should be soaring thanks to happy planets in your house of open thinking and taking risks, but the trolls are out in force over the next few days. They’ll try to burst your bubble, but they won’t have any luck. You know where you’re heading, and they’ll be left behind in the dust.

"
24 march 2018,leo,"You’re feeling might impatient these days, Leo. And with the Sun in the most turbocharged part of your chart, you won’t appreciate anyone or anything that slows your roll. But if you push too hard people may decide to block your progress. Can you afford to make any enemies?

"
25 march 2018,leo,"You’re not the type to shrink from problematic people or issues, but the cosmos suggests that a little seclusion is necessary right now. You need to regroup, lick your wounds and get back into fighting shape.

"
26 march 2018,leo,"It’s a good day to lay low, Leo. Don’t put all of your cards on the table–let others wonder what you’re up to. Knowledge is power, and you need to gain the upper hand.

"
27 march 2018,leo,"What is your destiny, Leo? That’s the question the cosmos asks of you today. If you’re not happy with the way your life is going, know that your destiny was pre-set before you were born. Which means you don’t have to settle for crappy circumstances now.

"
28 march 2018,leo,"Something’s going to light a fire under that languid feline a** of yours, something exciting and cutting edge. It seems that you’ve been playing things a little too safe lately. Break away from restricting people and circumstances, if only in your mind. Make new plans and figure out how to pull them off!

"
29 march 2018,leo,"Today’s a smart time to slow down and review your progress. Whether it’s with your grades at school, your diet, a business plan or creating something new, you need to consider the long view. Maintain your optimism about the future but plan the days and weeks ahead.

"
30 march 2018,leo,"Try to remain focused on the present moment rather than “awfulizing” what might be coming next. Mindfulness techniques can really help. There’s a wonderful free 8-week mindfulness program online at www.palousemindfulness.com. (I have no affiliation with them!)

"
31 march 2018,leo,"The time has come to stop talking about doing things and actually DO them, Leo. Tonight’s full moon in your communication sector indicates that talk is cheap. Venus glides into the most ambitious part of your chart, saying, “OK, fierce feline…you gonna start crushing it, or not?”

"
1 april 2018,leo,"Mentally, climb to a high mountain peak and take a bigger view of your life. Recognize the “small stuff” (and people) for what they are–small. You’ve been in the dark forest for too long. Get to that summit and stay there.

"
2 april 2018,leo,"With so much planetary action in your house of getting organized, you may realize that it’s time to get off your duff and do  something. Which is good! But you need to pick one project and complete it before you move on to the next. Otherwise you’ll have your fingers in too many pies.

"
3 april 2018,leo,"Confucius is best known for his golden rule: treat others the way you’d like to be treated. Today’s aspects pass his wisdom on to you, Leo. Be generous, polite and kind. The laws of karma will see that it comes back to you.

"
4 april 2018,leo,"Multitasking may sound  like a good idea, but you run the risk of taking on too much. Blame it on energetic Mars in your efficiency sector, which could push you into burning the candle at both ends. Slow down before you burn out.

"
5 april 2018,leo,"They say that old habits die hard, and that’s true for your sign right now. Over the next week you’ll be forced to examine if all of your routines are actually as smart and efficient as you think they are. This coming weekend is a good time to start some new ones.

"
6 april 2018,leo,"A sudden burst of mental energy gives you a new viewpoint about your life and where you’re heading. Why continue to do things the same old way when new methods might work better? Consider some fresh options.

"
7 april 2018,leo,"You’re feeling more grounded these days thanks to wise Saturn setting up shop in the most practical part of your chart. Now it’s time to start applying that practicality to all areas of your life. Get them under control and you’ll feel a lot less stressed.

8 april 2018,leo,"You’ve been pushing yourself hard as of late, and now it’s time to sit back and recharge your batteries. The week ahead looks quite busy and you’ll need to muster all the energy you can. It’s a great day to chill at home, go out for brunch with friends or get a massage.

"
10 april 2018,leo,"It’s not your karma in life to be someone else’s rescuer, so get that idea out of your head right now. Just focus on getting your own act together. Others are responsible for their own lives.

"
11 april 2018,leo,"Remember that old childhood saying, “Every party has a pooper, that’s why we invited you”? Yup, it’s that kind of a day, leo. Someone may be hell bent on popping your balloon or using strong arm tactics to get their way. Don’t let this slow your roll. You’re on target and you know it.

"
12 april 2018,leo,"You’re highly motivated to get things done, and no one is going to be able to stop you. The great thing is that things may actually fall into place far more easily than you might have expected. Momentum becomes even greater at the time of the new moon on the 16th.

"
13 april 2018,leo,"Leos love their lairs, so living in a beautiful place is important to you. The next few days are super for some home improvement, whether that means cleaning out the closets (not fun but necessary) or buying gorgeous new stuff (lots of fun and absolutely necessary).

"
14 april 2018,leo,"You may have felt lately as though you’ve been slogging though knee deep mud, and if that’s the case you can blame it on Mercury being retrograde.

"
15 april 2018,leo,"With so much planetary activity in your house of getting organized, you may be feeling as though all you do is errands and grunt work.

"
17 april 2018,leo,"“Quality is not an act; it is a habit.” So said Aristotle a long  time ago, and he was right. Leo, your sign is all about quality, and if you want more in your life you’ll need to upgrade your daily efforts. Today disciplined Saturn begins to retrograde in your house of efficiency, pointing out areas that need improvement.

"
18 april 2018,leo,"RAWR!!  Today’s mantra is “Everyone is entitled to my  opinion”, and honey, you won’t be shy about expressing it. This isn’t about being a diva. It’s more about expressing ideas of yours that others may not be able to wrap their little brains around. You’re in a brilliant state right now in which your mind is coming up with cutting edge ideas. Make the most of them.

"
19 april 2018,leo,"It’s always fun to daydream but at some point you need to come back down to Earth. You will today, but it will be a gentle drop, not a crash-and-burn. You’re entering into a very practical phase and it’s important to see things clearly.

"
21 april 2018,leo,"If you’re thinking about going into weekend warrior mode with your fitness routine, think again! Yes, I know that bikini season is coming (north of the equator, anyhow) but the planets warn against trying to do too much too soon. Besides, is your regimen going to give you the results you want? Consider a different plan.

"

"
24 april 2018,leo,"From your chart it looks like you could benefit from having new friends, and you could meet them over the next few weeks. If you’ve been thinking about leaving one field of work and entering another, reach out to people. If they’re not local you should join online forums, private Facebook groups or listen to podcasts.

"
25 april 2018,leo,"Play by the rules today, even if you have better ideas about the ways that things should be handled. You’re dealing with some Luddites who are stuck in the past. Maybe they’ll come to their senses, maybe not. The bottom line is that you’re in a quite efficient place and that’s all that matters.

"
26 april 2018,leo,"One of your greatest strengths right now is to sniff out ways of getting things done smarter, faster and cheaper than everyone else.

"
29 april 2018,leo,"Making progress in your career is possible, but you have to be able to show the powers that be that you have the tenacity, discipline and habits to be a winner. That shouldn’t be any problem with today’s Sun-Saturn connection! Polish up your resume, clear off your desk, catch up on unfinished projects and come up with time and money saving ideas. Self-employed lions should do the same.

"
30 april 2018,leo,"Family and residential matters take center stage with tonight’s full moon in your domestic sector. Something important may finally come to a successful close, such as negotiations to buy a place, or putting an end to a family dispute.

"
4 may 2018,leo,"You’re getting more serious about making sure that your life is in order, from bill paying to eating well to being caught up on projects at the office. Today is a good time to create even more positive habits that will make your life run more smoothly.

"
5 may 2018,leo,"Keep your ego in check, Leo! A Moon-Pluto meet up could make up feel a bit arrogant. Yeah, we know, you’re the king of the jungle. But you do your best work when you silently sit back on your haunches, ready to pounce on your prey, rather than making a lot of noise.

"
6 may 2018,leo,"Securing your future is on your mind, Leo. Whether it’s your finances, career or love life, you’re looking to create better circumstances for yourself. Fortunately inspirational Neptune is on the case, providing you with ideas that will bring stability.

"
7 may 2018,leo,"Get ready to use your claws, lion. A volcanic Mercury-Pluto square could bring out egomaniac power trippers and divas, who might be looking for a fight. You’re the one with the upper hand (or paw), so don’t be afraid to scratch, roar or even bite back!

"
8 may 2018,leo,"You’re in quite an authoritative mood and place right now (and why not?) but other people may not like it one bit. Let ‘em stew. Their expectations of you seem to be unrealistic and it’s not up to you to set them straight.

"
9 may 2018,leo,"It’s time for some new habits, and today the cosmos calls for some changes in the way you think and process your emotions. If you habitually are feeling down, or jealous, or hung up on past dramas, now is auspicious for creating better thought patterns.

"
10 may 2018,leo,"Are you thinking with your head or your heart? Your ego or your logical left brain? Thinking could be muddled with a loopy lunar aspect. You’ll snap out of it within the next 24 hours, so avoid making big decisions today.

"
11 may 2018,leo,"Your determination to make over your life is rising as Uranus inches ever closer to Taurus, a sign it will enter next Tuesday. This is your house of ambition and success and nothing  is going to stop you. Today a superb Sun-Pluto aspect encourages you to sit down and create a list of everything you want to achieve between now and 2026. Consider this as New Years’ Eve on steroids.

"
13 may 2018,leo,"Got #goals? That’s going to be your mantra for the next eight years once Uranus glides into your ambition sector on Tuesday. Mercury zips in there today, stoking your brain with ideas. Yup, things are going to start happening quickly!

"
14 may 2018,leo,"Keep an open mind today, Leo. You’re a fixed sign, which means that you can resist change. But spunky Uranus is on a campaign to download some expansive ideas into that brain of yours, and they could be winners. Tomorrow Uranus moves on to your house of goals, a place it will be till 2026!

"
15 may 2018,leo,"Hope you’re well rested! Unconventional Uranus powers into your career and goals sector, shaking things up all the way into 2026. Chances are your life path will change dramatically, and you’ll be scoring wins that may have seemed unconceivable to you in the past.

"
16 may 2018,leo,"There is so much planetary energy going on in your ambition sector it’s making my head spin. Seriously, Leo, now’s the time to go after your heart’s desire! Spunky Uranus entered this sector yesterday and now there’s a new moon in the same house. Between now and November you should plow ahead and achieve as much as possible. Your efforts will pay off for years to come.

"
17 may 2018,leo,"Playing nice with others and being diplomatic will be difficult today, Leo! Now that spunky Uranus is in your goals sector, you’re becoming more focused on your own agenda, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Other people may try to pull you off track. Don’t let this happen.

"
18 may 2018,leo,"Procrastinating? Messy desk at home or work? Muffin top? Disciplined Saturn entered your house of habits and efficiency months ago, and it’s going to whip your sorry butt into shape. The good news is that the ringed planet forms a fabulous aspect today with intelligent Mercury, helping you to quickly move into a more productive mindset.

"
19 may 2018,leo,"Your sign is famous for its creativity and passion, and both of these attributes are about to increase. Lush Venus enters your house of romance and talent, a place it will remain for three weeks. You may feel the need to pull away from the crowd a little bit in order to devote more time to your skills and love life.

"
20 may 2018,leo,"The Sun has just entered your house of values and cherished dreams, placing some of your biggest desires on center stage. It would be smart to seek the wisdom from people who have traveled down a similar path before you. But be selective about whom you confide in as Venus is in your house of hush hush matters.

"
21 may 2018,leo,"A lot of times we procrastinate about making changes because we don’t feel like being forced into them. Even though we’re adults, we can feel as though some stern parent is out there, yelling at us to clean up our acts! Fortunately the Moon is in Leo today, actually making you want  to do this…for your own peace of mind.

"
22 may 2018,leo,"The Taurus season is your annual goal-a-thon, and brilliant little Mercury is stirring up your brain waves. If making more money (the serious kind) is on your agenda, know that your inspiration level will be high over the next week, not to mention your creativity. The full moon on the 29th could be a turning point in which you head off in an exciting and profitable new direction.

"
23 may 2018,leo,"Don’t get too cocky today, Leo. Abundant Jupiter may trick you into thinking you can move mountains. It’s one thing to be self-confident and another one to be unrealistic or overbearing. Friday is a better time for clarity.

"
24 may 2018,leo,"How well you cooperate with others is going to be an important factor over the next few weeks, Leo. You can often be a lone warrior, but sometimes ya just gotta play nice with others and feel like you’re part of a team. Fortunately a terrific Mars-Sun trine enables you to do so. Besides, you have wisdom that others can benefit from.

"
25 may 2018,leo,"Your mental and spiritual development are becoming more important to you as you realize that there’s more to life than swag and climbing the ladder. A magnificent and rare Jupiter-Neptune trine helps you dig down deep and find your own personal well of contentment and solitude. This aspect repeats again on August 19th, so use the time in between to develop a strong base.

"
26 may 2018,leo,"You have a lot more potential inside of you than you realize, something that the cosmos is trying to point out to you. One of the biggest themes running through your chart over the next few years is that you need to develop better habits and systems if you want to progress—and this includes your emotions too. Today is wonderful for stepping into a more influential place.

"
27 may 2018,leo,"Something (or someone) could tempt you to break a healthy new habit you’re developing, Leo. Maybe it’s that jelly donut that’s calling your name. Or the designer clothes you’re craving. Or a friend who’s urging you to toss back another margarita. Whatever it is, don’t succumb. You’re on a roll and need to develop even more momentum.

"
28 may 2018,leo,"Leos are a fixed sign, which means that you don’t like big changes happening. Your comfort level is based on things remaining the same. A Moon-Mercury opposition today could make you feel a bit off, as someone or something could rattle you. Tomorrow’s upcoming full moon in your house of drama isn’t helping! But this will all pass within a few days.

"
29 may 2018,leo,"An important new phase of your life opens up courtesy of tonight’s full moon. Expect new people to show up, people who can bring wisdom your way. There could also be new lovers, BFFs and partners in crime. Your creativity will sky rocket along the way, so embrace opportunities to develop your talents.

"
30 may 2018,leo,"The glow of yesterday’s full moon in the most dramatic, fun-filled part of your chart  is still there, Leo. But don’t become so starry-eyed that you become someone’s next target! This is true in any area of your life: romantically, financially, career, you name it. Keep a level head about you and don’t let anyone push you into anything.

"
31 may 2018,leo,"You don’t have to kill yourself to get ahead, Leo. Logical Saturn meets up with the Moon today, holding a discussion about your work load. You may think that you’re a bottomless pit of energy, but hello!!!! You’re not. The recent full moon occurred in your house of living la vida loca. It’s playtime, babe.

"
1 june 2018,leo,"Planets are active in your technology sector, Leo, suggesting that you up your internet game. We all rely on technology in one way or another, but in your case, learning how to finesse it can add to your efficiency and increase your income. It’s also a good time to find love online.

"
2 june 2018,leo,"Trust is something that is not easily earned, whether you’re learning to count on someone else or your own wisdom. A fortuitous Venus-Neptune aspect makes it easier for you to toss aside your fears and believe in yourself, as well as others.

"
3 june 2018,leo,"You can tend to be a solitary creature, not entirely trusting others. After all, you’re a fierce predator, and that attitude is built into your DNA! But planetary activity is pushing you to work more with others. Don’t worry, you’ll still maintain your autonomy.

"
4 june 2018,leo,"Coming into contact with the right kind of people becomes easier with today’s Sun-Mercury conjunction. You have what it takes, so much so that you run the risk of attracting wannabes or kiss asses who will try to impress you. Be choosy and take your time getting to know people.

"
5 june 2018,leo,"Sometimes you have to pick your battles, and today is one of those times, Leo. Someone with an attitude may try to push you around and your nature feline response will be to pounce and rip the dumb ass to shreds. But they’re not worth it, so let this pass.

"
6 june 2018,leo,"Murky Neptune is in a wonky mood from your house of wealth, which is something you need to watch out for. Be especially careful when it comes to trusting others, as they may try to mislead you. If possible, avoid making major financial decisions until the 13th, when profit-conscious Venus glides into Leo.

"
7 june 2018,leo,"Don’t succumb to envy today, Leo! Everyone is so busy making their lives look fab on social media, so it’s easy to fall into this trap. However, you can use envy to your advantage. It is often pointing out areas of our lives that are lacking, but it’s up to you to make those changes.

"
8 june 2018,leo,"The past few days may have been somewhat emo as confusing Neptune was acting up in your house of feelings. Clear the cobwebs out of your head and adjust your attitude (if that requires the aid of a cocktail or two, so be it!). The weekend is here and the Moon is in the most free-wheeling part of your chart.

"
9 june 2018,leo,"Nitpicking? According to your chart either you or someone close is getting way too particular! Yes, details are important, but sometimes you just have to look at the bigger picture.

"
10 june 2018,leo,"Momentum is developing in your life, Leo, but it may not be apparent right now. Interesting things are happening behind the scenes. Once Mercury changes signs on Tuesday you’ll start to get a glimpse of what’s happening.

"
11 june 2018,leo,"The planets are recommending that you just let certain things go, Leo. Your inner peace is too important a commodity to be upset by stupid people or situations. With shrewd Mercury touring the sector that governs your subconscious mind, you should be looking into mindfulness techniques and meditation.

"
12 june 2018,leo,"Hmmmm….does someone have a secret? It sure looks that way! Keep things on the hush-hush side, Leo, as chatty Mercury is now in your house of confidential matters. This may not be easy as glamorous Venus enters your sign tomorrow. Go the Mata Hari route: be charismatic, sexy and a total freakin’ mystery.

"
13 june 2018,leo,"Yeah, baby! It may not be your birthday season yet but the cosmos is getting the party started. Glam girl Venus glides into Leo, accompanied by a new moon in the house of friends and networking. This is one heck of an auspicious sign for showing off your bad self in a social setting, whether you’re looking for love or a new job. But don’t go overboard: Mercury is in your house of confidentiality, urging you to keep juicy tidbits to yourself.

"
14 june 2018,leo,"With magnetic Venus in your sign, you’re sure to attract a lot of attention. But not everyone will be happy about this, and they may decide to burst your bubble. I wish them luck. As long as you avoid the trolls, malcontents and divas you’ll be fine.

"
15 june 2018,leo,"You’re in a pretty vibey place these days, thanks to Mercury transiting your house of the subconscious mind. But keep your observations to yourself as Mercury opposes logical Saturn. Your psychic hits could be dead on, but you’ll be met with ridicule from people who think that the sixth sense is a load of bull.

"
16 june 2018,leo,"There is a LOT going on behind the scenes, Leo! From today through next Saturday you could become privy to some juicy intel. Your intuition is sharp, so use it to suss out what’s going on. Anything that you need to do confidentially, such as looking for a new job, should be done this week. Stealth is your MO after all!

"
17 june 2018,leo,"An attitude adjustment seems to be in order, Leo. Or perhaps I should say an “emotional realignment”. You don’t need to continue going through life reacting to everyone and everything with your typical knee jerk reactions. Pull away from the crowd and chill out.

"
18 june 2018,leo,"A very vibey, highly intuitive time begins as dreamy Neptune begins to retrograde in one of the most cerebral parts of your chart. Things will become even more intense as the Sun moves into Cancer on Thursday. Your intuition will be heightened but don’t act on it too quickly; use logic too, as Neptune can create mixed signals.

"
19 june 2018,leo,"Our internal sense of balance can be affected by so many factors, such as the state of our health, finances, love life and family connections. Something positive will happen today that will result in a greater feeling of calm and contentment. Other people around you may seem off balance, but you’ll be as solid as a rock.

"
20 june 2018,leo,"From your chart it appears that you have a number of things going on behind the scenes. This could be anything from a confidential job hunt to a secret crush to doing much needed inner work on your psyche. Today is a wonderful time to make progress, so set aside time for whatever it is. Once the Sun enters Cancer tomorrow things will pick up speed.

"
21 june 2018,leo,"It’s time to hole up in your lair, Leo! Not only is the Sun now in the most secluded part of your chart, a Venus-Mars opposition today finds you questioning just how much “together time” you really want to spend with other people. Over the next few weeks you may choose to hang out with only trusted friends or family members, people who you know have your back.

"
22 june 2018,leo,"Brilliant Uranus is now in your career sector for the first time in over 80 years, and it’s going to be around for awhile! But things heat up today with a sparkling Sun-Uranus aspect. Someone may be working on your behalf behind the scenes. Or maybe you hit upon a genius idea for a business, or how to score a promotion. When Mercury enters your money house on the 29th, it’s time to move ahead with these opportunities.

"
23 june 2018,leo,"You’re a fearless lion and not the kind to sit back and let others be the boss, but that’s exactly what you should do today. Let others prance around and act important. They’ll be doing that all of next week too, so get used to it. You’re better off doing your own thing quietly, behind the scenes.

"
24 june 2018,leo,"You’ve been biting off more than you can chew, so slow down a bit, Leo! Yes, there may be lots of things you want to get done in a day but you run the risk of burning out. The full moon on Thursday will help you become more efficient.

"
25 june 2018,leo,"Playing by somebody else’s rules has never been your strong point, and today you’ll feel it big time! Others may resort to (empty) promises or try to flatter you, but don’t fall for it. There’s a time and place to cooperate and now isn’t that time….which is too bad for them!

"
26 june 2018,leo,"Just how much togetherness do you need in a relationship, Leo? Activity in your chart indicates that you may be craving more alone time over the next few weeks. If anyone is too clingy or demanding you’ll be tempted to silence them with a mighty roar. You need a team player, not someone who needs a baby sitter.

"
27 june 2018,leo,"You’re about to break free from some confining situations, and you’ll be able to breathe a sigh of relief. But not everyone around you will be pleased that you’re on the verge of moving ahead, so keep an eye out for malcontents who may try to stall your progress.

"
28 june 2018,leo,"Ready to move on to better working conditions, perhaps even a new job? The full moon in Capricorn could bring about positive new changes for you, and heaven knows you deserve them. But there could be hidden resistance from someone, so stay on your toes.

"
29 june 2018,leo,"Yaasss!!! Your birthday season comes a little early as vivacious Mercury zips into Leo. The next few weeks are awesome for showing off what you’ve got, whether that’s in a personal setting or a business one. You’re in a practical mood these days and ready to dig into new projects, and people will notice your can-do attitude.

"
30 june 2018,leo,"It may be the weekend but the planets are focused on your career and workplace. Flexibility is going to be required between now and Tuesday, as unpredictable Uranus will be stirring things up. The smartest thing you can do is to lay low and act like a team player.

"
1 july 2018,leo,"With glamorous Venus in your sign until the 9th, you should be working on a makeover, which includes fitness of course! A strong Pluto-Venus aspect encourages you to create better habits. The good news is that you’ll be able to stick to them.

"
2 july 2018,leo,"Some big changes on the work front are happening, and they may require some adjustments from you. More responsibility could come your way, but the good news is that this will put you in a stronger position career wise. The decisions you make will have long lasting effects, so choose wisely.

"
3 july 2018,leo,"It’s a wonderful day for getting emotions out in the open. This naturally applies to you, but it could also mean that you’ll end up being a good friend to someone else who needs to vent. There is a terrific healing energy going on into next week, and it’s going to magnify once Jupiter goes direct on the 10th.

"
4 july 2018,leo,"Your sign loves love and loves the good life, and you’re in the mood for some fun escapades! A juicy Moon-Neptune aspect could bring you some delights….just make sure that they don’t cost too much!

"
5 july 2018,leo,"As a fixed sign you tend to get set in your ways, and that includes the way you think. From your chart it appears that you really need to do a mental “cleansing”. Don’t be too proud to think that you’re above it; even a lion needs to recalibrate their brains now and then.

"
6 july 2018,leo,"You’ll be in no mood today if others try to tell you what to do. But fortunately, silver-tongued Mercury is in your sign, so instead of ripping them a new one, you’ll be able to politely tell them to back off.

"
7 july 2018,leo,"The next week is going to be a big one, in part due to a solar eclipse on the 13th in your house of endings. Today you might start getting fidgety about your career or another big goal, but this is a good sign. You need a major change, and in order to do so, the old garbage has to go.

"
8 july 2018,leo,"This is the best time all year to do some serious inner work, Leo. The Sun and Neptune are conspiring today to bring you greater peace and contentment. Consider the possibilities: mindfulness meditation, Zen Buddhism, joining a support group or getting involved at your church. .

"
9 july 2018,leo,"There’s a lot going on behind the scenes this week, Leo. Today profitable Venus glides into your house of earning more money. The time is right for conducting research and making quiet inquiries. Keep everything hush-hush, especially at the time of the eclipse on Friday.

"
10 july 2018,leo,"This week there are a lot of planetary aspects designed to make you feel more comfortable in your own skin, Leo. A fabulous one occurs today as healing Jupiter goes direct in your house of contentment. It’s time to start dwelling in your own private temple of peace and serenity, metaphorically speaking.

"
11 july 2018,leo,"Do you truly love what you do for living, Leo? If you do, then a happy Venus aspect should help you find even more enjoyment in your career. But if you’re not thrilled to pieces, a surprising and positive development could occur. Be on the lookout for a new opportunity that could come from left field.

"
12 july 2018,leo,"The dreams and plans that you hold most dear may end up getting challenged by other people today, Virgo. Actually, they could put up resistance for several weeks. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse falls in your house of cherished dreams and closely held values. Don’t compromise anything that is important to you to keep other people happy.

"
13 july 2018,leo,"Adios! Buh-bye! Don’t let the door hit you on the rear on the way out. Yeah, it’s time to take out the trash. A solar eclipse in your house of closure and transition sets the stage for clearing out the cobwebs from your life. That includes negative people, bad habits and anything else that maybe holding you back. You won’t be sorry to see them go.

"
14 july 2018,leo,"Yesterdays solar eclipse fell in your house of habits, Leo. It’s time to dive headlong into a new series of routines. With take-it-easy Venus in a good spot, this should take place more quickly than you may realize.

"
15 july 2018,leo,"Yesterday’s eclipse occurred in your house of closure and moving on, Leo. And the action starts right away! You might want to start with your financial situation and your career. Don’t settle for earning less than you deserve, or being stifled by a job that doesn’t suit you. Start making other plans.

"
16 july 2018,leo,"Your birthday season is almost here, and the one thing that you probably crave more than anything else is stability. You’re a fixed sign, which means that you desire strength and knowing what’s going on. But this feeling is amplified as Venus is cruising through your second house of ritual and security. Drama is not your thing right now.

"
17 july 2018,leo,"Situations that may not have worked out well in the past could be affecting your current confidence level, Leo. But just because you’ve dealt with some disappointments does not mean that they are going to continue. Once the Sun enters your sign next Sunday your attitude will improve dramatically.

"
18 july 2018,leo,"The Sun is getting ready to enter your sign, and you’re getting ready to claim what is yours! You are determined to do something worthwhile with your life, and small minded people are starting to get on your nerves. Leave them in the dust, Leo. You’ve got bigger fish to fry.

"
19 july 2018,leo,"Watch that you don’t say the wrong thing to the wrong person, Leo. Right now you need to come off as a team player. I know that this goes against your typical regal attitude, but if you roar too loudly you could offend someone is a decision-maker.

"
20 july 2018,leo,"It seems like you’ve been putting plenty of time and effort into a project with strong long-term possibilities, Leo. Keep at it! The Sun enters your sign in two days, and then all systems will be go.

"
21 july 2018,leo,"Just one more day until the Sun enters your sign! The cosmos delivers an early birthday present your way, with a happy aspect between the two most beneficial planets, Venus and Jupiter. They are in houses that deal with stability, the emotional kind and the financial kind. Gotta love it!

"
22 july 2018,leo,"Yaasss!!!! Pop open a bottle of champagne and toast yourself, Leo. The Sun is now in your sign. Chances are you’re ready to chase after some new adventures and initiatives. But slow down and think things through, as Mercury will retrograde in Leo this Thursday.

"
23 july 2018,leo,"Your emotions could get the better of you today, Leo. The emotional Moon is in the most dramatic part of your chart, and it is in a tense angle with deceptive Neptune. People could push your buttons very easily. Or you could create your own tempest in a teapot. Its birthday season, babe…why are you all in a lather?

"
24 july 2018,leo,"Relying on emotions alone is not the way to go today, Leo. A Venus-Neptune opposition could find you thinking with your heart instead of your head. You need to get clear about certain situations, especially because Mercury is about to go retrograde in your sign on Thursday.

"
25 july 2018,leo,"You might pull a 180 when it comes to your deepest dreams and desires, Leo. Erratic Uranus is active, stirring up your brain to come up with even better and more audacious plans. But not everyone may be on board with this, including you! Don’t let fear hold you back.

"
26 july 2018,leo,"Is it time for Leo 2.0? The cosmos seems to think so. Yes, the fiery Sun is now in your sign, illuminating your most cherished desires. But Mercury retrogrades today in your sign, suggesting that you reconsider your alternatives. There’s nothing wrong with overhauling your plans.

"
27 july 2018,leo,"Just how much independence do you need in your life, Leo? Right now it may be a lot. The issue at hand is that today’s lunar eclipse falls in your house of partnering. Someone may want to form deeper bonds with you, personally or professionally. Are you ready to take the plunge?

"
28 july 2018,leo,"The Sun is in your sign, and naturally it’s your time to dream! No doubt you’re hatching some fabulous new plans for the year ahead. Today is an excellent time to get started on them, as Venus and Pluto meet up in two of the most practical parts of your chart. Coming up with strategies (and even the money) to make things happen becomes much easier.

"
29 july 2018,leo,"Mercury may be retrograde in your sign, but that doesn’t mean that your thoughts are off target. The problem is that other people may think so. You can take this personally, or you could just laugh it off and keep doing what you were going to do anyhow!

"
30 july 2018,leo,"It will be hard to hide your feelings today, thanks to a Moon-Jupiter connection. But this is a positive thing! There is nothing wrong with letting people know what you’re thinking. After all, the Sun is in your sign. It’s your birthday season and you should be asking for what you want.

"
31 july 2018,leo,"Maintaining a steady cash flow is always important to the luxe loving lion. And today you may hit upon some awesome ideas for building up your income. From your chart, it appears that you may find a passive income opportunity that  could pay off nicely.

"
1 august 2018,leo,"What you want and what somebody else wants are probably going to be two different things. You could let this turn into the mother of all arguments, or just agree to disagree. From your chart it looks like you’re going to do things your own way anyhow. So why bother getting into a lather about this?

"
2 august 2018,leo,"It’s time to spruce up your lair, lion. With the moon and the most creative part of your chart, you should be thinking about ways to freshen up your place. Try to do this before the solar eclipse in your sign on the 11th. Things will really start popping after then, and you may not have the time for interior design.

"
3 august 2018,leo,"You could be confused today about which direction to head in. It’s not surprising, really. With the Sun in your sign, you are uncovering plenty of options that are appealing to you. Don’t try to make a decision now. This energy is going to continue all the way through the eclipse on the 11th.

"
4 august 2018,leo,"Brilliant Uranus is in your house of goals and career success for the first time in over 80 years. Today, it’s stirring up all sorts of ideas in your head. Scribble them down on a piece of paper. When Uranus retrogrades next Tuesday, that’s the time to start considering your options.

"
5 august 2018,leo,"Things that are old and outdated need to go, Leo. With detective-like Pluto in your house of productivity, you need to get your act together. Once the solar eclipse arrives in your sign on Saturday the 11th, you’ll be way too busy to take care of these kinds of things.

"
6 august 2018,leo,"Gotta love it! You are the celestial favorite with the Sun in your sign, and then today Venus glides into your house of socializing and self-expression. The next few weeks are awesome for getting your message out there, whatever that message may be. Meeting new people is also in the stars, and this includes a new love interest.

"
7 august 2018,leo,"Uranus is the planet that helps you become recognized as a trailblazer, thanks to its ability to produce avant-garde ideas. Today it goes retrograde, but this is not something to be upset about. Over the next few months you could come up with some big ideas with serious long-term potential. Don’t dismiss them.

"
8 august 2018,leo,"The summer Sun is sizzling north of the equator, and so is your love life! With the two cosmic lovers, Mars and Venus, in a fabulous aspect romance heats up nicely. You are at your charismatic best!

"
9 august 2018,leo,"You won’t be in the mood for fuzzy promises or unclear situations. Planets in the most practical parts of your chart are demanding answers. Successful long-term planning is critical right now. Saturday’s solar eclipse in your sign will open up many new doors; you need to know which ones to go through.

"
10 august 2018,leo,"Are you ready? Tomorrow’s solar eclipse occurs in your sign, highlighting all of your biggest dreams. But make sure that you’re following your own path and not someone else’s. Others may try to get you to buy into their plan. Not happening!

"
11 august 2018,leo,"Yeah, baby! A sparkling solar eclipse occurs in your sign. Ready for a personal makeover? Want to show off a brand-new attitude? Maybe you want to chase after some dreams that have been calling your name for years. Now is the time, and you can make an awful lot of progress by February 2019.

"
12 august 2018,leo,"Yesterday a solar eclipse occurred in your sign. And naturally, you’re thinking about all sorts of juicy plans! But before you can launch anything, it’s imperative to get caught up on old chores and projects. This may not be what you want to hear, but Mars retrogrades today into your house of productivity. If you want to conquer the world, first you need to develop better habits and systems.

"
13 august 2018,leo,"Things could be a little murky today in both love and your finances, Leo. That’s because foggy Neptune is swirling its mist in your house of wealth and intimacy. The good news is that tomorrow your mind will be as sharp as a tack. Wait until then to make decisions.

"
14 august 2018,leo,"Considering that the recent solar eclipse fell in your sign, the world is now your oyster! You can go after any dream of your choosing. A Venus-Moon aspect today is perfect for meeting new people and socializing, and this includes finding new love. It’s also a great date night, one of the best all week.

"
15 august 2018,leo,"Today you are going to have to balance mixing business with pleasure. Yes, the job has to get done. But from your chart it also looks like you need some downtime! It’s your birthday season, babe. Don’t forget to shake that mane and roar.

"
16 august 2018,leo,"Someone may be unusually assertive with you today, and it might rattle your cage. But this is just a short lived drama. Let it go. By tomorrow, you’re feeling content and comfortable within your own skin.

"
17 august 2018,leo,"You have a lot on your plate, so much that you maybe feeling a bit overwhelmed. But that’s because Mercury is retrograde in your sign. It stations direct on Sunday, so once that happens you’ll feel more confident. The planets recommend that you get your home organized today, as you won’t have much time for that soon.

"
18 august 2018,leo,"Damn, you look good. And the words coming from your mouth to charm the birds from the trees. It’s pretty sweet to be a Leo today, thanks to chatty Mercury and magnetic Venus forming a fabulous aspect. And Mercury is retrograde, thank you very much. But it goes direct tomorrow, so things should only get better.

"
19 august 2018,leo,"Your birthday season ain’t over yet, and you’re not going to let the Sun leave without a few fireworks! The good news is that high wattage Mercury goes direct today in your sign. All of the escapades you’ve been planning, the world domination, the makeover…it’s time to launch.  You’ve had time to strategize; now is the moment for action.

"
20 august 2018,leo,"Ready to purr? With a generous Jupiter winking at amorous Neptune, this is a perfect time to let someone know how you feel. Things could get quite emo, but in a happy way.

"
21 august 2018,leo,"You mean business, and I feel sorry for anyone who gets in your way! But chances are that won’t happen, so spend today getting organized and plan your next move. You may have to do some research first, and tomorrow’s energy is perfect for that.

"
22 august 2018,leo,"You may need to step in and take charge of a situation that is going off the rails, whether you feel like it or not. The problem is, if you don’t, you’ll end up getting the short end of the stick. Let other people know that you mean business and you know how to get things done.

"
23 august 2018,leo,"Okay, lion. Birthday time is officially over. The Sun is now in Virgo and it’s time for you to start making mo’ money. The next four weeks are some of the best in 2018 for ratcheting up your income. Over the next five days, you should be reviewing your habits: not only when it comes to spending and saving, but also how you get your job done. Is it time to start a side hustle or move to another place of employment?

"
24 august 2018,leo,"If you’ve been slacking off, the party is over! Motivational Mars meets up with the Moon in the most productive part of your chart today. Whether you want to slim down and tone up, or get your house in order, the time is now. Once Mars goes direct on Monday you will be even more motivated to get things done.

"
25 august 2018,leo,"You’ve been working hard and people have taken notice. Now that the Sun is in your house of making more money, you should be able to cash in on your efforts. Over the next two weeks something unexpected (but good!) could happen, so get ready to talk about raises and business deals.

"
26 august 2018,leo,"Tonight the cosmos delivers the annual full moon in your house of intimacy and emotional depth. You should be more than ready to commit to loving someone, which means that a relationship can take flight. So can a budding romance. But don’t forget to take loving care of yourself too, which means doing some important inner work.

"
27 august 2018,leo,"Over the past few weeks it may have become obvious to you that you desperately needed to get your sh** together. This isn’t so much about your mental state but getting caught up on mundane tasks and work projects. Now that Mars has gone direct in your house of organization and efficiency, you can start to feel as though your on top of things again—as long as you’re willing to do the grunt work necessary!

"
28 august 2018,leo,"With intelligent, rational Mercury in your sign you are looking at the world through a clear lens. But other people may be tugging at you, trying to sway you to their way of thinking. Or maybe it’s a little voice in your own head that wants you to stick with the past, as uncomfortable as it may have been! Stick with the logical left side of your brain on this one.

"
29 august 2018,leo,"Now that ambitious Mars is direct in your house of efficiency, you should be figuring out how to get things done in less time. You need more play time, period. Start by taking control of your schedule and not allowing other people to waste valuable hours (or even minutes!) of your life.

"
30 august 2018,leo,"Things may not go according to plan today, so leave early, back up your files and be prepared for people switching their plans. Mercury isn’t retrograde but things could still get screwed up!

"
31 august 2018,leo,"There could be an unexpected turn in career matters, something that speeds up your plans. You’ve got everything going for you right now: the Sun in your house of income, energetic Mars in your efficiency sector, shrewd Mercury in Leo, and revolutionary Uranus in your house of ambition. Don’t waste this energy!

"
1 september 2018,leo,"With intelligent Mercury in your sign, your brain should be popping with ideas. That’s the good news. The bad news is that you are either (a) spreading yourself too thin or (b) chasing after people or situations that don’t reflect your core values. Be selective.

"
2 september 2018,leo,"Your values may be changing, Leo, and this is a good thing. Settling for life’s table scraps has never suited a regal person like yourself. Don’t be afraid to expect more….and then get it.

"
3 september 2018,leo,"The time has come to commit, Leo. It’s time to start doing all of the things you’ve been promising to do: lose weight, save more money, stop thinking negatively, whatever. It may seem daunting but the end result will put a huge smile on your face. Stop procrastinating and begin.

"
4 september 2018,leo,"This is no time to be a maverick at the office, Leo. Slap a smile on your face and play by the rules. Your career is about to take off and you’ll have more say-so when it comes to your working conditions, so suck it up for now.

"
5 september 2018,leo,"Show me the money! If you’re looking to earn more (who isn’t?) then you’re in luck. Shrewd Mercury is now in your earnings sector, helping you land more cash. And tomorrow Saturn goes direct in your productivity sector, turning you into an efficiency machine. Nothing is going to stop you.

"
6 september 2018,leo,"Life is about to become saner and more organized. Logical Saturn has been retrograde for the past few months in your house of efficiency, encouraging you to create better habits. Hopefully you have. Now it’s time to reap the rewards: less stress, a more serene environment and even better health and fitness.

"
7 september 2018,leo,"This is one of the best days all month… or maybe all year!…to make headway with your income and career. In astrology, there are three houses that govern your occupation and success. Planets are lining up in all three, in a beautiful way. Don’t be afraid to do something a little unexpected. Things could work out better than you might imagine.

"
8 september 2018,leo,"All talk no action? If that describes you, things need to change. Energetic Mars is in your house of efficiency, determined to get things done. It’s time to stop dreaming and talking about things. As the saying goes, “Just do it.”

"
9 september 2018,leo,"It’s time that you start to build a more stable base, Leo—both financially and emotionally. Fortunately today’s new moon occurs in your house of earning more income. And gentle Venus glides into your house of contentment and feeling at ease. If you need to do some inner work to release negativity, you are in a fabulous place to stick to new habits, like meditation or journaling.

"
10 september 2018,leo,"If you’re ready to lock in a serious romance, the cosmos is ready for you. High-octane Mars moves into your house of commitment today. Sometimes this aspect can create arguments and jealousy. But other planets are in a peace loving mood, demanding stability and maturity. This means that both you and  a lover need to act like grownups.

"
11 september 2018,leo,"You may be concerned about your cash situation, but today’s aspects are terrific for solidifying your foundation. Are you willing first to examine your habits about spending and saving? With deep diving Pluto in your house of routines, you should be taking an honest look. Then start considering how you can earn more. Tomorrow could bring a brilliant idea, thanks to genius Uranus.

"
12 september 2018,leo,"What counts most these days is inner peace. Feeling healthy and physically vibrant is important too. Do what it takes to get your body and mind in alignment. If this means ignoring the outside world to a certain extent, so be it.

"
13 september 2018,leo,"Emotions could be a bit raw today, either on your part or the part of people in your environment. And people may not be exactly forthright either. As a result, you’d be wise to avoid known perpetrators, or anyone who seems to be talking in circles. Let your own intelligence and intuition be your guide.

"
14 september 2018,leo,"It seems like everyone is in a snit today and that you can’t keep anyone happy. Don’t let this interrupt the flow of your precious chi. Right now you need to remain focused. If that means just worrying about yourself, so be it!

"
15 september 2018,leo,"Why do we habitually do the things that we do? Our subconscious mind gets stuck in a groove, and it can be difficult to get out of them sometimes. But not today, not for you. Break out of old routines and embrace new ones. You’re in a highly productive phase right now. Make the changes, because later this month you’ll be more interested in just having fun!

"
16 september 2018,leo,"If you want to start putting aside some money for your home, now is a good time to start. This could be the down payment on a house or just a few bucks for a new duvet. This is one of the best years in over a decade to feather your nest, but that always costs money! Figure out how to build your income or cut expenses.

"
17 september 2018,leo,"You’re getting a lot more serious about creating better habits, and the good news is that they’re going to pay off. “Discipline” is an uncomfortable word for a lot of people. The reality is that it sets you free. Less stress, better health, more money in the bank, a fitter body….who doesn’t want that?

"
18 september 2018,leo,"This is not a good day to mouth off to someone, Leo, especially if they wield any influence. You maybe sick and tired of being a team player, but still you need to play the game for little while longer. The full moon arriving on the 24th is a wonderful opportunity for you to start doing things your way.

"
19 september 2018,leo,"The Sun will be leaving your house of income and savings within the next few days. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t make progress. As a matter fact, today is wonderful for putting the finishing touches on ideas that will increase your cash flow. Once the Sun moves into Libra this weekend, it’s time to start promoting your ideas.

"
20 september 2018,leo,"It’s time to recharge your batteries, Leo. No, really. Anyone who thinks that you are a languid lion has not been paying attention to how much work you’ve been doing lately. The Sun is ready to enter the most social part of your chart. You deserve some fun, so rest up now.

"
21 september 2018,leo,"The speed of life is going to start to pick up over the next four weeks, Leo. You could be busy zipping around the neighborhood getting errands done. Networking with people will be important too, whether it’s for fun or business. Your vitality looks like it might be a little low according to your chart, so rest up now.

"
22 september 2018,leo,"Rules? What rules? Now that the Sun is in the most social part of your chart, you may just feel like having fun. And there’s nothing wrong with that, as long as you remember that you have to get some work done. Go ahead: flirt, go out for drinks with your friends, network with colleagues, and go away on some short trips. But you can also schmooze for business purposes too.

"
23 september 2018,leo,"You need to start walking the walk and talking the talk, Leo. This goes for diets and exercise programs. It includes the way you talk to people and the way you think. Staying on top of projects, both at home and at work, is super important. Stop procrastinating and get things done already.
 

"
24 september 2018,leo,"If there is any sign of the zodiac that is ready to bust out of limiting conditions, it’s you. Tonight’s full moon is just the ticket for doing so! The problem is, you may be focusing on so many little details that you can’t see the big picture. Or you’re so hard at work that you don’t believe that you’ll ever move on. You can, and you will.

"
25 september 2018,leo,"People could really be stuck in “group think” mode today. And if you try to offer your opinion or bright ideas, they could get shot down. Not to worry. They need you a lot more than you need them. Push forward with your own agenda!

"
26 september 2018,leo,"You should be feeling more lighthearted and comfortable in your skin, Leo. The Moon is currently in the most optimistic part of your chart, encouraging you to let go of emotional baggage. It’s time to chase after some new dreams without anything holding you back.

"
27 september 2018,leo,"This is a wonderful day for developing stronger relationships with others, Leo. It’s also a good time for meeting new people, the kind of people who can be in your life for years to come. But nothing’s going to happen if you’re hiding out in your lair. Make the effort!

"
28 september 2018,leo,"Anyone who thinks that you are not up to a particular task is in for a big surprise. This includes you, Leo! Don’t let fears or low self-esteem get in your way. Once you get going, you may realize that things are far easier than you expected.

"
30 september 2018,leo,"We all need to assess our values from time to time. With the Moon in the part of your chart that deals with your most cherished dreams, you should be considering what’s most important to you—now. Quit being sentimental about old plans or goals. Change is in the air, and it’s for the better.

"
1 october 2018,leo,"Be careful what you say and do, Leo. The moon is in the moodiest part of your chart, stirring up all sorts of thoughts. The smartest thing that you can do right now is to put a smile on your face and play the game, something that doesn’t sit well with your proud sign! But you do understand stealth, and that’s the way you need to act right now–quiet and deadly!

"
2 october 2018,leo,"When playing high-stakes poker, you need to keep your cards close to your vest. And the term “poker face” is around for a reason. Today, say little…observe a lot…and give nothing away. Be inscrutable. Knowledge is power.

"
3 october 2018,leo,"Heavens, do you need a break. From your chart it looks like you have one nerve left and everyone is working it. Today is perfect for some extreme self-care so don’t feel guilty about pampering yourself. Or maybe you just need to do a little bit of meditation and inner work. Do whatever it takes.

"
4 october 2018,leo,"Your fearless sign is not known for hiding its emotions or game plan. Why bother? After all, you’re the fiercest predator in the cosmos. But a tense Moon-Uranus suggests that you play it coy today. So pull back the claws and act like a cute little fuzzy bunny rabbit. Don’t worry, you can go back to your usual self soon.

"
5 october 2018,leo,"You’re always so proud and fierce that many people don’t realize that even Leos can suffer from a lack of confidence. And that’s exactly what might happen between now and Halloween, thanks to Venus going retro in moody Scorpio. Quit being so emo. Royalty knows how to rise above petty crap. (Just look at how Meghan Markle deals with her crazy ass sister.)

"
6 october 2018,leo,"Dream houses, designer clothes, trips around the world, a big juicy retirement account—where the hell are they? That’s what you may be thinking today as you ogle the goodies that others have. When is it going to be your turn? Sooner than you may think. But this isn’t going to come from a winning lottery ticket; it’s all about the hustle.

"
7 october 2018,leo,"You’re a Leo, and you deserve the best. That’s understood! So why are you settling for less? Come on, get your act together. It’s time to own  that regal lion persona.

"
8 october 2018,leo,"The new Moon in Libra is the perfect time for you to express yourself, Leo. Brainstorm with other people. Plan a social media blitz. Flirt like crazy. Revamp your brand. There is one warning, however: don’t challenge authority too much. You’ll be able to get your way, but only if you play it cool.

"
9 october 2018,leo,"Your ability to communicate with others will skyrocket now that Mercury is in Scorpio. Creating more cooperative relationships with people, both in your personal and professional life, is possible. You may not feel this on Wednesday and Friday of this week, but you’ll be able to make progress before the month is out.

"
10 october 2018,leo,"People could be critical today. They could be forceful, erratic. It will be easy to lash out in anger, taking a nip at them with those teeth of yours. Don’t go there, no matter how tempting it is. Maintaining calm and balanced is far more important.

"
11 october 2018,leo,"Try to get ahead of tasks and projects: your sanity depends on it. This includes your home life as well as work. A positive Moon-Pluto aspect is helpful for creating a home office or a business you can run on the side.

"
12 october 2018,leo,"You know what you need to do. You have your day all planned out. You have an end goal in mind. All the more reason to not let others throw you off track with their incessant demands. Politely avoid them and do your own thing.

"
13 october 2018,leo,"Your moods have been thrown all over the place recently by people playing games and events that are out of your control. But once the Moon enters steady, calm Capricorn tomorrow, your mind will settle down. One of the best things to do at times like this is to stick to old routines and habits. They will provide comfort.

"
14 october 2018,leo,"OK Leo, are you ready to get serious? I’m referring to sticking to your plans and habits. Right now you’re having a New-Year’s-Day-in-October kind of a situation going on. Wise, mature Saturn is kicking you in the butt, encouraging you to develop some discipline. You’ll be glad later on that you did.

"
15 october 2018,leo,"Awwww!! Today’s looking sentimental and mushy due to a Venus-Mercury aspect. Take a break to enjoy some quality time with a loved one (which includes you!), as the next few days are demanding that you bang out work and errands.

"
16 october 2018,leo,"You really need to find a better way to deal with co-workers and your tasks, Leo. If you don’t you’ll end up running yourself ragged. Once the Sun enters Scorpio next week, your need for serenity will grow even stronger. But just chanting a mantra isn’t going to do it!

"
17 october 2018,leo,"If you need to patch things up with someone, the next three days are a good time to do so. That said, don’t let anyone guilt you into doing something that you’re not thrilled about. It’s one thing to keep the peace, and another to sell your soul.

"
18 october 2018,leo,"From your chart it appears that you’ve been spreading yourself too thin, especially when it comes to meeting the demands of others. If too many people are pulling on you, you may need to make a choice about whom you’re going to help. Besides, some of these people can take care of their own problems.

"
19 october 2018,leo,"It’s imperative that you are clear about money matters. There could be some enticing investments or job opportunities in front of you. But before you dive in, do your homework. This is especially true if you are going to have a partner or spouse involved in a fiscal decision.

"
20 october 2018,leo,"Love and money. The two areas of life that most people care about the most. You will be thinking about them today, thanks to inspirational Neptune active in a house that governs both. Today is a day to dream rather than think about the nuts and bolts of situations. Save the reality checks for the time of next Wednesday’s full moon.

"
21 october 2018,leo,"It’s a wonderful day to feel comfortable in your own skin! What this means is that you don’t have to be troubled by the opinions of others. Nor should you worry about the dramas that they insist on creating. Go your own way, Leo.

"
22 october 2018,leo,"Over the next four weeks, you can settle into a comfortable new groove. You have some big decisions to make about the direction your life is heading in, and the full moon on Wednesday is the best time to do so. After that, peace will be yours. You’ll be on the right track.

"
23 october 2018,leo,"You are SO fed up with drama and chaos. And now that the fiery Sun, your ruler, is in your house of quiet contentment, you will become determined to find peace. If your job or line or work is less than fulfilling, that may be the best place to start right now.

"
24 october 2018,leo,"Tonight brings your annual full moon in the goals sector. Let’s put it this way, Leo: if you have things that you’d like to accomplish by year’s end, start hustling. And if you’re not happy with certain aspects of your life, it’s time for some serious inner reflection. It’s important that you are at peace with your decisions.

"
25 october 2018,leo,"Try your best to get ahead with your work at the office. And while you’re at it, do the same with that to-do list at home. The cosmos is pushing you to wrap things up so that you’ll start to feel more serene. The longer the to-do list, the more stressed you’ll be.

"
26 october 2018,leo,"The weekend is almost here and the cosmos is telling you to focus on your home environment. If your lair is looking a wee bit….shabby, then it’s time for a little makeover. Clean up the clutter, get some fresh air in the place, and go shopping for gorgeous new stuff.

"
27 october 2018,leo,"This past year has been full of very “settling” energy. Leos have been encouraged to create a happy home environment, and security in their jobs. But things are starting to loosen up. It’s time to start living la vida loca–are you ready?

"
28 october 2018,leo,"Recharge your batteries today, Leo. With healing Jupiter and gentle Venus in your domestic sector, this would be a good time to relax at home. If you decide to go out with friends, keep things low key. Once Mercury changes signs on Wednesday, you’ll be ready to paint the town red.

"
29 october 2018,leo,"Be sure to show your loved ones just how much you care. A lovely meeting between verbal Mercury and healing Jupiter is setting the stage for creating more peace and love. While you’re at it, make sure that you take very good care of yourself!

"
30 october 2018,leo,"Buddha said that we become what we think about. Keep that in mind as you go through your day. The trolls and malcontents may be out there, but you can’t let them ruin your state of mind. Treat your mind as though it is a holy temple, something that will not be defiled.

"
31 october 2018,leo,"Planetary activity today will send your emotions into a tizzy. And the problem is that Venus starts to retrograde in your communication sector. As a result, you run the risk of saying something you shouldn’t. Let this tempest in a teapot pass, which should take a few days.

"
1 november 2018,leo,"Planetary activity in the most sensitive part of your chart is making you focus on peace of mind. Seriously, you have to get to the bottom of what’s bothering you. Is it truly worth being upset about? If not, make peace with it and move on.

"
2 november 2018,leo,"People could be playing on your emotions, so pay attention to what they’re saying and doing. Fortunately the Moon is in the most practical part of your chart, and you should be able to see through this nonsense. Wait until early next week before saying or doing anything.

"
4 november 2018,leo,"It’s time to be carefree and playful, Leo. Over the past few weeks life may have seemed like a grind. You deserve to be happy. And when generous Jupiter enters your house fun and romance on Thursday, there is even more joy on the horizon.

"
5 november 2018,leo,"Sometimes when planets move on from a sign, they leave a gift in our laps. Jupiter is getting ready to glide into Sagittarius on Thursday. It spends three more days in your house of contentment and security. One of the gifts it may give you is peace of mind, if you are willing to receive it.

"
6 november 2018,leo,"Don’t be surprised if you decide to take a step back and rework some of your plans, Leo. That’s because brilliant Uranus retrogrades into your house of taking risks. This is actually a valuable aspect, as you could uncover new ways of doing things. Naturally things will be delayed, but the end result will be so wonderful you’ll be happy that you took the time to consider your options.

"
7 november 2018,leo,"Mighty Jupiter will be leaving your house of home, family and inner peace tomorrow. But a sparkling new moon today in this sector grants you another six months of help. Pluto is active in your house of organization, urging you to catch up on old tasks and declutter. A decluttered house will lead to a more serene mind.

"
8 november 2018,leo,"Oh, yeah! All of you lions out there should be happier than a pig in mud. Generous Jupiter glides into your house of creativity, fun and romance. The gas giant has not been in this part of your charts in over a decade. Your talents can soar through the roof. New love can enter your life, or you could conceive a baby. Hitting the town and enjoying culture will become more important you than ever before. Cheers!

"
9 november 2018,leo,"There are times when you need to speak up and this is one of them. The good news is that gentle Venus is in your house of communication. You should be able to speak your piece without ruffling anyone’s feathers. Serious talks with a lover are well aspected today, FYI.

"
10 november 2018,leo,"Everyone thinks that Leos are larger than life characters. And in truth, maybe they are! But you know deep down that sometimes you just don’t feel so fabulous. That’s okay. Over the next 13 months, your going to get your mojo back.

"
11 november 2018,leo,"You’ve been pushing hard lately, way too hard. A healing Sun-Pluto aspect recommends that you recharge your batteries. Life can’t be all about work and responsibility. Be good to yourself.

"
12 november 2018,leo,"You need to change the way you get things done, Leo. Even if you think that you are quite efficient, there is always room for improvement. Besides, the more effort you put into it this, the faster you’ll feel relieved…..and less stressed.

"
13 november 2018,leo,"This is a great day to make sure that you’re on the same page with other people, both at work and in your personal life. The cosmic lines of communication are wide open. But once Mercury goes retrograde on Friday, there could be—as they say in Hollywood— “creative differences.”

"
15 november 2018,leo,"Got the fire down below?! Now that Mars is in the sexiest part of your chart, you could be ready to steam things up in the boudoir. But the problem is that Mercury goes retrograde tomorrow in your house of romance. This means that you could be blinded by your libido, not paying attention to what’s really going on in a relationship. Remain aware.

"
16 november 2018,leo,"Lucky Jupiter entered your house of romance, fun and creativity back on the 8th. This is big news, because Jupiter has not been in this part of your chart in over a decade. But before you dive into new adventures, slow down and consider your options. Mercury goes retrograde today in the same sector. Spend some time thinking about what you’d really like to manifest in the year ahead.

"
17 november 2018,leo,"Your ability to get your point across skyrockets now that Venus is direct in your house of communication. You won’t have to beat anybody over the head either! Just put it out there. Your personal magnetism is also increasing, something that people will notice.

"
18 november 2018,leo,"You know what has to be done. So what are you waiting for? The perfect conditions to come along? Let’s face it, situations will never be absolutely perfect. The most important thing is that you get started.

"
19 november 2018,leo,"Not everyone shares your sunny attitude towards life! So if you happen to be in the presence of someone who wants to burst your bubble, pull away. You don’t need their negative mojo bringing you down.

"
21 november 2018,leo,"You’ve never given a rat’s ass if people like you, or if you fit in. That’s what makes you so fierce… and fun! Today is a perfect day to go loud and proud. Who cares if you offend someone; maybe they need to wake up.

"
22 november 2018,leo,"You’ve probably heard this phrase: “You become like the five people you hang around with the most.” A pretty sobering thought, no? Well, tonight’s full moon in your house of friends and networking shines its light on your closest connections. Choose your friends and colleagues wisely.

"
23 november 2018,leo,"You may be feeling like a steam pipe that is about to burst. Emotions and ideas are building up inside you….but whom should you discuss them with? Pick your confidantes wisely, Leo.

"
24 november 2018,leo,"If your love life or financial situation has been on hold, you can blame it on Neptune being retrograde. It was spinning backward in your house of net worth and intimacy, but fortunately that ends today. Get ready for forward monement, at least on your part. Others may not be as quick to get going!

"
27 november 2018,leo,"The energy from yesterday’s magnificent Jupiter-Sun aspect is still in play. Actually, it intensifies because magnetic Mercury joins them. This is an incredible time to speak your mind and demonstrate your creativity. It’s also perfect for flirting or telling someone how much you love them. The next twelve months are some of the best ever for experiencing joy and savoring life.

"
28 november 2018,leo,"There has been an awful lot of planetary activity over the last few days encouraging you to have fun. Which is fine…but you still have to get the grunt work accomplished! Today is a powerful time to develop some good habits and routines. These are the kind that can put money in your pocket, by the way.

"
29 november 2018,leo,"Taking a calculated risk could actually pay off thanks to a Moon-Uranus aspect. Therefore, don’t dismiss what seem to be crazy ideas, or listen to people who tell you that “it can’t be done.” Spend the month of December thinking about grand plans, because once Mars enters this part of your chart on December 31st, it’s all systems go.

"
30 november 2018,leo,"A powerful voice inside your head it telling you to go for it. Then a little wimpy one is shrieking, “I’m afraid!” I’ve got news for you, Leo. The stronger voice is going to win this battle. So stop waffling and take that leap. Besides, since when does the word “wimp” ever apply to a Leo?

"
1 december 2018,leo,"Feeling good in your own skin is important to you, any anything or anyone who messes should be under scrutiny. Mercury retrogrades today in your house of emotional stability. This is a short retro period–it’s over by the 6th–but you should use it to figure out just what you need to feel more chill. Even a languid lion can get stressed, after all.

"
2 december 2018,leo,"If you want something badly enough in your life, you will make it happen. The Sun is in your house of creativity and talent. Brilliant Uranus is active in your house of big picture thinking. Just don’t expect overnight success.

"
3 december 2018,leo,"A laid-back approach will get you much further than coming on strong, Leo. Yes, we know. You love to growl and roar. But today is not the time for displays of power or emotion. Play it cool.

"
4 december 2018,leo,"The cosmos wants you to develop more inner peace, lion. Today you might be quite introspective, reflecting about the issues and emotions that may be troubling you. The good news is that you have the mental tools for working on yourself. What are you waiting for?

"
5 december 2018,leo,"Your sign is famous for drama. Heck, many singers and actors are Leos. But today’s not the time for outward displays of emotion. Hissy fits, angry eruptions, poor little me routines—shelve ‘em. And if other people are acting this way, let them know that you don’t want to partake.

"
6 december 2018,leo,"Matters at home should quiet down now that Mercury is direct in your domestic sector. It’s smart to put these things behind you, because tomorrow’s new Moon occurs in your house of romance. You’re going to have far sweeter things to think about!

"
7 december 2018,leo,"A brand-new chapter in life can open up, if  you are willing to let go of some less-than-helpful emotions. The problem is that Mars and Neptune both square the new moon from the most sensitive part of your chart. You need to let go of jealousy, old dramas and resentment if you desire progress.

"
8 december 2018,leo,"Are you ready to let your talents really shine? A new moon yesterday occurred in your house of creativity. The power of a new moon is the most potent in the two weeks that follow it. You can focus on the skills you bring to the workplace or the fun you can have just puttering around with oil paints, for example, as a hobby. Mercury enters this house on Wednesday, so now’s the time to dive in.

"
9 december 2018,leo,"Your personal happiness is becoming a bigger priority to you. And so it should be. It’s one thing to worry and care about other people, and another to lose yourself in the process. Take care of yourself, Leo.

"
10 december 2018,leo,"If you want to be successful at something, it may be wise to model somebody else whom you admire. Why reinvent the wheel? This way you can make progress without doing anything too risky.

"
11 december 2018,leo,"People could be tossing around their attitudes and opinions, but you don’t have to pay attention to them! You know where you’re coming from and are content with your own ideas. Let others go loud and proud. You don’t need to join them.

"
12 december 2018,leo,"It’s no secret—your sign is the most creative of the zodiac! And the planets are lining up in an amazing way to help you tap into your talents. There was a new moon in this sector a few days ago and today Mercury enters it. The next twelve months can be game changers; are you ready?

"
13 december 2018,leo,"You may be tempted to cut corners today, but it wouldn’t be wise. Yes, you’re a creative genius–all Leos are! And yes, you have some super ideas. But don’t let emotions run this show. Logic is needed instead.

"
14 december 2018,leo,"Yikes. From your chart it looks like you could  be an emotional mess today. But you don’t have to be. Channel your energy into healing instead. With motivated Mars in one of the most psychological parts of your chart, it’s possible to get rid of some of the mental junk.

"
15 december 2018,leo,"Aahhhh. A lovely lunar aspect soothes your tired mind and soul. Your sign has been going through a lot emotionally as of late, and chances are you’re weary. But naturally, you’re too proud to show it. Go off to your lair, lick your wounds and re-emerge as your usual fierce self.

"
16 december 2018,leo,"Today is a good time to beautify your home. If you’re tripping over piles of unwashed clothes, toys or unread newspapers, it’s time to get organized. Likewise, your place should be gorgeous, not so-so. Start planning new purchases now and then wait for everything to go on sale after Christmas.  You need a lush lair, baby.

"
17 december 2018,leo,"You will be coming to some fast decisions over the next week, and the good thing is that you’re in a terrific spot to do so. The two most assertive planets in the solar system, Mars and Pluto, are teaming up in your houses of logic and emotion. Both your head and your heart will be working together, rather than against each other!

"
18 december 2018,leo,"You have some mixed vibes going on. On the one hand, you may feel like pulling away from the madding crowd, nursing your wounds and dealing with your emotions. On the other hand, planets are pushing you to be bold and break the rules. Can you do both? Of course you can. You’re a Leo.

"
19 december 2018,leo,"Your creativity is soaring and even you could be surprised by it. Sure, the planets are lining up to help you express yourself to the fullest. But the planets can’t do everything! Take credit for the hard work you’ve put in.

"
20 december 2018,leo,"You’re famous for being the most creative sign of the zodiac, but even you can benefit from some inspiration. There will be plenty of that today, my friend! A terrific Sun-Uranus aspect will allow inspiration to hit you like a 10-ton truck. Have your sketchbook ready, or whatever you use to record your ideas. This Saturday’s full moon is the perfect time for working on them.

"
21 december 2018,leo,"The cosmos is getting ready to give you a swift kick in the ass! No, this isn’t a takedown where you end up eating humble pie. This is more about a wakeup call, telling you to pull your act together and get moving. The Sun is now in Capricorn, your sixth house of productivity. You’re going to turn into a cyclone of efficient activity.

"
22 december 2018,leo,"Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey hey, goodbye! Yeah, that’s your theme song these days thanks to tonight’s full moon in Cancer. It’s time to close out the past and move on, as Cancer is your twelfth house of closure and transition. No need to wait until New Year’s Day. Do it now.

"
23 december 2018,leo,"You can try to forget things, or you can deal with them instead. This doesn’t mean that you have to spend weeks or months ruminating over old issues. Process them and let them go.

"
24 december 2018,leo,"Don’t be so emo! A Mercury-Neptune square could bring out tension that has been building up inside of you. Fortunately this passes very quickly, by tomorrow in fact. Avoid people who are known button pushers and whiners and you’ll be OK.

"
25 december 2018,leo,"Woo-hoo! It’s Christmas and the moon is in Leo. Neptune is a good angle from your house of intimacy, making for a romantic day. But it also could be cathartic, as you realize that negative emotions don’t have to plague you. Over the next five days you will be doing a lot of deep thinking about releasing old baggage.

"
26 december 2018,leo,"Oh, the places you’ll go! Of course, this is the title of a book written by Dr. Seuss. But it’s also the cosmos’ message for you today. Sparkling Uranus is firing you up to live bigger and bolder than ever. And we all know that a lion never backs away from a challenge.

"
27 december 2018,leo,"You’re not afraid of hard work, which is a good thing. You’re getting ready to dive into a project that has fabulous long-term consequences. It could cost time, money and effort right now, but in the long run you’ll be happy that you did it.

"
28 december 2018,leo,"Today’s aspects are perfect for beautifying your home environment. Pluto, planet of transformation, is active, telling you to clean out closets and junk drawers. At the same time glamorous Venus is stirring things up in your domestic sector. Hit the sales and buy some things to make your place more posh.

"
29 december 2018,leo,"You’ve been getting riled up about a lot of things lately. It doesn’t seem as though you’re overreacting; you truly do have things to be annoyed about. But is it worth it? A lunar aspect makes you question the cost of entertaining negative thoughts. It simply may not be worth it.

"
30 december 2018,leo,"If you’ve been playing it too safe lately, the cosmos is going to give you a wake-up call. Our self image can be one of the most limiting factors that we deal with. Many people assume that it’s our circumstances that hold us back. But in actuality, it could be the limits within our minds.

"
31 december 2018,leo,"Out with the old, in with the new… and ultra exciting! If 2018 wasn’t exactly the most scintillating year for you, put on your seatbelt. Things are about to get a heck of a lot more interesting. That’s because red hot Mars enters your house of adventure today, a place it hasn’t been for some time. 2019 will be all about taking risks, the smart kind.

"
22 january 2018,virgo,"
If your home isn’t your castle, it should be. A dreamy Venus-Jupiter aspect today suggests that you turn your place into a perfect haven. Naturally, this involves some decorating, but it also includes settling dramas that may be going on with other people.

"
8 march 2018,virgo,"Is it time to go back to school or get more job training? Jupiter is moving retrograde in your house of thinking, writing and self-expression. Those Virgos who are already attending school may switch majors or decide to take a different approach. Also consider how you speak to others—and how you talk to yourself! Be kinder and treat yourself well.

"
9 march 2018,virgo,"Issues at home or within your family may need to be addressed, and today is a smart time to do so. Energetic Mars is in your domestic sector for the first time in two years and will be leaving on the 17th. Take care of things now, anything from home repairs to relationships.

"
10 march 2018,virgo,"Arguments about intimacy, commitment and money could arise between now and Wednesday, Virgo, so take a deep breath and count to ten. Someone may try to push you into overspending or investing in something that’s questionable. Or, you may be on an emotional spending spree. Don’t go there!

"
11 march 2018,virgo,"Your head and your heart could be at odds today, so (a) don’t get frustrated and (b) avoid making big decisions! The good news is that the planetary energy shifts for the better tomorrow. Wait until then.

"
12 march 2018,virgo,"There may be times this week when you’ll have to read carefully between the lines to figure out what people are really thinking. Your intuition is stronger than you may suspect, so use it to your advantage.

"
13 march 2018,virgo,"Over the next few days you’ll need to read between the lines in order to figure out what people are saying and thinking. It’s not that they’re trying to deceive you. But your emotions may be getting in the way, overriding logical thought. All the more reason to probe before you mouth off.

"
14 march 2018,virgo,"Keep your opinions to yourself today, especially around the office. You may have the best intentions and your ideas could be right on track, but others may oppose where you’re coming from. The aggravation isn’t worth it!

"
15 march 2018,virgo,"Saturday’s upcoming new moon occurs in your house of serious love, and it’s a honey. You might start feeling the energy today. It’s a good time to think about what it is that you truly want from a love relationship. Create that short list!

"
16 march 2018,virgo,"Got the urge to merge? A Moon-Neptune meet-up in your house of bonding could lead to an interesting romantic or business partnership. Tomorrow’s new moon will be in this part of the sky, and it’s a honey for romance as well as creative business alliances.

"
17 march 2018,virgo,"Yeah, baby! Your sign is the recipient of one heck of a gift from the cosmos: two planetary aspects in both of the houses that govern love. Lusty and energetic Mars enters your fifth house of romance, the place where we find new love or have more fun in an existing relationship. And a new moon occurs in your commitment sector, the place where we deepen our love and promises to each other. Yum.

"
18 march 2018,virgo,"Preparing for your financial future is the order of the day. Maybe you view the future as some kind of far off time that is light years away. It’s actually closer than you might think, so start making preparations now.

"
19 march 2018,virgo,"They say that talk is cheap, but that’s not the case with you today, Virgo. Your words carry weight so use them wisely. Fortunately gentle Venus is in a good angle, helping you soften your message.

"
20 march 2018,virgo,"The Sun is in the sexiest, most sultry part of your chart, so I hope you’re well rested! The next four weeks could be quite passionate, but you’ll have to watch the tendency for becoming jealous or dramatic.

"
21 march 2018,virgo,"Mind your money over the next few weeks, Virgo. Be ultra careful if purchasing items online, check your credit card statements and don’t go overboard with spending. It’s also a smart idea to review your financial statements, such as IRAs or mutual fund accounts. Mercury goes retro tomorrow in this area!

"
22 march 2018,virgo,"Your sign is famous for being attentive to details, and that’s a quality you’re going to need over the next three weeks. Mercury begins to backstroke in your house of financial dealings. It’s imperative to know where your money is, how it’s being spent and how well your investments are doing. Protect your identity. Hold off on entering into contracts or joint ventures (if you can) through April 15th.

"
23 march 2018,virgo,"A battle of wills could erupt, especially with a lover or a child over the next few days. Get ready for some Oscar-worthy dramatic performances! But all you need to do is to stay calm, cool and collected. Getting pulled in to a debate or hissy fit is not in your best interests right now.

"
24 march 2018,virgo,"Staying calm and balanced within is a state that many people aspire to. The Sun is trying to shine its beneficial light on the dark recesses of your mind, but your ego wants to keep the drama going. Which celestial orb will win this battle? It depends on you. What is more important–serenity or chaos?

"
25 march 2018,virgo,"You should be in quite a social mood due to a happy Moon-Jupiter aspect. The planets are telling you to get out there and have some fun with the tribe. If you can, plan a quick trip out of town in the near future too.

"
26 march 2018,virgo,"Your ideas are changing, Virgo. And these changes will have a ripple effect which will transform your emotions (for the better, I might add). But right now the ride may be a bumpy one as you process things and do the inner work. Patience, my friend.

"
27 march 2018,virgo,"It’s time to tap into your subconscious mind and rely on its wisdom more often. While you’re at it, you may want to start some good habits, like meditating, journaling and mindfulness. This week’s full moon is all about creating more stability in your life. Why not start with your mind and emotions?

"
28 march 2018,virgo,"Who says that Virgos are as pure as the driven snow? Today’s a good time to get down and maybe a little, uh, dirty. A saucy meet-up between spontaneous Uranus and romantic Venus is perfect for flirting and canoodling! Enjoy.

"
29 march 2018,virgo,"Personal relationships could have a back-and-forth feel as the Sun squares Saturn. Do you dive in or pull away? Push for an answer or wait awhile? Compromise or hold your ground? Reflect, but don’t make any key decisions now.

"
30 march 2018,virgo,"Holding on to the past could prevent you from moving forward, Virgo, especially when it comes to close relationships. The new moon back on the 17th opened up doors. There are fresh opportunities for you to enjoy the company of other people. But nothing will happen if you remain stuck in the past.

"
31 march 2018,virgo,"Some kind of a financial deal could come to a happy conclusion over the next two weeks, thanks to the full moon in your income sector. This could mean a raise, new job, landing a big client or starting a side business. There is a strong creative vibe at play, telling you to dazzle others with your talent, and to do whatever it takes to develop your skill set.

"
1 april 2018,virgo,"Having clarity is a beautiful thing, especially when it comes to your emotions. A brilliant Sun-Mercury meeting helps you to get to the bottom of personal issues that may have been troubling you. The smartest thing you can do is to identify the people or situations that set you off–then avoid them.

"
2 april 2018,virgo,"You could be feeling mighty impatient about love, demanding to know what’s going to happen next. But the harder you push the more frustrated you’ll become. Slow down before you alienate others too.

"
3 april 2018,virgo,"It’s time to make a big change–you know it deep inside your heart and in your head. There’s nothing holding you back, other than a voice that questions whether or not you have the talent or skills. The answer is “yes”, so stop stalling and get to work!

"
4 april 2018,virgo,"Virgos have the stereotype of being oh so practical, but you love swag just as much as the rest of us. Maybe a little too much these days, thanks to Mars blazing a path through your house of luxury and entertainment. Start being selective about how much you spend and where you spend it.

"
5 april 2018,virgo,"Pushing people for answers may sound like a good idea initially but will probably backfire instead. Yes, your emotions may be going all over the place, but trying to pin people down will only create more agita.

"
6 april 2018,virgo,"You may have been feeling apprehensive about what’s going on in your life, but it’s all a part of growth and change. A sparkling Uranus aspect today enables you to break out of your comfort zone…even if that’s just a tiny bit!

"
7 april 2018,virgo,"You’re in no mood these days for trying to figure out what’s going on in someone else’s mind, that’s for sure. Let others know that you need to understand what they’re all about if your relationship is going to work.

"
8 april 2018,virgo,"You may need to come on a bit strong today in order to get your point across. But that’s OK. You don’t have to yell or create a lot of drama; just say what needs to be said. You’ll be glad later this week that you got it all out there.

"
9 april 2018,virgo,"You may think that all of your ideas are right on point, but from your chart it appears that some of them are out of date. Accept that personal growth requires facing certain truths. Besides, changing your mindset will be more liberating than you might imagine.

"
10 april 2018,virgo,"Behind that self-confident exterior is a person who might be feeling a bit insecure these days. Don’t worry, this is a temporary blip on the cosmic radar. You’ll be feeling feisty again by Thursday.

"
11 april 2018,virgo,"Yes! Mars and Venus, those lusty cosmic lovers, form a terrific aspect. Venus is in your house of optimism and adventure, while the red planet is stationed in your house of frisky romance. Gotta love this energy. This is no time to settle for a boring love life!

"
12 april 2018,virgo,"You’re not a showy person by nature but sometimes you need to be recognized for everything that you do. So stop hiding your light under a bushel and step out into the sunshine, my friend. Work what you’ve got and don’t hold back.

"
13 april 2018,virgo,"Lucky Jupiter will spend most of 2018 in your house of socializing. It’s a tough job, Virgo, but someone has to do it and it might as well be you. Over the next few days you should put your chores and worries aside and enjoy life, as Jupiter is in a playful mood. Attention single people: be on the lookout for a new flame.

"
14 april 2018,virgo,"Red hot Mars is pushing hard for changes on the home front, whatever that means to you: moving in with a lover, relocating to a different state, redecorating, settling family battles or dealing with an ex. Fortunately inspirational Neptune is on the case too, making things flow more easily than usual.

"
15 april 2018,virgo,"Mercury has been retrograde in one emotional place, your eighth house. This sector governs love, sex and money, so if the last few weeks have been difficult in these areas, now you know why. The little bugger goes direct today, so take a deep breath and exhale. A more prosperous and fulfilling six month period lies ahead, FYI.

"
16 april 2018,virgo,"Love and money are the topics that capture our attention, and today’s new moon in Aries focuses on both for Virgos. It’s time to develop a more mature, long-term view of the future when it comes to your net worth and your relationships. There’s no more room for drama or uncertainty.

"
17 april 2018,virgo,"Love and lust are not always the same thing. If you’re lucky they’ll coexist within a relationship. If not, you may need to fix things. The recent new moon occurred in your sexuality sector, opening up an exciting new phase in intimacy. But today stern Saturn begins to retrograde in your romance house, asking you if balance exists.

"
18 april 2018,virgo,"Mind your money today, Virgo. A sizzling Sun-Uranus aspect is smokin’ hot when it comes to locating a fabulous investment opportunity or entering into some kind of business venture. But you might be tempted to spend or invest more than you should. Keep things real.

"
19 april 2018,virgo,"Confidence is sexy and it’s time for you to become more confident! Fortunately a lively lunar aspect puts you in the driver’s seat—and it’s a Lamborghini. Go out there and strut your stuff.

"
20 april 2018,virgo,"Your ideas about love, risk and living a bolder life are about to change, Virgo. Planetary activity in the two houses that deal with creativity and putting yourself out there are putting you in a reflective place. If a complete life overhaul seems intimidating, why not start with some baby steps? Little changes add up, dontcha know.

"
21 april 2018,virgo,"Sharing the same values as the other people in your world is important, Virgo. You don’t have to be a clone of your friends or lover, but it certainly helps to share some of the same ideals and dreams. Do an assessment and see who fits. Are you giving away who you truly are in order to fit in with the crowd?

"
22 april 2018,virgo,"If you want to “rewrite” your love life, now’s the time to do so! Powerful Pluto goes retrograde in your house of romance, asking what you  need and desire. From your chart it appears that you won’t be settling for table scraps, so start writing that list of demands right now!

"
23 april 2018,virgo,"Sharing is caring? Maybe not! With the Moon in your hush-hush zone, you should be careful about what you reveal today. This is more of an issue in your personal life than your professional one. Steer clear of blabbing about your life on social media: this is not the best moment for TMI.

"
24 april 2018,virgo,"Getting things done your way becomes a lot easier now that gentle Venus is in Gemini. Beating people over the head won’t be necessary; a quiet sense of authority will work far better. You’re currently in a place where creativity counts for a lot, so think about fresh ways of handling old problems.

"
25 april 2018,virgo,"“That’s not logical, Captain!”  Go into Vulcan mode today and do your best Spock imitation. Operate purely on rational thought and avoid allowing emotions to color your thinking. A Mercury-Saturn square demands using the left side of your brain.

"
27 april 2018,virgo,"You may be dying to treat yourself with some swag or an expensive vacation. Maybe you’re lusting after a Maseratti or some designer clothes. Yup, golden girl Venus is in full glam mode and she wants to spend, spend, spend. But don’t go there, at least not today.

"
28 april 2018,virgo,"A battle between your heart and your head may be raging as you try to decide which direction to head in. Don’t make any major decisions today. Instead, wait for Monday’s full moon, a much better time. This lunation occurs in your house of thinking and strategizing, making it the perfect moment for closure.

"
29 april 2018,virgo,"Persistence pays off, Virgo! Your sign is already famous for its discipline but now’s the time to buckle down and put in some more hard work. The rewards will be worth it, though. A little tip from the cosmos: your workload will lighten and flow more easily if you take a more creative approach to getting things done.

"
30 april 2018,virgo,"An idea or project that you’ve been working on may finally start to fall into place, Virgo! The full moon in your house of thinking and expression could also bring in people who see the genius of your ideas….and they want to partner with you. Your creativity is exceptionally high right now, so make the most of it.

"
1 may 2018,virgo,"A battle between your logical mind and your emotions could arise as Uranus opposes the Moon. La Luna is in a quite practical place, pointing out strategies and smart ways of thinking and expressing yourself. But erratic Uranus is pitching a hissy pit from your way-too-emo eighth house, demanding to be heard. A piece of advice: let logic win this one!

"
2 may 2018,virgo,"Who’s the boss in your closest relationships, Virgo? No matter how gentle or accommodating you might be these days, others may be downright confrontational. Remember that this is their sh**, not yours. Let them stew and move on with your daily activities.

"
3 may 2018,virgo,"With Jupiter retrograde in your house of self-expression, you may be feeling tongue tied or lacking in confidence. This little storm passes quickly and by tomorrow your energy will be on the upswing. So will flirting, chatting and planning some fun escapades with the people you love.

"
4 may 2018,virgo,"Playing for keeps? You have a lot of planets in your flirty, frisky fifth house, but it looks like you want some seriousness mixed in with the fun and games. If you’re single or with someone who doesn’t float your boat, the next few weeks could bring in an enticing person who’s a break from the same old, same old.

"
5 may 2018,virgo,"The cosmos is telling you that if you want to get ahead in this world, you need to know what your strengths and weaknesses are. Sometimes this is a difficult task, being that honest about yourself. But a helpful Moon-Pluto aspect will enable you to get to the bottom of your psyche with ease.

"
6 may 2018,virgo,"The following week will be a wonky one in which your ability to get along with others will be fine one day, then tested the next. Today is a good day, especially when it comes to having fun with a lover or pals who really know how to live la vida loca. Find people who are interested in having an escapade!

"
7 may 2018,virgo,"Avoid “group think” like the plague today, Virgo. People around you may be trying to get you to think their way or follow their agenda, and they could resort to underhanded means in the process. Don’t fall for it.

"
8 may 2018,virgo,"This is not a good time to over promise and under deliver. Nor is it a smart moment to fudge something on a term paper or blab too much on social media. Hold off on product launches too, if you can. A stern Sun-Jupiter opposition will put your words and deeds under a microscope. This doesn’t last long though: by Friday the coast is clear.

"
9 may 2018,virgo,"Consistency counts, and the people in your world need to know that you are reliable. This is true of your behavior, moods and work ethic. This doesn’t mean that you can’t be fun, though, or have fun!

"
10 may 2018,virgo,"Your ability to cooperate with others grows thanks to a happy Neptunian aspect. But after this week you may go the Lone Ranger route, surging forward with your own agenda. Just remember that you’ll need some help along the way.

"
11 may 2018,virgo,"An amazing Sun-Pluto trine blows the doors off preconceived notions you’ve had about yourself, Virgo. Your courage and creativity are soaring, so don’t even think about trying to fight this feeling! Besides, once Uranus enters Taurus next Tuesday, you’ll be experiencing this vibe for the next eight years.

"
12 may 2018,virgo,"Hold your horses there, pardner! This is not a good day to try to lasso someone into an agreement. The harder you push the more they’ll resist. Give things more time. Either that, or move on.

"
13 may 2018,virgo,"Got a message you want to get out there? Thinking about expanding your mind (and your options) by signing up for a course of study? Thinking about writing a book or starting a blog? Then hop to it! Quick thinking Mercury is now in your ninth house, the place where we take risks and absorb new information.

"
14 may 2018,virgo,"Spunky Uranus tells you to take a risk and put your emotions out there! Vulnerability is not always a bad thing, and holding things in can cause so much unhappiness. You’ve grown a lot as a person over the past eight years. Why not let the world see whom you have become?

"
15 may 2018,virgo,"Who wants to play by the rules? Not you anymore! Rebellious Uranus is now in your free thinking, adventurous ninth house. The next eight years are super for getting involved in activities that push you past your comfort level. This includes romance, by the way, so don’t be afraid to take a chance on a different type.

"
16 may 2018,virgo,"Distant lands are calling your name, Virgo! So are universities and new friends and sexy lovers. So are beaches and restaurants and terrific books. The new moon falls in your house of travel, education and taking some calculated risks. Between now and November your mind will expand exponentially!

"
17 may 2018,virgo,"With Mars is in your efficiency sector, you are hell bent on getting things done. So much so that if the slightest delay crops up, you could lose your cool. The same goes for slackers in your midst. Remember that things need time to manifest, and that they’re not conveniently going to happen on your schedule.

"
18 may 2018,virgo,"Creativity soars with a winning Mercury-Saturn trine! No matter what you do for a living, or if you’re a stay-at-home parent, you need to develop your talent. Now is the perfect time to sign up for a class or block time for working on things that will help you shine.

"
19 may 2018,virgo,"The company you keep becomes more important than usual now that Venus is in your house of networking. Your social calendar could fill up over the next three weeks as you book dinners, cocktails and movie dates with your friends. Industry events could bear fruit too, so don’t leave them out.

"
20 may 2018,virgo,"Got goals? I sure hope so because now is the best time in 2018 to go after them! The Sun is now in your house of ambition and success, a place it will remain for four weeks. Considering that Venus entered your house of mentors and networking yesterday, one of the smartest things that you could do is to align yourself with movers and shakers.

"
21 may 2018,virgo,"Your subconscious mind could be in full blown fantasy mode, but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing! You could get more in touch with your creative side. Or your lusty, adventurous one. Don’t worry, you won’t go overboard with this! Logical Saturn is balancing out this energy.

"
22 may 2018,virgo,"Anyone who thinks that you do everything by the book is way off, Virgo. A series of stellar aspects over the next week will heighten your ability to come up with cutting edge, new ideas. These people may end up being shocked, but so be it. Sometimes it’s kind of fun being underestimated!

"
23 may 2018,virgo,"If in doubt, don’t say it….or do it! A tense Mercury-Jupiter opposition warns against making promises you can’t deliver on. Likewise, make sure that you’re not indulging in wishful thinking when it comes to any big plans. The approaching full moon on the 29th will help you make practical decisions, so wait until then if you can.

"
24 may 2018,virgo,"By the inch it’s a cinch, by the yard it’s hard. That old saying applies to you today as the planets line up in your houses of organization and making progress. Motivational Mars is in a good spot to get you off and running as you dig into projects that may have seemed overwhelming in the past.

"
25 may 2018,virgo,"New age gurus like to preach about how “abundance is everywhere” and that we’re all entitled to a life full of goodies. This can sound trite and unrealistic, but today you may actually have a sense that this is possible. A wonderful Jupiter-Neptune trine could open your mind to the idea that yes, you can  live a wonderful life and that it’s your turn to grab that brass ring.

"
26 may 2018,virgo,"Expressing what’s going on inside of you is what it’s all about today, Virgo! This includes expressing your love and affection for someone. Talking about your latest cool plan or idea. Creating vacation plans with your family, lover or tribe. Let it out!

"
27 may 2018,virgo,"Do the people around you share the same values as you, Virgo? Naturally everyone has different ideas about how to run their lives, and you don’t want to associate with people who are clones of you. But if other people in your world are starting to head in a direction that you don’t care for, then pull away.

"
28 may 2018,virgo,"Your mind is full of logical thoughts, so why are you so unsure of yourself? Could be the Moon in Scorpio, which is making you bit fearful that things aren’t going to work out the way you’d like. If in doubt, don’t voice your worries. Tomorrow’s full moon will bring some much needed clarity.

"
29 may 2018,virgo,"If family members or a lover have been taking you for granted, tonight’s full moon is a great time to take back some control. It occurs in your domestic sector, shedding light on issues that may have been troubling you. Shrewd Mercury glides into the most authoritative part of your chart too, telling you to quietly and calmly step into a place of greater personal power.

"
30 may 2018,virgo,"How happy we are in life often has to do with how we’re being treated by other people. A tense Moon-Neptune aspect could create static in a close relationship, and you might react quite emotionally. But remember that in the end, you have control over your own thoughts—which in turn creates your emotions.

"
31 may 2018,virgo,"The things you want in life may be closer at hand than you may think, Virgo. It’s time to think more creatively. Stop waiting for your ship to come in. Instead, swim out to meet it.

"
1 june 2018,virgo,"It’s time to walk the walk if you’re going to talk the talk, Virgo. A promising Mercury-Mars aspect tells you to take your grand ideas and start breaking them down into bite-sized, workable chunks. This could be anything from a fitness plan to finding new love to launching a start-up. Stop dreaming and start doing.

"
2 june 2018,virgo,"No man or woman can get through life without the help of others, something that you may need to be reminded about. Fortunately, finding people who are willing to lend a helping hand gets easier with a Venus-Neptune trine. Be prepared to pitch in and help them in return.

"
3 june 2018,virgo,"With Mars touring your house of habits and routines, you’re probably aware that changes need to be made. This includes your health as well as the way you get things done at home and at the office. But acting hastily will backfire. Think things through before you commit to a new plan or system.

"
4 june 2018,virgo,"There is so much that you can go after and accomplish these days. The two most logical and strategic orbs, the Sun and Mercury, meet up in your house of ambition, stirring up fresh ideas. But you’re better off relying on your own inner wisdom than the advice of other people, as deceptive Neptune is swirling its mist.

"
5 june 2018,virgo,"Someone in a pissy mood may be out there with a sharp pin in their hand, just looking for someone’s bubble to burst. Avoid known malcontents if you can, Virgo. But if you can’t, let this slide. An air of teamwork arrives next week when Mercury enters Cancer.

"
6 june 2018,virgo,"You know where you’re  going….why is everyone else so confused? Don’t let the indecisiveness of others affect you over the next 48 hours, Virgo. Let them figure out their own issues or path through life. We all have lessons to learn and it’s time for them to figure this out.

"
7 june 2018,virgo,"With the Sun in your house of ambition, you’re right on point when it comes to your future path. From your chart it appears that you’re better off flying solo these days rather than taking on partners. They may actually hold you back, despite their promises to the contrary. If a lover is trying to slow you down, they need to be set straight!

"
8 june 2018,virgo,"In astrology, the eighth house governs sex, intimacy and your emotions. The Moon glides into this sector today, possibly making this a steamy weekend! But you have to watch out for emotions raging out of control as obsessive Pluto is in a difficult spot.

"
9 june 2018,virgo,"Passion! We all want it. It’s the stuff that books and movies are made of. What really floats your boat, Virgo? That’s the question the cosmos asks of you today. If you’ve been hiding in the shadows, afraid to live la vida loca, then it’s time to take a few chances.

"
10 june 2018,virgo,"With the Moon entering the most optimistic part of your chart, your spirits should start to rise. You’re about to enter a social phase in which working closely with others is important. This just doesn’t mean at the office; charitable work, joining a sports team or pooling your skills with fellow hobbyists could reap fun rewards.

"
11 june 2018,virgo,"With optimistic Jupiter in your house of self-expression, you should feel free to say what’s on your mind! Who cares if others don’t like it? They’re probably more annoyed with how confident you are rather than the content of your message.

"
12 june 2018,virgo,"If you’re smart you’ll work on developing a bigger contact list, Virgo. Convivial Mercury is now in your house of networking, and some of the people you’ll meet could play a big part in the months and years to come. This is true in love and business, not to mention just making some fabulous new friends.

"
13 june 2018,virgo,"Every year you get a gift from the cosmos: a new moon in the house of ambition and success. Today is the day, so over the next six months you can pursue just about any dream your brain can come up with. But with Venus entering the hush-hush zone, you’d be wise to keep some of these plans under wraps for the time being.

"
14 june 2018,virgo,"Uneasiness about the direction that a plan is heading may arise today, Virgo. Either that or someone pulls a switcheroo that puts everything in question. Your best bet is to observe quietly and say little. Your intuition is sharp, so rely on it for hidden intel.

"
15 june 2018,virgo,"You don’t owe anything to anybody—so why are they acting that way? It’s due to the Mercury-Saturn opposition in your house of  friends and close contacts. Even a lover could cop an attitude. Things improve on Tuesday, so walk away from their nonsense for now.

"
16 june 2018,virgo,"Creating deeper connections with people is in the stars over the next week, and you could also meet some interesting new people. This is your best time in 2018 to lend a hand to a charity or get involved in volunteer work. It’s also a great time to join meet-ups in your area to connect with people who have interests similar to yours.

"
17 june 2018,virgo,"You may have more support than you realize from others, Virgo. It may not be readily apparent but there are those who believe in you.  But first you need to start believing in yourself.

"
18 june 2018,virgo,"Yikes! Which way is a romantic relationship heading in? Both Saturn and Pluto have been retrograde in your house of love. And today amorous Neptune starts to swim backward in your house of commitment. If you’re attached, it’s time to review your union; if you’re single, it may be time to consider your values and what you’re looking for in a mate.

"
19 june 2018,virgo,"Working well with others is going to be a lot more important over the next month, and today a super aspect helps you pull the team together. It’s also a good time for running ideas past a trusted friend or mentor, so don’t be afraid to ask for advice. Seminars and podcasts could also be a great source of inspiration.

"
20 june 2018,virgo,"One of the smartest things we can do in life is to align ourselves with others who share our dreams and values. Today is a good time to meet new people who fit this bill. It’s also an auspicious moment to hash things out (pleasantly) with friends and loved ones.

"
21 june 2018,virgo,"There’s an old saying: keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer! The Sun enters your house of friends and contacts today, but there’s a warning attached—make sure you’ve vetted everyone. Sometimes you can’t disassociate from trouble makers easily, like at the office for instance. But you can limit what you say to them, so start being selective.

"
22 june 2018,virgo,"If you’re interested in aligning yourself with a group of people (friends, neighbors) who know how to live the good life, this weekend is a good time to meet them. The same goes for hooking up with cutting edge thinkers and mentors in your profession. You ever know where these connections may lead!

"
23 june 2018,virgo,"Trying to figure out what’s going on in someone’s mind is useless, Virgo. People around you may be acting out, dramatic, difficult to read. Let them have the stage. Their antics may continue into next week, and by Friday the 29th you may decide to pull away a bit.

"
24 june 2018,virgo,"With so much planetary activity in one of the most joyful parts of your chart, it would be a shame to be focused on the nyah-nyah stuff. So kick crummy thoughts to the curb and get about the business of having fun. The cosmos demands it.

"
25 june 2018,virgo,"What you think and what you say (or write) are two different things today, Virgo. A Venus-Jupiter square warns against speaking too freely, even if it’s simply expressing your emotions to a loved one. Once Mercury enters your house of confidentiality on Friday, you’ll understand why.

"
26 june 2018,virgo,"You seem to have your fingers in too many pies, running after one activity, then another. The problem is that you’ll never get all of them done. Now that Mars is retrograde in the efficiency part of your chart you can slow down and choose which projects are worth pursuing.

"
27 june 2018,virgo,"Keeping your emotions in check could be a challenge, thanks to the impending full moon arriving in the most dramatic part of your chart tomorrow. To make matters even more heated, friends and colleagues could be sticking their nose in your business or offering advice that is off base. Avoid thinking with your heart and use your head instead.
 
 

"
28 june 2018,virgo,"Sick and tired of playing by other people’s rules? If that’s the case, tonight’s full moon could bring things to a head. The good news is that it will open up a glorious new chapter in which you can let your freak flag fly. Juicier romance, enjoying hobbies and sports, taking in cultural events, living a more colorful life….all of these are on offer for you.

"
29 june 2018,virgo,"A steamy, sexy time can begin as lively Mercury enters your house of behind-closed-doors activities. Sure, you could use this energy to quietly look for a new job, but isn’t it time for some action in the boudoir? Secret crushes are also a good possibility!

"
30 june 2018,virgo,"Someone may say or do something that will catch you off guard. It could be that they’re overly opinionated or they throw a monkey wrench into your plans. The problem is that your own thinking and intuition will be off, so don’t react right away. Wait a few days for clarity to return.

"
1 july 2018,virgo,"Sometimes you can get more done by being laid back than by being aggressive, and this is one of those times. That doesn’t mean that you should avoid people. By all means speak to them, work with them….but be more relaxed in your approach.

"
2 july 2018,virgo,"Virgos are pragmatic souls, but that doesn’t mean that they aren’t romantic. Au contraire! A wonderful Saturn aspect helps you get in touch with your softer, more sentimental side. That said, you still want guarantees….and no unnecessary drama.

"
3 july 2018,virgo,"It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it that counts! And with lucky Jupiter in fine form from your house of communicating, you’ll have no problem in speaking with confidence. Don’t be surprised if others want to join forces with you, and this includes romance.

"
4 july 2018,virgo,"This can be quite an amorous day thanks to the Moon winking at Neptune across the heavens. You can choose to hole yourself up in ye old boudoir with your lover, but there’s a highly social aspect going on too. So head outside and create your own private fireworks later.

"
5 july 2018,virgo,"They say that people make the world go round and in your case, it’s completely true! A super Sun-Jupiter aspect can put you in touch with the right kind of people–a new lover, friends, mentors or movers and shakers. So don’t sit at home watching TV. The next few weeks are well aspected for broadening your social circle.

"
6 july 2018,virgo,"Slow down! You need to give both your body and mind some time to rebalance after a lot of exertion. Yes, you have a lot on your plate and need to get things done…but if you don’t take better care of yourself you’ll end up burning out. And how will that help?

"
7 july 2018,virgo,"A sudden urge to pack your bags and head to the airport could strike, thanks to wild card Uranus acting up in your house of travel. And if you can’t get out of town, you should at least take the day off and head out for a local adventure.

"
8 july 2018,virgo,"What a fabulous day to get on the same page with someone! A helpful Sun-Neptune trine is just the ticket for sharing your ideas and opinions. It’s also possible that new people are anxious to join you on your journey through life, so be open to making some new connections.

"
9 july 2018,virgo,"It’s your time to shine, Virgo! Glamorous Venus glides into your sign today. Not only is this a good time for pampering yourself, it’s also an auspicious moment for getting your message out there. Jupiter resumes direct motion in your house of communication tomorrow.

"
10 july 2018,virgo,"Now that bountiful Jupiter has gone direct, you can say what is on your mind, Virgo. The next three weeks are highly auspicious for getting your reputation and talents out there too. You may surprise a few people with your opinions, but that’s okay. They need to be shaken up.

"
11 july 2018,virgo,"Anyone who thinks that Virgos are boring, by-the-book kind of people is in for a big surprise today! Spunky Uranus is on fire in your house of adventure, stirring you take bigger chances. And with happy Venus in your sign, you’re not going to be afraid to go for it.

"
13 july 2018,virgo,"Some amazing new people can come into your life over the next few months, Virgo. Today’s solar eclipse takes place in your house of networking and friends. You could also have a heck of a lot of fun with your existing tribe. But will there be time for love? A strong Pluto opposition indicates that you may be more interested in keeping things light and carefree, rather than staying in a couple bubble.

"
14 july 2018,virgo,"It’s time to make some long-lasting changes to your life, Virgo. A stellar Venus-Saturn aspect will give you just the boost you need to make some much-needed changes. The best place to start is with your appearance and your love life.

"
15 july 2018,virgo,"Need a partner in crime? The cosmos is encouraging you to find exciting new people to have fun with. You could also benefit by finding an intelligent mentor, or some business contacts that will help you make headway. A more adventurous new chapter in love could also begin.

"
16 july 2018,virgo,"What floats your boat, Virgo? Today you should be chasing after what pleases you the most! That’s because the Moon and Venus meet up in your sign, a wonderful aspect for getting in touch with your dearest desires. Other people may try to talk you out of things, but don’t pay any attention to them. It’s your life and you have to live it your way.

"
17 july 2018,virgo,"It’s not your karma to be broke and always scraping for money, Virgo. A stinky lunar aspect may make you feel that way today, but it’s not the case. Once the Sun enters Leo next Sunday, you’ll be able to do some deep reflecting about your attitude concerning money and wealth. Better yet? You’ll be able to uncover some savvy ways to earn and save more.

"
18 july 2018,virgo,"Slackers, beware! Virgos have ambitious Mars in their house organization and they are ready to roll…..right over you, if you don’t get your damn job done. There’s nothing wrong today with letting people know that you’re expecting them to pick up the slack. But once the Sun rolls in to Leo on Sunday, keep your opinions to yourself.

"
20 july 2018,virgo,"This could be quite a romantic day with the passionate Moon winking at amorous Neptune. Your charisma is high these days, and you’re in the mood for some secluded action. If you’re single and looking, someone may be around you whom you haven’t noticed yet…but they’ve noticed you!

"
21 july 2018,virgo,"Damn, you look good! Charismatic Venus is making you look like a movie star as it’s sizzling in the sign of Virgo. Then abundant, happy-go-lucky Jupiter is making waves in your house of socializing. This no weekend to stay at home. Get out there and show everyone what you’ve got!

"
22 july 2018,virgo,"The next few weeks are some of the best in 2018 for mental and physical healing. The Sun has just entered Leo, your twelfth house of closure and transition. This is where we take stock of the issues that we’re dealing with and vow to take care of them. Mercury retrograde in this sector on Thursday, which actually is a benefit. This will help you get a handle on the inner workings of your mind.

"
23 july 2018,virgo,"Tired of being the family go-to person? It’s likely with a tense Moon-Neptune square. Don’t let others use guilt or flattery to get their way with you. With so much planetary energy going on right now in your house of efficiency, you’ve got your own long list of things to do.

"
24 july 2018,virgo,"Stick to your guns, Virgo! Gentle Venus in your sign is opposed by Neptune today. Someone may try to take advantage of your good nature. This is no time to be a pushover. You can protect your position without creating a lot of drama.

"
25 july 2018,virgo,"Everyone is entitled to my opinion? Someone around you may be quite bossy today, Virgo. They may be so in love with their own ideas that they can’t see the flaws in them. Don’t bother pointing this out; it will only backfire. Let them figure it out for themselves over time.

"
26 july 2018,virgo,"Heal thyself, Virgo. Mental Mercury has just gone retrograde in one of the most cathartic parts of your chart. The next three weeks are well aspected for dealing with things that have been troubling you. This includes your health, so don’t hesitate to visit doctors or physical therapists.

"
27 july 2018,virgo,"Powerful planetary forces are urging you to get rid of things in your life that are no longer working. This includes people, bad habits, a job that’s gone sour, negative thought patterns or chronic health issues.

It’s also a wonderful time for creative pursuits and hobbies, as your creativity is running high.

"
29 july 2018,virgo,"If your intuition is telling you that something is off, it probably is. But don’t act on things right away.

"
30 july 2018,virgo,"It’s time to partner up with people who know how to have a good time, Virgo. With so much planetary activity in pragmatic parts of your chart, you need to have a fun release. Lucky Jupiter is in a good mood, so get out in your local neighborhood and meet some new friends.

31 july 2018,virgo,"Feeling passionate again is possible, thanks to a delicious Moon-Neptune connection. This is not only holds true for your personal relationships, but it also applies to business. Why not align yourself with a person who understands the way you think and has the same career goals as you?

"
1 august 2018,virgo,"You or other people could get mired in details today, Virgo. The end result will be paralysis by analysis. If you’re up against a deadline, make sure that you don’t end up in this situation. Things could get pretty heated otherwise.

"
2 august 2018,virgo,"Try a different approach with a loved one, Virgo. With the Moon in the most intimate part of your chart, you should be able to make progress. Make sure the words that you say have meaning, and that they come directly from the heart.

"
3 august 2018,virgo,"The cosmos is pushing you to take a few calculated risks… so why are you afraid to do so? A tricky Moon-Sun square is raising concerns in your mind. But that’s okay. Intelligent Mercury is on the case, and by the end of next week you’ll have everything figured out.

"
4 august 2018,virgo,"People who think that you play by the rules are in for a big surprise, Virgo! Eccentric Uranus is active today, encouraging you to do something totally uncharacteristic. This doesn’t mean starting a rebellion or quitting the day job. But you could switch up something about your life to make things more creative and exciting.

"
5 august 2018,virgo,"Your intuition may be giving you guidance about a romantic situation, and if you’re smart you’ll pay attention to it. The same holds true for matters concerning children, if you have them. It seems as though you need to take greater control over a situation, and your inner wisdom is trying to show you how.

"
6 august 2018,virgo,"A posh, sensual time begins now that posh Venus is in Libra. It’s time to start pampering yourself, and your lover as well.

"
7 august 2018,virgo,"Virgos are currently in one of the most mind expanding periods of their entire life. That’s because Uranus, the planet of innovative ideas, is in the most cutting edge, optimistic part of your chart. Anyone who views Virgos as not being creative, or too stuck in details, is in for a big surprise. Uranus goes retrograde today, a benefit as it will help you develop some ground breaking new plans.

"
8 august 2018,virgo,"Relationships take a pragmatic turn today. That’s because Mars and Venus form a helpful aspect in the most practical parts of your chart. Sometimes and love ya just gotta down to brass tacks. That said, Mars is in the most physical part of your chart, so there could be some interesting “sporting activities” in the boudoir.

"
9 august 2018,virgo,"With romantic Venus in your house of security, you need to have a strong foundation when it comes to love. Do you have one? That will be the question today, as Venus squares long-term Saturn. You need to think with your head as much as you do with your heart.

"
10 august 2018,virgo,"You may be more reflective than usual, due to tomorrow’s solar eclipse occurring in the most secluded part of your chart. Ruminating over what needs to stay in your life and what needs to go is a smart move. But others may sense that you’re doing this important inner work, and they can try to throw you off track. If need be, pull away from other people for a few days.

"
12 august 2018,virgo,"Yesterday’s solar eclipse demands that you reflect about the direction your life is heading in. And with Mars retrograding back into your house of romance today, this would be a good place to start. Just be aware that exes can return in this kind of a transit, and so can old dramas and issues. But you’re in a terrific position to take care of things for good.

"
13 august 2018,virgo,"You won’t be in the mood to put up with anybody’s flak today, Virgo. With the Moon in your sign, you are looking out for number one. People may try to win you over to their way of thinking, but it’s not going to work. The recent solar eclipse has made you more interested than usual in getting rid of nonsense from people and situations that don’t serve you.

"
14 august 2018,virgo,"It’s a good day for feeling more comfortable in your own skin, Virgo. A lovely lunar aspect will make you feel more confident and attractive. Naturally, that means that this is a good time to put yourself out there––whether on the job market or the marriage market!

"
15 august 2018,virgo,"Your logical mind maybe saying one thing, while your heart says another. The problem is, you may be hellbent on getting an answer today to something that has been vexing you. With demanding Pluto in a tough spot, you could come on too strong. Chill out and let things take their course.

"
16 august 2018,virgo,"Getting distracted is a real possibility, thanks to erratic Uranus acting out. A new idea or a new direction may pop into your head. Or someone may be anxious to get you to go down their path rather than yours. It’s important to remain focused. Once Mercury goes direct on Sunday, that should be easy.

"
17 august 2018,virgo,"It’s time to open your mind to new things, so plan a trip out of town to a place you’ve never been before. Or join a club. Maybe you should read a different kind of book, or visit a museum. Cosmic activity in one of the most social and thoughtful parts of your chart is encouraging you to expand your world.
 

"
18 august 2018,virgo,"Problems in your love life and financial situation could ease up, thanks to a stellar Mercury-Venus aspect. It’s a great time for talking things over with people or brainstorming solutions. When the Sun enters your sign next Thursday, it’s all systems go.

19 august 2018,virgo,"If you have felt a tad confused, or haven’t been sure which direction to head in, you can breathe a sigh of relief. The reason for the mental mess was that Mercury was retrograde in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. It goes direct today, just in time for your birthday season, which begins on Thursday.

"
21 august 2018,virgo,"If you need to have a serious talk with a lover, today is a good day to do so. Wise old Saturn is in a good position to help you discuss long term plans. If you’re looking for love, a new flame could be out there, someone who could go the distance.

"
22 august 2018,virgo,"It’s one thing to love someone; it’s another thing to obsess over them….or what they’re up to. Don’t let fears get the better you today. The Moon has been in a very emotional spot lately, blowing things out of proportion. Once the Sun rolls into your sign tomorrow, you’ll be feeling stronger and more resilient.

"
23 august 2018,virgo,"Yay! The Sun is now in your sign, crowning you the celestial favorite. What’s going to make this birthday season so different from those of the past is the cosmic emphasis on love. Pluto, Saturn and red hot Mars are all in this part of your chart. The next four weeks are awesome for finding new love, jazzing up an existing relationship or even having a baby.

"
24 august 2018,virgo,"Matters of the heart can get quite intense today, and this can either be a good thing or a bad thing. If jealousy and drama take over, you could spend the day fighting with a lover. But if you channel this energy correctly, you could have the time of your life. Singles, the next three or four days are excellent for meeting someone new.

"
25 august 2018,virgo,"When the Sun is in someone’s sign–like it is for you right now–it can be easy to just focus on what you want, and to strike off on a solitary path. But cosmic activity this weekend indicates that people will want to join you on your journey, and if you’re smart you’ll take them along. We’re talking about lovers, friends and new connections (and these people know how to dream big).

"
26 august 2018,virgo,"Relationship issues are now front and center, thanks to tonight’s full moon in your house of commitment. The message behind this lunation is that you need to be on equal footing with a lover. Head trips and power plays have to go, along with enabling someone and unstable conditions. If someone can’t go along with that, then you may need to make some changes.

"
27 august 2018,virgo,"You’re not willing to let someone else call the shots when it comes to romance. And why should you? Ambitious Mars is in this part of your chart and goes direct today, making you more determined than ever to have a love relationship go your way for once. Just make sure that you don’t get too pushy though, a possibility under the circumstances.

"
28 august 2018,virgo,"Your sign is famous for its practical nature, which means that you can sniff out a phony person a mile away. Today’s cosmic energy indicates that a passive aggressive type may be in your midst. No need to freak out over this; just calmly observe them. But don’t get involved in any of their suggestions, as they’ll be looking out for #1.

"
29 august 2018,virgo,"From your chart it appears that you need to loosen up your grip on things, Virgo. This could be relationships with a lover, family members or kids. It could be your future goals. Maybe you’re desperately awaiting an outcome of some kind. Let things take their natural course and relax more.

"
30 august 2018,virgo,"Balancing a calm exterior with turbulent inner emotions could be difficult today! But it needs to be done, so keep calm and carry on. Tomorrow is a better day for doing things your way, fierce and proud.

"
31 august 2018,virgo,"Your motivation rises to create sweeping changes. Sitting around waiting for things to improve just isn’t going to cut it for you. So dive in, and if anyone is holding you back, push them to the side.

"
1 september 2018,virgo,"You may be overly concerned about your reputation these days, but is there really any basis to your worries? When shrewd Mercury enters Virgo this coming Wednesday you’ll be able to see things from a higher perspective.

"
2 september 2018,virgo,"If you’re feeling like “The Little Train That Could”, that’s because a strong lunar aspect is encouraging you to dig deep and do more. You’re capable of quite more than you may realize. Open your eyes.

"
3 september 2018,virgo,"If there is a plan you have in mind, something that you’d like to achieve, then push forward silently. There is a time and place for going public, but it’s not now. That time arrives on the 9th when the new moon occurs in your sign.

"
4 september 2018,virgo,"You know what you want and what you like…..so why are others trying to talk you out of it? Don’t pay attention to the opinions of others, no matter how well meaning they may be. It’s also possible that they’re a little jealous of you and your ideals.

"
5 september 2018,virgo,"The Sun has been in your sign for some time now, but now Mercury joins the birthday party. This is going to speed up your mental process. The next few weeks are awesome for strategizing and planning the future. Start now, because the new Moon on the 9th is when the doors open.

"
6 september 2018,virgo,"Ready for taking a chance on love? Over the past few months stern Saturn has been retrograde in your house of romance. You may have been thinking over what you need in matters of the heart. Or maybe you were taking a breather from the whole scene! Now it’s time to dive back in and have some fun, as Saturn has gone direct.

"
7 september 2018,virgo,"Hurricane Virgo is here! Nothing, and I mean nothing, is going to stop you today. Inspiration strikes a big as brilliant Uranus is churning out ideas. Your magnetism is high due to the Sun and Mercury in your sign. And mature Saturn is in a wonderful aspect from your house in talent, showing the world that you have the chops to get the job done. Gotta love it!

"
8 september 2018,virgo,"Part of you wants to do things the old way, yet another part wants to charge off into brave new territory! Don’t worry, this cosmic energy passes quickly. Tomorrow’s new Moon is in your sign, and it opens up a six month period in which you can figure out what’s best for you.

"
9 september 2018,virgo,"Yasss!!!! The annual new moon in Virgo takes place today, and it’s a honey. It enables you to plant the seeds of new endeavors. In a sweet cosmic twist, Venus enters your house of thinking, planning and networking too. Considering that this planet governs love, you should be on the prowl for meeting someone new, or having more fun with your amour.

"
10 september 2018,virgo,"Yesterday’s new Moon was in your sign, and chances are you are raring to go. And today energetic Mars blasts into your house of efficiency. You are going to become a force of nature! But that doesn’t mean that everyone around you shares your level of motivation, or that they’re interested in the same things. Be aware that you may be doing some things by yourself.

"
11 september 2018,virgo,"The stars are aligning perfectly for you over the next few days, Virgo. Two days ago there was a new Moon in your sign, which is opening up doors that may have  been firmly shut. And today the Sun is winking at lucky Jupiter, dousing you with charisma. It’s a wonderful day for showing off your skills. It’s also well aspected for love, so don’t let them charisma go to waste.

"
12 september 2018,virgo,"With generous Jupiter and magnetic Venus in the most open and expressive part of your chart, you’re willing to put yourself out there. This is smart, as it can help you get ahead in your career and love life. Will everyone be thrilled with your ideas? No. Expect some resistance, but don’t let it stop you.

"
13 september 2018,virgo,"Your patience will be running thin with people who are trying to push their own agenda, Virgo. But that’s not going to stop them from trying! Don’t allow others to use fear or guilt to get their way. If you need to set someone straight, wait until tomorrow or Saturday to do so.

"
14 september 2018,virgo,"A battle is brewing between your need for comfort and security, and the desire to take a few chances. This isn’t surprising, considering that the fiery Sun is in your sign. The smartest thing you can do is take some baby steps toward something that excites you, rather than leaping in head first.

"
15 september 2018,virgo,"This is one of the best years ever to get involved in activities that make your heart sing. Hobbies, sports, art classes, learning how to cook, gardening—all of these are recommended. It can’t be all about work all the time. Make a promise today to set aside time every weekend (or maybe every day) for something that relaxes you.

"
16 september 2018,virgo,"Remember what the genie said to Aladdin: “Your wish is my command?”  Well, at least one wish. Virgo, you’re in a smokin’ hot position to get your wishes granted over the next 48 hours. But as they say in the selling business, “You don’t ask, you don’t get.” Wise words—pay attention to them.

"
17 september 2018,virgo,"Flirting and playing the field can be fun, but it also has its drawbacks. Today you’re going to be craving more security (and sanity!) when it comes to love. Whether you’re single or attached, consider what you need to make that happen. Wednesday of this week happens to be an auspicious time to get your way.

"
18 september 2018,virgo,"Remember when your mother used to say, “Just because your friends jump off a bridge, should you do the same thing?” Well, Virgo, it’s that kind of a day. Except this time it’s not your Mama saying this, it’s Mars and Uranus. The bottom line is that you need to think things through carefully. This is not a good day for making snap decisions.

"
19 september 2018,virgo,"The Sun will soon be leaving your sign, but that’s not something to be upset about. Today that fiery orb forms a fabulous angle with the Moon, encouraging you to chase after things that are on your bucket list. So pick a few items and get to work.

"
20 september 2018,virgo,"This is a wonderful day for forming connections with other people, especially for love or business. Abundant Jupiter is encouraging open discussions and tossing around ideas, while Neptune is stirring up inspiration. Don’t be too hasty, though, to make any big decisions. Wait until the Sun enters your sign on Thursday.

"
21 september 2018,virgo,"Show me the money! Now that shrewd Mercury is in your income sector, it’s time to start seeing more green. You’re in an excellent position to build wealth, serious money. But first you need to look at your spending and savings habits. If you’re sloppy with them, you’ll never develop a strong foundation.

"
22 september 2018,virgo,"You need to become a lot more serious about your money situation, Libra. This may be easier than you think. The Sun enters your income sector today, so the next four weeks are well aspected for boosting your earnings and savings. But you have to watch out for needless or extravagant spending, especially next week.

"
23 september 2018,virgo,"You need to get serious about saving more cash, Virgo. Tomorrow’s full moon occurs in your house of creating wealth. A Saturn-Mercury aspect today warns against spending on swag and unnecessary goodies. You have to start somewhere! Focus on the essentials only.

"
24 september 2018,virgo,"People who stand in the middle the road get run over, Virgo.  You need to make a decision–about your financial situation or love life, from the looks of it. Tonight’s full moon will push you into making one. As for money, you do have the talent to earn more. And you don’t have to stay in a less than stellar relationship. Give yourself more credit than that.

"
25 september 2018,virgo,"Do you even know how to have fun anymore? From your chart it appears that you’re really doing way too much, to the point where you can’t relax. This needs to come to an end, pronto. If you have to, block out time every day just for yourself: for hobbies, sports or hanging out with you care about.

"
26 september 2018,virgo,"A happy lunar aspect enables you to take care of miscommunications today. Over the past week or two it may been hard to express yourself. Other people may have been moody and difficult. But now you have a chance to speak your mind, so go for it!

"
27 september 2018,virgo,"You can’t assume that bosses or clients know how fabulous you are, Virgo. There’s nothing wrong with a little shameless self-promotion. So ask for the raise for the order. Ask for the job or the responsibility. You can handle it.

"
28 september 2018,virgo,"Don’t assume that you can say anything to anyone today, Virgo. Even the most innocent remark could be taken the wrong way. Are people being way too touchy? Probably. But you don’t want to make any enemies.

"
29 september 2018,virgo,"Do the rules need to be rewritten in a close relationship? It sure looks that way from your chart. The good news is that common, mature Saturn is in a good position to help you. And you won’t need to beat someone over the head to get your point across. Keep calm and carry on.

"
30 september 2018,virgo,"It’s time to deal with facts, not fiction.  So if anyone is blowing smoke up your rear end, you need to set them straight. You’ve got places to go and people to meet, and you don’t have time for any nonsense.

"
1 october 2018,virgo,"It’s one thing to help another person, and another to enable them. Despite your best efforts someone may not be appreciative of what you’re trying to do for them. Don’t forget, you have your own needs, which includes peace of mind.

"
2 october 2018,virgo,"Your sign is famous for being rational, and this is a good thing. You’re going to need all of the common sense you can muster today, not to mention a cool façade. People could be dramatic, annoying or dictatorial. Don’t get involved in their messes and head trips.

"
3 october 2018,virgo,"It’s Wednesday… officially known as hump day. If you need a little bit more fun to get you through the week, look no further than your friends. A sparkling Moon-Venus aspect is just the ticket for a fun night out on the town, or lunch with the girls. As the Beatles sang, “I get by with a little help from my friends.”

"
4 october 2018,virgo,"There could be a sudden change in plans today, something that could throw you off your game, if you let it. People could also be opinionated and not willing to see the big picture. Once Mercury enters your communication sector next Tuesday, you’ll be able to get back on track.

"
5 october 2018,virgo,"You are going to have to choose. Your. Words. Very. Carefully.  No, Mercury isn’t retrograde, but Venus sure is! In your house of communication too. Your brain could be operating more on emotions than rational thought. Think carefully before you lash out at someone.

"
6 october 2018,virgo,"The Moon is in your sign this weekend, which should  put a smile on your face. But other people may be talking in circles, and your frustration could be rising. If need be, go solo. Just worry about yourself and your own happiness. Everyone else can wait.

"
7 october 2018,virgo,"Opposites attract, but do they always get along? Pay attention if you feel as though you have to change who you are in order to get along with someone. It may not be worth it.

"
8 october 2018,virgo,"Don’t jump in where angels fear to tread, Virgo. Today’s new Moon occurs in your income sector, encouraging you to pulling more cash. But a tough Uranus aspect warns against doing anything too risky. Vet new opportunities carefully and take your time before you dive in.

"
9 october 2018,virgo,"The next three weeks are excellent for self promotion, thanks to Mercury entering your communications sector. Yesterday’s new Moon was in your income house, so now’s the time to talk yourself up. The rest of October is also excellent for communicating with loved ones. Looking for love? You can find it right in your own backyard.

"
10 october 2018,virgo,"“Why am I surrounded by idiots?”   That thought may enter your mind as people spout stupid opinions and come up with totally unrealistic plans. Trying to make progress on group efforts will be difficult, so don’t waste your breath. Wait for tomorrow when the aspects are better for talking sense to others.

"
11 october 2018,virgo,"Let your passion show today, Virgo. Whether it’s your love for another person or a pet….or a hobby that inspires you…or a career that makes your heart sing. Pull away from work and your responsibilities, and just enjoy life a little.

"
12 october 2018,virgo,"Try to be a little more flexible when it comes to dealing with your nearest and dearest. If you hit them up with too many rules or expectations, you run the risk of coming off like a tyrant….even if you feel as though you’re 100% justified.

"
13 october 2018,virgo,"You can sit around and pine for the good old days when things were better, but what’s the point? You can’t get that time back. And the planets are moving into a fun, social spot tomorrow and in the early part of the week. So focus on enjoying life today.

"
14 october 2018,virgo,"Looking for the real deal in love? This week is well aspected for matters of the heart, starting today. Mature Saturn is trying to help you develop a strong bond with someone….whether you’re already attached or not! Singles, Friday the 19th and the weekend that follows is super for tracking down a keeper.

"
15 october 2018,virgo,"A light touch will go further than a heavy handed one, Virgo. Whether you’re promoting your brand, asking someone for a favor or talking to a lover, easy does it. This coming Friday is also a wonderful time for communicating and gaining cooperation.

"
16 october 2018,virgo,"Creativity is a gift that we humans have been given. So how come you’re not digging into your well of talent enough? A Moon-Pluto aspect is perfect for exploring new ways of expressing yourself. Over the next five weeks you could be surprised at what pours out of you!

"
17 october 2018,virgo,"You’re not one to step away from hard work. And now that the Moon is in your house of efficiency, it’s all systems go. Don’t be surprised if others witness your can-do spirit and want to partner with you! People know a winner when they see one.

"
18 october 2018,virgo,"There are only 24 hours in a day, so think twice before you take on any more responsibilities. The problem is that red hot Mars is blazing through your productivity zone, making you think that you can do it all. Slow down and reconsider your options.

"
19 october 2018,virgo,"Passion can flow today and so can words of love and encouragement. A lovely Neptune-Mercury trine is perfect for digging deep into your well of emotion. But talking about practical details? Not so much! So forget about the small stuff, and focus on the sweeter side of life instead.

"
20 october 2018,virgo,"“Can’t you see, baby you and me, we got a groovy kind of love!” Those are lines from an old song by The Turtles back in the 1960s. Love could certainly get groovy today, thanks to a passionate embrace between the Moon and Neptune. Take this energy and run with it! And if you’re looking for love, next week has some awesome aspects virtually every day.

"
21 october 2018,virgo,"Romance could take a nice turn over the next few days, Virgo! Abundant Jupiter is in a good mood in your house of communication, allowing you to express your desires and affection. If you’re single, the best place to meet someone new is right in your neighborhood. And the best part is that this energy continues on for another month.

"
22 october 2018,virgo,"If you need to make some tweaks to your life, try more creative approach. Doing things the same old way is just going to bring you more of the same old stuff. You’re ready for some fresh beginnings, so open up your mind to new possibilities.

"
23 october 2018,virgo,"Feeling more talkative? Willing to put yourself out on a limb and express yourself fully? It’s not surprising. The Sun has just entered your house of communicating. But don’t try to change the world overnight, or take on unnecessary risks. Slow and steady is the way to go.

"
24 october 2018,virgo,"It’s time to bring closure to some of your biggest, most audacious plans. The full moon in Taurus is your annual opportunity to make things happen that are BIG: a trip around the world, say, or going to medical school. Writing that book. Starting a business. Finding new love. If you need advice don’t be afraid to seek it.

"
25 october 2018,virgo,"Your life can really use a creative reboot! A sparkling Moon-Pluto trine will help you get in touch with your dramatic, artistic side (yes, we all have one). Start coloring outside the lines. Take a few risks. And don’t be afraid to let people see the new you!

26 october 2018,virgo,"You can absolutely charm the birds from the trees with today’s Sun-Venus connection. It’s a wonderful time to share your feelings with anyone, but lovers especially.

"
27 october 2018,virgo,"Who cares what other people think. Screw it! A powerful Sun-Saturn aspect encourages you to speak your piece. Stop hiding in the shadows, and start living a more colorful life.

"
28 october 2018,virgo,"You’re not going to let anything stop you. If an obstacle gets in your way, you’ll go around it, under it or above it. And the best part? You’ll make it look ever so easy!

"
29 october 2018,virgo,"Decisions, decisions! With Lucky Jupiter winking at lively Mercury, you could find yourself in a situation where there are plenty of options. Don’t let anyone pressure you, though, into choosing one. Make your own decisions.

"
30 october 2018,virgo,"Don’t worry about trying to please anyone today. With a Moon-Pluto opposition, it will be damn near impossible! Just worry about yourself for a change.

"
31 october 2018,virgo,"People could be highly opinionated today, and you simply won’t be in the mood for it. Intelligent Mercury glides into your house of comfort, demanding peace of mind. So walk away from the braggarts and egotistical divas. Enter into your own private temple of serenity.

"
1 november 2018,virgo,"From your chart it appears that you need to have more fun, and today’s the day to do so. Find people who know how to look at the brighter side of life and make plans to get together with them. You may need some down time on Friday and Saturday, making today a smart time to socialize.

"
2 november 2018,virgo,"You don’t owe anyone anything, so don’t fall victim to guilt trips coming from people close to you. Push them aside and do your own thing this weekend. When the new moon arrives in Scorpio next Wednesday, you’ll be a lot more interested in socializing and talking with others.

"
3 november 2018,virgo,"It’s nice to be popular, but you really don’t feel the need to fit in. So don’t be afraid to go your own way today. Take a little break from the human race, because you’re going to be thrust into the middle of things on Tuesday.

"
4 november 2018,virgo,"Your ability to remain calm, cool and collected will increase. Intelligent Mercury is cruising through one of the most mental parts of your chart, helping you see things for the way they are. Why fight battles when you can remain on the sidelines?

"
5 november 2018,virgo,"If you have something to say, say it. From your chart it appears that other people need to hear some straight talk. Don’t be afraid of hurting their feelings or upsetting their plans; they will benefit from what you have to say.

"
6 november 2018,virgo,"Emotional issues from your past may come back to be dealt with today, Virgo. High octane Uranus retrogrades into one of the most psychological parts of your chart, a place where it was earlier in 2018. You really need to clean up any old baggage that is holding you back. Otherwise you’re going to be stuck, like a dog chasing its tail.

"
7 november 2018,virgo,"Ready to talk? I hope so, because today’s new Moon takes place in your house of expression. This includes the way you write, speak and think. If you need to get a message out there, you are now in great position to do so–through social media, marketing materials, or your art portfolio. Between now and May you can cover a lot of ground. This aspect is also wonderful for opening up the lines of communication in romance.

"
8 november 2018,virgo,"Home is where the heart is, Virgo! Abundant Jupiter is now in your house of domestic matters. Over the next year you could move, buy a place, settle family arguments or start a family of your own. Love can also take a more serious turn as you decide to move in with someone or get married. A calm sense of contentment could also be yours for the having.

"
10 november 2018,virgo,"Don’t assume that just cause something seems to be going slowly that will not succeed. Sometimes it takes us a while to realize that it’s for the better. Trust that everything is unfolding at the right pace.

"
11 november 2018,virgo,"Are you ready to take some chances? You should be! With transformational Pluto activating your house of creativity, you should be viewing life in a brand new light. If you have any doubts as to what you should do, hash it out with a friend. With the Sun in your house of brainstorming, you’ll be able to figure it out.
 

"
12 november 2018,virgo,"If you ever read the book The Wizard of Oz, you know that Dorothy thought that Kansas was dull and boring. Which is why when they made the movie, the Kansas scenes were shot in black and white. But once she got to Oz, her world was full of color. You are going through the same process right now. The cosmos is urging you to put a lot more color and creativity into your life.

"
13 november 2018,virgo,"Make sure you pitch in and do your share, Virgo. With generous Jupiter active in your house of cooperation, this should not be a problem. Show people that you are a team player, and it will come back to you in a positive way.

"
14 november 2018,virgo,"When it comes to domestic matters, try to build bridges instead of burning them. With a optimistic Jupiter now in your house of family matters, it should be easier than usual to reach an agreement. Besides, who needs the stress?

"
15 november 2018,virgo,"There’s a mixed bag of energy in the cosmos! High octane Mars moves into your house of commitment, making you very focused on serious relationships. But Mercury will retrograde tomorrow in your house of domestic matters. You will need to maintain a delicate balance between romance and family issues.

"
16 november 2018,virgo,"Try not to deal with a domestic or romantic situation aggressively. As a matter of fact, if you can put these kinds of discussions off until early December, you’d be better off. That’s because Mercury is now retrograde in your house of family and residence. Step away from known troublemakers; good advice with the holidays right around the corner!

"
17 november 2018,virgo,"Career and money matters start to develop momentum, Virgo. Venus, planet of profits, is now direct in this part of your chart. Things will get even more firmed up with the full moon on the 22nd. That happens to be Thanksgiving, but don’t be afraid to close deals or make major decisions that week.

"
18 november 2018,virgo,"It’s one thing to care about other people. It’s another to get sucked into their dramas. You can only do so much for other people, Virgo. At some point they have to figure it out for themselves. The full moon coming this Thursday will make that crystal clear.

"
19 november 2018,virgo,"Feeling torn between personal and professional goals? Like you don’t have enough time for loved ones and your career? This energy will build, reaching a crescendo on Thursday. The full moon that day will demand a resolution.
 

"
21 november 2018,virgo,"Things may not be working out exactly as you expected them to, but that’s no call for worry. Brilliant Uranus is active in the most psychological part of your chart. You’ll be able to figure away around any challenge that comes your way.

"
23 november 2018,virgo,"Family and residential matters are going to pick up steam next week, so get ready for just about anything. Don’t forget whom and what’s most important, Virgo…..and it’s not work and your office!

"
24 november 2018,virgo,"A battle could be brewing as loved ones are clamoring for more time and attention from you. Ask yourself if they have any good reason for wanting more, or if they’re pushing their luck. You will have some important decisions to make next week. Get your priorities straight right now.

"
25 november 2018,virgo,"People could be getting on your nerves, Virgo. Seriously. If that’s the case, don’t feel badly about pulling away and spending the day alone. There is a lot of planetary activity in houses that govern your relationships with other people. Set aside some quality time for yourself.

"
26 november 2018,virgo,"Peace, serenity, contentment…all of these can be yours in the year ahead. Today is considered to be one of the best days of the year in astrology. The Sun and mighty Jupiter form a conjunction in your house of domestic bliss, which also happens to govern your inner sense of stability. But Mars is in a tough angle from your house of serious relationships, indicating that you may need to put certain people in their place if you want to be happy.

"
27 november 2018,virgo,"This is a terrific time to release pent-up feelings and emotions. With verbal Mercury forming a perfect angle with healing Jupiter, you should let it all hang out. You deserve inner peace.

"
28 november 2018,virgo,"Romance gets a huge boost from a Saturn-Sun aspect. Saturn is the planet of longevity, the orb that wants to create happiness over the long term. It’s in your house of romance, and it smiling at Mars in your house of commitment. You’ve got some seriously warm and fuzzy stuff going on!

"
29 november 2018,virgo,"The Moon is in your sign and you should be feeling sexy and strong! This is a good day to show the world what you’ve got, and that includes your smarts as well as your charisma. You can impress people wherever you go, so work it, honey.

"

"
24 march 2018,libra,"The game players are out in force, so don’t allow yourself to become a victim of their manipulative tactics. Likewise, you  need to keep things on the straight and narrow too. Try to steer clear of known trouble makers.

"
26 march 2018,libra,"Chances are you won’t feel like playing nice today. It’s not that you’re trying to be difficult; it’s that the demands of others just seem ridiculous. Tomorrow is a much better time for cooperation, not only on your end but from other people.

3 april 2018,libra,"Start bringing more passion into your work, Libra. Whether your job title is “stay at home mom” or “CEO”, it’s time to throw yourself into what you do. And if your current job isn’t worth that effort, then find one that is.

"

"
6 april 2018,libra,"Judging other people is a pretty easy thing to do, but you need to avoid coming to snap decisions. People may have been pushing your buttons lately and no doubt you’ve come to some conclusions about them. Pay more attention to your own path through life instead of theirs.

"
18 april 2018,libra,"Flying solo is not the way to go, not when the Sun and Uranus are pushing you to partner with a like minded individual.

Yup, all the skeletons could start coming out of the closet, so consider yourself warned. On the plus side you can put old squabbles to rest if you’re so inclined. If others want to remain mired in drama that’s their choice.

"
23 april 2018,libra,"If you’re going to share your time with other people, Libra, it’s critical that they “feel like home”.

The full moon on Monday will help you gain clarity….and will chill you out.

"
28 april 2018,libra,"“The squeaky wheel gets the grease!”  That old saying popped into my mind today when I looked at your chart. Someone may be quite pushy today, demanding to get their own way.

"
29 april 2018,libra,"In astrology there are several houses that deal with your mindset and emotional state. Lucky for you, happy planets occupy these houses, setting the stage for you to develop more serenity and contentment. A Sun-Saturn trine suggests that you create “happiness habits” that you stick with religiously: a daily walk in nature, perhaps, or reading a good book in bed before you drift off to sleep. Do whatever works!

"
30 april 2018,libra,"Ready to cash in? Tonight’s full moon in your income sector could bring the raise, new job or business idea that you’ve been waiting for.

"
1 may 2018,libra,"Yesterday’s full moon in your income sector set up an awesome two-week period in which you can make headway with finding a new job, a raise or increasing revenues in your business. But keep spouses, lovers, and business contacts out of things, if you can. Too many chefs will spoil the sauce.

They need to figure things out for themselves, and they won’t if you keep rescuing them.

"
3 may 2018,libra,"You’re about to enter one of the best times in your entire life to build your net worth. Once Uranus changes signs on the 15th, it’s all systems go!

"
12 may 2018,libra,"They say that no one knows best how to push your buttons like family, and today is one of those days. Lovers could be on the warpath too, or acting wonky. My advice? Spend the day just taking good care of yourself!

"
21 december 2018,libra,"Family first? It sure looks that way, now that the Sun is in your house of loved ones and your residence. The key is to open up the lines of communication, easy to do today with a helpful Jupiter-Mercury aspect.

"
22 december 2018,libra,"Christmas may be right around the corner, but your thoughts are on career and other important goals. That’s because tonight’s full moon occurs in your house of ambition and success. Lucky Jupiter isn’t a fabulous aspect, bringing together the people and the resources that you need to pull things off.

"
23 december 2018,libra,"Sometimes our path in life is hidden by so many layers that we can’t see what’s ahead. But in the next week or so, you should be able to make some sense out of what’s going on. It could be an “aha!” moment or something that slowly reveals itself. But either way, you will have clarity.

"
24 december 2018,libra,"Leave extra time today to get things done, especially if you’re counting on other people to help. They might flake out and forget to do things. Or they may simply slack off. Either way, you’ll need a buffer zone.

"
25 december 2018,libra,"Merry Christmas, Libra! The Moon is in Leo, your eleventh house of friends and camaraderie. Christmas is family time of course, but in your case you should schedule some down time with the tribe. The weekend is perfect for hanging out with friends and  a lover.

"
26 december 2018,libra,"Red hot Mars will be entering your house of serious relationships on New Year’s Eve. If you’re already involved in a romantic relationship, things could heat up. And if you’re single, you could meet The One. However, you could get a taste of what’s to come as of today, thanks to energetic Uranus stirring things up in this sector. Expect the unexpected.

"
27 december 2018,libra,"New Year’s Day is coming and everyone is setting their resolutions for 2019. But you are ahead of the game, thanks to motivational Mars in your house of habits and routines. If you’re thinking about a career change, a terrific Mars aspect today will help you explore other options.

"
28 december 2018,libra,"It may seem that other people  have the upper hand at the moment. As a result, you need to tread warily when dealing with them. No problem. Gentle, charismatic Venus is on the job. Smile and cooperate….for now, anyway.

"
29 december 2018,libra,"If you’ve been burning the candle at both ends, it could come back to you this weekend. Seriously, you need to start taking better care of yourself. With red hot Mars in the well being part of your chart, it’s critical to give your health the respect it deserves.

"
30 december 2018,libra,"People could be acting downright wonky today, and you won’t be in the mood for it. Considering that Mars enters your house of relationships tomorrow, there are certain people who may need to be set straight. You’re not stuck in the role of the zodiac’s diplomat.

"
31 december 2018,libra,"Got the urge to merge? Now that Mars is in your house of serious partnerships, just about anything can happen. Don’t be surprised if someone suggests some kind of business alliance over the next few weeks. Romantic connections can deepen too. If you’re single and looking, 2019 could be the year it happens.

"
5 january 2018,scorpio,"Past hurts wash away more easily, thanks to gentle Venus gliding through your sign. Better yet is that a sense of fun will start to emerge. Considering that Sunday’s solar eclipse is going to occur in the most social part of your chart, you will more in the mood for mingling with others.

"
7 february 2018,scorpio,"
Your luck takes a turn for the better thanks to abundant Jupiter in your house of stability. Keep on keeping on….you’re on the right track.

"
8 march 2018,scorpio,"Lucky Scorpio—you’ve enjoyed abundant Jupiter in your sign since last October. It will be there until November, helping you completely overhaul your life and pursue your deepest desires. But today it stations retrograde through July 10th. Does this mean that everything is going to fall apart? Hell no! Instead, this is a super time to rethink your plans and make revisions.

"
9 march 2018,scorpio,"Nothing, and I mean nothing, is going to get in the way of you making more money, Scorpio. With the Moon meeting up with motivator Mars in your income sector, you are more than ready to start earning more cash. But don’t forget that Jupiter is now retrograde in your sign, indicating that you may change your plans over the next few months.

"
10 march 2018,scorpio,"Don’t be shy about asking others to pitch in and help, Scorpio. You weren’t put on this planet to be someone’s maid. If others even think of making excuses or try to guilt you, let ‘em have it. Then hand them the mop, food shopping list or work assignment and tell them to get off their sorry a**.

"
11 march 2018,scorpio,"It may be time to reconsider how you communicate with others, Scorpio. The same old way of talking to your kids, or writing term papers, or negotiating a deal may not be working. Whether you’re the type who withholds information or screams and yells, it’s time for an upgrade.

"
12 march 2018,scorpio,"You’re beginning to realize how limitless you truly are as the Sun ramps up your creativity and optimism. Avoid trolls and others who say that “it can’t be done”. It can  be done; they’re just too blind or lazy to see it.
 
 

"
13 march 2018,scorpio,"Bending the rules may seem like a good plan, but other people may not agree. No matter how smart or creative your ideas are, or how much time and money they might save everyone, others will be stuck in the past. The question is this: do you want to remain stuck there with them?

"
14 march 2018,scorpio,"Acting like a stubborn four-year old won’t get you anywhere today, so watch out for the tendency to sulk or vent. Once outspoken Mars rolls into your communication sector on Saturday, then  you can mouth off. Although you might be over it by then!

"
15 march 2018,scorpio,"You may need to dole out some tough love to people in your world, Scorpio. This holds true for kids and a lover, but also people you work with. There may be some good old “creative differences” (as they say in Hollywood) at the office. Everyone needs to get on the same page, especially before you sign deals or make big presentations.

"
16 march 2018,scorpio,"Grrrrr!!! Your sign is famous for its sexuality, and today’s a good day to work it. A luscious Moon-Neptune aspect is just the ticket for anything from flirting to downright seduction. Work and tasks can wait for another day.

"
17 march 2018,scorpio,"A sweet, social time begins for you Scorpio! The new moon in Pisces occurs in your house of creativity, having more fun and developing romance. And Mars barrels into your house of socializing and self-expression. The next few months are super for singles who are looking for love and couples who need to share more quality time together. Creatives, developing your talent and selling your work are well aspected too.

"
18 march 2018,scorpio,"The recent new moon on Saturday occurred in your house of romance, opening up doors for more fun and love to come your way. So why do you feel like you don’t deserve it? Chiron, the wounded healer, is active, that’s why. Let these silly notions go.

"
19 march 2018,scorpio,"It may be a Monday but the cosmos doesn’t care. A happy Mercury-Venus aspect tells you to flirt, have fun, go out for cocktails or take in a movie. Feel like calling in sick? Why not!

"
20 march 2018,scorpio,"If your life hasn’t been as organized as you’d like, it’s time to start getting your act together. The Sun is now in your super practical sixth house of efficiency. Don’t even try to procrastinate: you can run but you can’t hide! Mercury begins to retrograde in the same sector on Thursday, forcing you to get caught up on projects and develop better habits.

"
21 march 2018,scorpio,"You may feel a bit sluggish over the next few weeks, so protect your health. Get plenty of sleep, nutritious food and aerobic exercise. If you’re dealing with issues that might require a doctor or physical therapist, make those appointments now. The full moon on the 31st is the best time all year to put an end to aches and pains.

"
22 march 2018,scorpio,"Being organized and on top of things could be a challenge over the next few weeks! Mercury just went retrograde in your house of efficiency. Create to-do lists instead of going from memory. Pay attention to habits or systems that simply aren’t working. Back up data and don’t leave flash drives laying around.

"
23 march 2018,scorpio,"If you’re not careful, Scorpio, co-workers and family members will be more than happy to dump their work on your tired shoulders. And they could be pretty brazen or forceful about it too! This is not the time to give in. If you do, you’ll become their go-to maid for the next ten days.

"
24 march 2018,scorpio,"Don’t jump in to something too quickly without performing due diligence, Scorpio. Mars is making you antsy to get moving with plans but in your haste you could overlook important details. Keep this in mind over the next week.

"
25 march 2018,scorpio,"Jupiter may be retrograde in your sign but that doesn’t mean that you should be hiding in a bunker somewhere. On the contrary! A spunky Moon-Jupiter connection urges you to consider some new adventures, which I’m sure your creative mind is capable of.

"
26 march 2018,scorpio,"Getting people to agree on a work project, or to go along with a particular goal of yours, may be difficult today. Save your breath! Things improve tomorrow and get even better on Wednesday.

"
27 march 2018,scorpio,"What seems like a setback today may not be one by tomorrow. With so much planetary activity in your achievement zone, you’re anxious to get moving, but temporary slowdowns give you the chance to reexamine what you’re working on.

"
28 march 2018,scorpio,"The sudden desire to become healthy, fit and sexier could hit you today, and if you’re smart you’ll run with it! This is the best time in 2018 for Scorpios to eat more nutritious foods, take up a new sport and get more shuteye. Not only will you have more energy, your brain will become sharper too.

"
29 march 2018,scorpio,"Paralysis by analysis could occur as you start to obsess over details. Sure, you need to do things right, but at some point you have to get moving. And if creating a few rules would actually help you make progress, then think differently!

"
30 march 2018,scorpio,"Patience is a virtue, something that my grandma used to tell me all the time. And that’s what the cosmos is telling you today, Scorpio! This is especially true with a lover or child. Tomorrow’s full moon could provide you with insight that you need.

"
31 march 2018,scorpio,"Buh-bye! Tonight’s full moon is one of the best times all year to chuck things that aren’t working for you. As one door closes another one opens. You might want to start with your love life as Venus glides into your house of commitment today too. Great day for talking things over, or for singles to meet someone locally.

"
1 april 2018,scorpio,"Bad habits need to go, Scorpio. So do inefficient systems, lazy employees and anything or anyone that wastes your time. Speak your piece today and tomorrow while the aspects are good. But from Wednesday on, say little.

"
2 april 2018,scorpio,"Once those words leave your mouth you can never take them back. The same goes for texts and e-mails. With pushy Mars eager to vent, you run the risk of saying too much too soon. Slow down and consider the consequences of your communications.

"
3 april 2018,scorpio,"You may feel as though you have all the answers but if you’re smart you’ll seek someone’s opinion. They may be able to help you dig deeper into an issue and come up with better intel or solutions.

"
4 april 2018,scorpio,"Ouch! Watch the tendency to come off as being too opinionated or aggressive today, quite a possibility with Mars in a feisty mood. Cooperation with others does  count. Don’t come off as you’re looking out for #1–even if you are!

"
5 april 2018,scorpio,"Don’t be so tough on yourself. Stern Saturn is pushing you to create better ways of going about things but you’re not going to get it right every time. Practice makes perfect.

"
6 april 2018,scorpio,"You need energy to get things done and the cosmos is telling you to deepen your reservoir of vitality. It’s one thing to talk about taking good care of yourself, and another to actually do it. Quit wasting time.

"
7 april 2018,scorpio,"What’s more important in your life…quantity or quality? You’re in a place tight now of paring down and only wanting to deal with the essentials–essential people, activities and emotions.

"
8 april 2018,scorpio,"Stepping into your own power is becoming easier thanks to strongman Pluto is your house of thinking and communicating. A positive aspect today helps you get clear about what to do next, and how to express this to others.

"
9 april 2018,scorpio,"Avoid petty arguments if you can; they’re simply not worth it today. People may be acting unreasonable and you don’t have to be like Pavlov’s dog. Responding will only pull you in deeper.

"
10 april 2018,scorpio,"Your true path in life is being revealed to you, so if you’re smart you’ll pay attention! This is especially true when it comes to your career. Look out for #1 these days.

"
11 april 2018,scorpio,"Best date night of the week–heck, maybe even the month! Sexy Venus winks at macho Mars across the heavens, setting the stage for romance. Singles, get off the damn computer and head out to an event in order to meet a serious contender. Face to face meetings beat online sites for you right now.

"
12 april 2018,scorpio,"Yum! A juicy meeting of the two love planets, Venus and Neptune, puts you in the mood for amour. Whether you’re single or attached, get yourself all dolled up and make some plans for the evening. Can’t do anything tonight? Don’t worry. This energy carries on for a few more days.

"
14 april 2018,scorpio,"Creativity soars with a Mars-Neptune aspect, so put yours to good use. This could mean getting into a hobby, redecorating your abode or completely changing your look. If you work in a field that demands artistic sensibility, now’s the time to polish up your skills and portfolio.

"
15 april 2018,scorpio,"Life may have been hectic lately to the point where you’ve ignored your health or your to-do list. Now’s the time to get back on track and bring some order into your daily life. Mercury goes direct in your efficiency zone!

"
16 april 2018,scorpio,"If you’ve been feeling overwhelmed by errands and unfinished projects lately, the time has come to get caught up…and even ahead! A sparkling new moon occurs in your efficiency zone, and from the looks of it you’re going to massively overhaul the way you get things done. People around you may resist your efforts, but that’s their problem.

"
17 april 2018,scorpio,"What you say, how you say it and how your present yourself to the world is about to change, Scorpio. Wise, mature Saturn begins to retrograde in your house of self expression. This is especially fortuitous for anyone who’s developing a brand or who is involved in the arts. They say that appearances are everything; make sure that you come off like a pro.

"
18 april 2018,scorpio,"Slogging through chores or office projects can often seem like a grind, but today you could hit upon a brilliant idea for making them go much more quickly. It could be an app, a new website or a time management technique. Maybe you need to hire an assistant. Pull it together and enjoy a less stressed lifestyle.

"
19 april 2018,scorpio,"Your sign has a reputation for being mysterious and pulling away from the madding crowd, but is that always a good idea? High energy Mars is in your chatty house of self-expression. Why not consider opening up a little bit?

"
20 april 2018,scorpio,"The “rules” of your closest relationships are about to undergo change, Scorpio. Now that the Sun is in Taurus, your house of diplomacy and commitment, you should be considering the ways that you relate to others. Do you need to be more present and spend quality time with your tribe? Or do you need to step away from being an enabler, the peace maker, the go-to person who’s always doing the grunt work? Reflect on this and make the appropriate changes.

"
21 april 2018,scorpio,"A message the cosmos is sending your way is that you must be more circumspect about the information that you put out there. It could be your opinion, resume, text messages, term papers or business plan. It could be what you say and how you say it. There is no need to reveal everything, and that which is revealed needs to be on point.

"
22 april 2018,scorpio,"So much is being said about people developing their “brand” that the term is becoming meaningless. Seriously, does everyone have to be a walking billboard, advertising their bad self? Not you, that’s for sure. Now that Pluto has gone retrograde in your house of self expression it’s all about being authentic. But first you need to uncover what “authentic” means to you.

"
23 april 2018,scorpio,"Refining the way you come across in business situations is important right now., Scorpio. You want people to only see the best you have to offer. As a result this may mean handling crises more calmly, polishing up your negotiating skills or updating your website and marketing materials.

"
24 april 2018,scorpio,"Grrrrr!!!! Romantic Venus glides into your house of intimacy and sex, settling in for an amorous three week stay. You might be feeling a bit selfish in the love department these days as next week’s full moon occurs in your sign. If a lover isn’t giving you what you need, maybe it’s time to move on!

"
25 april 2018,scorpio,"People around you may be hell bent on following the same old procedures or sticking with the same old tired ideas. You, on the other hand, seem to be full of smart efficiency hacks and concepts. Your ideas will fall on deaf ears so don’t waste your time. Tomorrow is a better time to get your point across.

"
26 april 2018,scorpio,"You could end up being quite forceful today with your words….which could be a good thing or a bad thing. Aggressive Mars and powerful Pluto meet up in the heavens, either turning you into a tyrant or a silver tongued persuader. Make sure that you choose wisely.

"
27 april 2018,scorpio,"Your common sense is telling you one thing, and your emotions another. Which one to go with? I’d say to go the rational route. The Moon is in a wonky angle, creating fears, drama and “gut feelings” that are off base.

"
28 april 2018,scorpio,"If you’re not sure of the facts, don’t say anything. Got an outrageous opinion? Keep it to yourself. A Moon-Mars square warns against being too vocal. This includes bright ideas, too. You’re much better off keeping them to yourself, at least for the next week.

"
29 april 2018,scorpio,"Anyone who thinks that you’re a pushover is in for a big surprise, Scorpio! These days you really  mean business, and you’re not afraid to let that fact be known. If you need to set boundaries, put people in their place or go public with something that has been bothering you, now’s the time to do it.

"
30 april 2018,scorpio,"Once a year everyone gets to enjoy a full moon in their sign, and tonight’s your night! This lunation is extra special as amorous Neptune is in a fabulous angle from your house of love, flirting and having fun. Abundant Jupiter is also well aspected, putting you in the spotlight. Now’s the time to get your name and ideas out there.

"
1 may 2018,scorpio,"The full moon in your sign yesterday was full of creativity, fun and self-expression. The next two weeks could see you doing a lot more socializing, flirting and developing your talents. But Uranus is in a cranky mood from your efficiency sector, warning that you’d better not forget to get the grunt work done.

"
2 may 2018,scorpio,"You could become easily offended today by something that a person says or does, and your emotional state might be funky for the rest of the day. A Moon-Saturn conjunction tomorrow is a better time to put others on notice that you aren’t allowing chaos and drama into your life.

"
3 may 2018,scorpio,"If you feel as though your business needs to be rebranded, or that your personal look could be updated, now’s a good time to consider fresh options. Jupiter, planet of abundance, is retrograde in your sign, which is actually a perfect aspect for creating changes.

"
4 may 2018,scorpio,"It is time for a change, and the only way it’s going to happen is if you seize the reins. Stop waiting for a white knight to ride in on a horse: it ain’t gonna happen. Fortunately planets in your strategizing sector are active, so figure out what needs to be done and get to it.

"
5 may 2018,scorpio,"Read between the lines! Don’t take everything you hear at face value, Scorpio. There are things going on behind the scenes that you need to ferret out. Fortunately detective-like Pluto is working the case with you.

"
6 may 2018,scorpio,"Who says that dreamers are fools? With Neptune active in your house of creativity and romance, your day dreams can manifest into something quite juicy and exciting. You’ve never been one to run away from passion, art or showing off your talents. Dive in, Scorpio.

"
7 may 2018,scorpio,"Someone may be forceful with their words today, not operating with logic but with uppity attitude. Avoid getting pulled into a battle with them as there will be no satisfaction in it. Might doesn’t make right.

"
8 may 2018,scorpio,"Lucky Jupiter is in your sign, but one of the downsides is that it can make you feel as though you’re a one-person force of nature. The reality is that you need the cooperation, approval or backing of other people. Next week’s new moon in your partnership zone will help you get along with folks who can help you on your journey.

"
9 may 2018,scorpio,"The lines of communication open up nicely today, especially with loved ones. You’ll be able to get your point across with strength, humor and caring. It’s also a winner for exploring your creative talentS and letting them shine.

"
10 may 2018,scorpio,"You’ve got talent, Scorpio—why not really tap into it? Once Uranus moves into Taurus next week, partnering with others will one of the best ways to showcase your goods all the way into 2026.

"
11 may 2018,scorpio,"When Uranus moves into your highly collaborative seventh house next week, your best work will be with partners—all the way through 2026! But you can get a jump start on things today by opening up the lines of communication. This includes lovers too, so air your feelings and opinions.

"
12 may 2018,scorpio,"Haste makes waste, Scorpio. Your grandma may have told you that in the past but today the cosmos is on your case about it. The faster you try to get something don’t, the more screw-ups there will be. Take your time and do things the right way.

"
13 may 2018,scorpio,"Don’t hold back! Megamouth Mercury is now in a sector that deals with some of your deepest thoughts and emotions. You’ll be able to express yourself logically without a lot of drama and finger pointing. The next eight years of your life will be the most cathartic ever, so take that risk and speak up.

"
14 may 2018,scorpio,"The cosmos gives you one last push to get organized and streamline your life. Brilliant Uranus has been in this sector for the past eight years, but it moves on tomorrow to a new locale. Create some solid new habits that will help you get things done more quickly and serenely.

"
15 may 2018,scorpio,"If you think you knew your lover, guess again. If you’re single and think you know what you want from a suitor, your ideas may change radically. Unpredictable Uranus is now in your commitment sector, bringing serendipity and more open-minded thinking when it comes to matters of the heart. A lover could shock you, thrill you or exasperate you… all the way into 2026!

"
16 may 2018,scorpio,"Your personal life is about to become all warm and fuzzy, Scorpio. A new moon just occurred in your commitment house and tomorrow Mars starts touring your home and family sector. Creating a beautiful home and a more contented family life will become more important to you. Don’t forget to book some precious personal time too!

"
17 may 2018,scorpio,"Things could get heated within a business or personal relationship—and you could react angrily. Hot headed Mars is in your house of contentment, which is already a mismatch. So if someone pushes your buttons you might fly off the handle. This battle isn’t worth it, so walk away.

"
18 may 2018,scorpio,"Perfect day to express what’s on your mind, whether it’s in a business setting or a personal one. The two most logical and direct planets, Mercury and Saturn, are aligned so that you can present yourself and your ideas with a calm power.

"
19 may 2018,scorpio,"If you’ve been feeling boxed in lately—by work stress, family demands, health issues or anything else—that’s about to change. Venus has just entered your house of freedom, optimism and breaking the rules. Venus isn’t a rebel; she does things quietly, elegantly. And so can you.

"
20 may 2018,scorpio,"Oh yeah! Scorpios are known for their sexy demeanor and today the Sun enters your house of libido and intimacy. (Funny, I don’t hear any of you complaining.) The next four weeks ought to be pretty interesting considering that amorous Venus entered your house of adventure yesterday. Have fun.

"
21 may 2018,scorpio,"Sometimes ya just gotta let other people know who’s boss, Scorpio….and today is one of those days!  The good news is that you’ll be able to assert a quiet, calm authority without resorting to tyrannical tactics. Your word is your bond and others sense this.

"
22 may 2018,scorpio,"There’s no holding back your feelings today, so let ‘em out! Whether they will be well received is another issue, but keeping things in isn’t healthy. People need to know where you’re coming from and what you expect.

"
23 may 2018,scorpio,"Someone close might accuse you of having your head in the clouds, and the problem is—they may be right! Sunny Jupiter in your sign is filling your brain with rainbows, unicorns, puppies and angels. So if someone tells you to get a grip, they’re on to something.

"
24 may 2018,scorpio,"A happy Sun-Mars trine makes this one of the best days in 2018 to speak from the heart. Take care of problems within your family or romantic relationship. Make serious plans for the future. Real estate matters are well aspected, so if you’re looking to move or remodel, start making plans now.

"
25 may 2018,scorpio,"Creativity, charisma, connecting—all of these get a huge boost from today’s beyond fabulous Jupiter-Neptune trine! These two planets rarely form this angle, so work it, honey. If you feel like creating a brand new look and attitude, do so—and expect results by August 19th, at which time this aspect happens again!

"
26 may 2018,scorpio,"You’re in no mood these days for people verbally abusing you or playing games. Fortunately the two most powerful planets in the solar system, Pluto and Saturn, are in an excellent spot in your house of self expression. Which means that you shouldn’t suffer in silence! Calmly state your case and tell malcontents to back off.

"
27 may 2018,scorpio,"Breaking the rules could create problems that you don’t want to have to deal with, Scorpio. Your secretive sign is masterful at pulling things off without others knowing, but a stern Saturn-Venus opposition warns against doing so over the next 48 hours.

"
28 may 2018,scorpio,"Financial projections need to be rock solid, Libra. Don’t make important fiscal decisions based on emotions or airy-fairy thoughts about what you’d like  to see happen. Tomorrow’s full moon in Sagittarius will shed light on things, and since Sagittarius is your house of brainstorming and negotiating, you’ll be in a good place to move forward.

"
29 may 2018,scorpio,"In astrology there are two houses that govern money, and today you have action in both! The full moon occurs in your income sector just as shrewd Mercury zips into the wealth building one. The next few months are well aspected for finding a new job, starting a business and making wise investment decisions.

"
30 may 2018,scorpio,"Practicality reigns, thanks to the energy of yesterday’s full moon in the stability-seeking part of your chart. Other people may result to drama, guilt trips or passive-aggressive behavior in order to derail you. I wish them a lot of luck….it ain’t happenin’.

"
31 may 2018,scorpio,"The time is right for saying what’s on your mind, Scorpio. You tend to hold things in, making people sweat as they try to decipher what’s going on in that brain of yours. But with chill Saturn putting the right words in your mouth, don’t hold back.

"
1 june 2018,scorpio,"If you have something to say to a lover, family member or roommate, now’s the time! A wonderful Mercury aspect allows you to open up and get your feelings out. You’ve grown tired of shaky situations and drama. If you want to create more stability in your life, you have to let others know that.

"
2 june 2018,scorpio,"Knowing what you want is half the battle, Scorpio! Some highly optimistic cosmic energy is opening your eyes to a plethora of goodies to chase after. Be decisive and narrow down your focus.

"
3 june 2018,scorpio,"Your sign is famous for being able to hide your true feelings and thoughts, but that just isn’t going to happen today! An energetic and passionate Moon-Mars connection is going to make you spill, but this is a good thing. Other people need to know where you stand. They’re not mind readers, you know.

"
4 june 2018,scorpio,"Shaking yourself loose of negative juju is a lot easier when the illuminating Sun and common sense Mercury are on the case. Conveniently, they are in a good spot to help you today as they form a perfect line in the heavens. Drama and chaos are going to start looking a lot less attractive.

"
5 june 2018,scorpio,"This is not a good day to try to break the rules, Scorpio. Make sure that everything you say and do is right on point, faultless. This is especially true about the written word. Mercury isn’t retrograde but tyrannical Pluto is on the warpath in your house of communicating.

"
6 june 2018,scorpio,"It could be hard to get a straight answer from someone close, and this could fray your nerves. You seem to be coming from a pretty logical place thanks to hosting the Sun and Mercury in your house of emotions. But others may be in full drama/diva mode, so put on your seatbelt!

"
7 june 2018,scorpio,"Beware the green-eyed monster, whether it resides in you or has taken over someone else! Jealousy ain’t pretty, my friend. If this is an emotion you’ve been experiencing, the new moon next Wednesday is the perfect time to start doing the inner work necessary to get rid of it.

"
8 june 2018,scorpio,"With the Moon in the sportiest part of your chart you should be getting off the sofa this weekend and getting into action. This is an auspicious time to start a diet or make a vow to get more sleep. With next week’s new moon occurring in your house of sex, now you have you yet another reason for getting toned!

"
9 june 2018,scorpio,"Don’t kid yourself about discipline. Scorpio. The word conjures up images of hard work and denial, but sticking to a plan yields results! The ancient Taoists and Buddhists called this “process”: sticking to a routine, accepting the boredom of it, and then happily patting yourself on the back in the end.

"
10 june 2018,scorpio,"It may have been a bit confusing lately to sort out the truth from the BS, but things are starting to turn around. Looking at the sunnier side of life becomes more easy once Mercury enters Cancer on Tuesday. Your confidence will rise and the murkiness other people are putting out won’t bother you as much.

"
11 june 2018,scorpio,"If anyone even suggests that you can’t do something–or that your ideas are crazy–feel free to hand them a ration of whoop-ass, Scorpio! The planets are lining up later this week to take you into exciting, unchartered territory. You don’t need any anchor-like people holding you down.

"
12 june 2018,scorpio,"Taking calculated risks is in the stars for you, Scorpio! Today Mercury glides into your house of advanced thought, and tomorrow Venus enters your house of ambition. Everything is lining up nicely for you to score in two big life areas: romance and net worth.

"
13 june 2018,scorpio,"Your sign is famous for its passion and sexuality, and today is your annual new moon in the house of libido! The next few months could be quite passionate, but without drama, jealousy and other nonsense. That’s because amorous Venus enters your house of stability and tradition today also. Buh bye, bad boys and divas.

"
14 june 2018,scorpio,"Close relationships could get a little testy with a Venus-Uranus square. People may not agree about the long term, or how a certain situation should be handled. This isn’t a deal breaker but it’s important to listen to the other person’s point of view. From your chart it appears that you may be too opinionated over the next few days!

"
15 june 2018,scorpio,"The two most logical planets in the solar system, Mercury and Saturn, are at war with each other. This could create delays in big plans as people may not know which direction to head in. Fortunately this energy changes by Tuesday, at which time you may need to take control and point out the way to everyone else.

"
16 june 2018,scorpio,"An insanely creative period in your life will begin next week, and you may already be feeling it! If you’re an artist naturally this is good news. But everyone needs to tap into their own personal well of talent, whether at work or at home raising your kids. You will be pushed past previously held personal notions of what you were capable of. Bravo!

"
17 june 2018,scorpio,"People may be interested in giving you advice, telling you to change your life this way and that. They may mean well but the final decision comes down to you. Take the next four weeks to consider your options, then swing into action when Leo season begins in late July.

"
18 june 2018,scorpio,"Romeo, Romeo, wherefore are thou? Now that confusing Neptune is retrograde in your house of romance, you may be wondering which end is up in love. But don’t get too bogged down in drama. If you’re looking for a fresh start there’s one to be had.

"
19 june 2018,scorpio,"Generous Jupiter may be retrograde in your sign but that doesn’t mean that your luck has run out! The next few days are fabulous for growth and expansion, so don’t hide in the shadows. With intelligent Mercury in your house of taking risks, you can make progress in areas that may have seemed impossible before.

"
20 june 2018,scorpio,"Your creativity and sense of adventure are on the upswing. This is a good time to study the game book of someone you admire, whether they’re alive or not—the great explorers, artists, scientists, authors and bon vivants. What is about them and their lives that you could emulate? What risks could you take? Once the Sun changes signs tomorrow you should start to incorporate these into your life.

"
21 june 2018,scorpio,"If you feel like flying off into the wild blue yonder, boldly going where no man has gone before (Star Trek!) or launching an entrepreneurial start-up, blame it all on the Sun entering your ninth house of risk taking. You might also try on a new lover for size, write a book or get another college degree. A Venus-Mars opposition indicates that you’re ready to buck convention, so don’t be afraid to show the world some cutting edge ideas.

"
22 june 2018,scorpio,"Your love life gets a boost from spunky Uranus, the planet of serendipity. Try some new adventures when it comes to date nights or traveling on vacation. Singles, cultural events are the best way to meet someone this weekend, not doing errands, so knock out your tasks and then head to an art gallery, museum or concert.

"
23 june 2018,scorpio,"Sometimes you just need to keep to the script and not make any big changes, Scorpio. Today is one of those days and so is next Wednesday. Play the game, even if it kills you. Don’t worry. This won’t last long! Within a week’s time you’re back on top again.

"
24 june 2018,scorpio,"It’s always a good thing when the cosmos is telling you to go out and party with your friends, and that’s what you should do today! Spend time with people who share your outlook on life. And there could be some new friends that you’ll make along the way.

"
25 june 2018,scorpio,"This is no time to kid yourself about the direction something is going in, Scorpio. The two most optimistic planets, Venus and Jupiter, are at odds, indicating that you might not be seeing things clearly. This is especially true of major goals or dreams. When Mercury changes signs on Friday clarity will return.

"
26 june 2018,scorpio,"Need a breather from the family unit? That could be the case now that Mars is retrograde in your domestic sector. There is  such a thing as too much togetherness, so if your nerves are frayed by roommates, parents, siblings or a lover, then take some time for yourself.

"
27 june 2018,scorpio,"The words you speak–or write– could have long lasting consequences, so be mindful of what you put out there. Things are heating up in your house of success and you don’t want to blow it!

"
28 june 2018,scorpio,"The full moon could bring about a series of happy events over the next two weeks: meeting someone new, going away on a trip, landing the job or university of your choice, or watching a pet project get the approval it deserves. But make sure that you don’t over extend yourself, a possibility under this aspect.

"
29 june 2018,scorpio,"The Leo time period is the best of the year for your sign to go after big plans and dreams, and it’s three weeks away. But start strategizing now, as clever Mercury enters Leo today. Talk to the people who can help you make things happen. Start setting things in motion. You’ll be glad that you did.

"
30 june 2018,scorpio,"Someone close may throw you a curve ball today, something that you fear will derail your plans. Before you panic know that the cosmic mood changes tomorrow, a better time for talking things over.

"
1 july 2018,scorpio,"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, so pour on the charm, Scorpio! You’ll still be able to get your way, and the other party will think things are being done their way. The bottom line is that you win.

"
3 july 2018,scorpio,"Life is looking a lot sunnier thanks to a Moon-Jupiter trine! There are even more adventurous, romantic and culture-filled days ahead, so start making time in your calendar for them.

"
4 july 2018,scorpio,"Nice things (and people!) are coming your way, and you know what? You deserve them! Today is well suited for romance with a yummy Moon-Neptune connection. Things could get steamier and more dramatic, but this isn’t anything to be upset about.

"
5 july 2018,scorpio,"Your opinions and ideas count, Scorpio…probably more so than you even realize. So don’t be afraid to act on ideas that may have seemed crazy or daring just a short time ago. Once Jupiter resumes direct motion in your sign next week, doors will start to open.

"
6 july 2018,scorpio,"You need to be more flexible with your thinking, especially when it comes to your personal relationships and career. Being too fixated on maintaining the status quo could backfire. Be open to fresh ideas and new connections.

"
7 july 2018,scorpio,"A romantic or business partner to do something unexpected today, Scorpio. Erratic Uranus is acting up in your house of committed relationships.

"
8 july 2018,scorpio,"Sweet! A juicy Sun-Neptune trine is just the ticket for romance. Couples, you should be booking a foreign trip, the more exotic the better.

"
9 july 2018,scorpio,"You’re about to enter a friendly, open time period in which new people will be flooding into your life.

"
10 july 2018,scorpio,"Finally! Jupiter resumes direct motion in Scorpio today. Plans that may have been on hold can now move forward. Truth is, you may be ready to take some risks. Ditch plans and ideas that may been a little bit too safe, and replace them with dreams that are more audacious.

"
11 july 2018,scorpio,"People are more willing to cooperate these days, even some folks that you may have given up hope on. Take this energy and run with it, because the solar eclipse on Friday is in your house of taking chances. You won’t be traveling on your journey all alone–the more the merrier!

"
12 july 2018,scorpio,"With tomorrow’s solar eclipse occurring in the most adventurous part of your chart, chances are you are more than ready to take a few healthy risks. But subterranean Pluto is on the opposite side of the heavens, saying “WTF? Where do you think you’re going so fast?” Since Pluto rules research, the smart Scorpio does their homework before diving into the deep end of the pool.

"
13 july 2018,scorpio,"This is one heck of a week for you, Scorpio. First, Jupiter went direct on Tuesday in your sign, ending log jams in your biggest plans. And today there is a solar eclipse in your freewheeling, adventurous ninth house. If there was ever a time in 2018 to bust out of a rut and take on new challenges, it’s now.

"
14 july 2018,scorpio,"If you need to get on the same page with someone, today is the day to do so. You are playing for keeps, and the people around you need to know that.

"
15 july 2018,scorpio,"Today the cosmic energy is perfect for tossing aside your responsibilities, and heading off for fun with friends or a lover. Spontaneous Uranus is in a good mood, suggesting that you socialize to your heart’s content. This energy runs all week, by the way. Huh…will any work get done? Who cares.

"
16 july 2018,scorpio,"Find a cause that is close to your heart, and commit yourself to it. Ancient astrologers knew that people have charitable hearts; therefore they devoted an entire sector of a person’s chart to giving. Besides, you’ll end up meeting some new people who share your same generosity of spiritArea

"
17 july 2018,scorpio,"You may have unfinished business to take care of, and if you’re smart you’ll deal with it today. The problem is that the Moon is in a touchy place, making you uninterested in getting down to the nitty-gritty. But the Sun will be entering your house of ambition and success on Sunday, all the more reason to start hustling now!

"
18 july 2018,scorpio,"Things may finally start to make sense, Scorpio. Events over the past few months may have twisted your head around. But a terrific lunar aspect today helps you understand things better.

"
19 july 2018,scorpio,"If anyone tries to hem you in today, you will not be in the mood for it! As a matter of fact, those who are foolish enough to try this will be at the end of your stinging scorpion tail. That’s okay. By tomorrow you will have tamed them into submission.

"
20 july 2018,scorpio,"Feeling lucky? You should be, with inspirational Neptune on fire in your house of creativity and romance. Go after what you want. Chances are excellent you will get it!

"
21 july 2018,scorpio,"This is a great weekend for partying with the tribe, Scorpio! For those of you who are looking for love, hanging out with your friends could be the best way to meet someone new. And if you’re happily attached, it’s time to break out of that couple bubble and have a good time.

"
22 july 2018,scorpio,"The Sun is now in Leo, your tenth house of ambition and success. That said, don’t expect fabulous things to happen overnight! Mercury is scheduled to station retrograde in the same sector this Thursday. So start working on your new plans, but give them plenty of time to gel.

"
23 july 2018,scorpio,"Fear of failure needs to go! The emotional Moon may be making you concerned about stability. But you have what it takes to be happy and successful, so let the fears go and jump into a new way of life.

"
24 july 2018,scorpio,"Try to keep people out of your private affairs, Scorpio. They may mean well, but their advice could be way off this week. Now that the Sun is in the most authoritative part of your chart, you are the expert who knows your life the best.

"
25 july 2018,scorpio,"Think twice before you decide to to challenge someone who is in an authority position. You need to have other people backing you up more than you may realize. This is no time to make enemies. Try to be diplomatic, at least on the surface!

"
26 july 2018,scorpio,"Career plans and other big goals may need to be put on the back burner, now that Mercury is retrograde in your house of ambition. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t work on these things. Do some research, think ahead, but don’t forget that you deserve quality time with your family and friends.

"

It could be finding your dream house, starting a family or meeting the person of your dreams. You may also come to the conclusion that you’ve been putting in way too much time at the office. Take care of yourself and your family first.

"
28 july 2018,scorpio,"From your chart it appears that a friend or loved one may need some help, Scorpio. Today the aspects are perfect for holding a meaningful conversation with them. You may need to come on a teeny bit strong, but it’s necessary to help get them back on the right track.

"
29 july 2018,scorpio,"Don’t be surprised if people are a little bit critical today. They may have your best wishes at heart, even though their words may be a bit harsh. It’s also possible that you may need to come down hard on someone close. If that’s the case, be as direct as possible. Sugarcoating things won’t help them a bit.

"
30 july 2018,scorpio,"It may be on Monday, but it sure is a smart time to have fun! Lucky Jupiter in your sign is winking at the Moon in your frisky fifth house. Go ahead: flirt, go out for dinner, shop and gab with your friends. Why not call out sick while you’re at it?

"
1 august 2018,scorpio,"Someone or something could throw you a curveball today, and it could leave you feeling unsettled. Or worse– – you may want to lash out at someone.

"
2 august 2018,scorpio,"If you want to be less stressed, you’ve got to get caught up on little things around the house and the office that have been building up. With the Moon in the most efficient part of your chart, it should be easy to dig in and make some progress.

"
3 august 2018,scorpio,"Someone could be critical today, and you could take it to heart. But from your chart it appears that you’re dealing with some people who have big egos! Let them blow all the hot air they want. It’s not worth getting bothered about.

"
4 august 2018,scorpio,"How you get along with others in a deep, committed relationship is going to be a focus point over the next few months. Today a Moon-Uranus aspect could really make you think long and hard about what you’re expecting out of a partnership, be it personal or professional. Should you rely on yourself more? Or should you be more willing to cooperate? You’ll soon find the answers to those questions.

"
5 august 2018,scorpio,"You need to get crystal clear on the direction you’re going to be heading in next. There is a lot at stake right now, and with a solar eclipse arriving soon in your house of success, you have to have a solid idea about what you want to achieve.

"
6 august 2018,scorpio,"Your sign is famous for its ability to pull away from the madding crowd. And now that gentle Venus is in the most secluded part of your chart, you maybe even more interested in some alone time. But that doesn’t mean that you’ll be locked up alone in a garret! Spending some time behind closed doors with a loved one is also in the stars.

"
7 august 2018,scorpio,"A couple of months ago, rebellious Uranus entered your partnership sector. This may have stirred out the desire for more independence within a personal or professional union. Or perhaps you’ve wanted to rewrite the rules of a relationship. Today it goes retrograde, allowing you to do so. All relationships need recalibration from time to time. Now you have the opportunity to do so.

"
9 august 2018,scorpio,"With gentle Venus in your house of fantasy, it may be difficult to separate fact from fiction today. But that’s exactly what you are going to have to do. You’re better off mulling things over rather than speaking your mind, or asking questions. Be observant.The actions of others will speak louder than their words.

"
10 august 2018,scorpio,"Watch that you don’t offend people in positions of power today, Scorpio. With abundant Jupiter in your sign, you may think that you could say or do just about anything. Nope! Diplomacy counts right now. Use it.

"
11 august 2018,scorpio,"Every year each sign gets one new moon in their house of goals and achievements. And yours is today! But this isn’t just any new Moon.

"
12 august 2018,scorpio,"You may be raring to go, thanks to yesterday’s solar eclipse in the most ambitious part of your chart. But you need to cool your jets.

You may discover that your ideas or plans don’t mesh with their’s, at least not right now. But this doesn’t mean that things are going to fall apart. It just means that you need to have an open discussion about where things are going.

"
14 august 2018,scorpio,"You may not be in the mood for pushing too hard today, and that’s fine. Chances are you just want to sit at home with a good book and a glass of wine.

"
15 august 2018,scorpio,"Someone may try to push your buttons today, and it will be easy to react emotionally. The Moon is in the most sensitive part of your chart.

"

"
19 august 2018,scorpio,"Your career and other big goals will start to develop momentum this week, Scorpio. That’s because Mercury goes direct today in your house of achievement and success.

"
20 august 2018,scorpio,"Now that Mercury is direct in your career sector, you can make a lot of progress. A super Jupiter-Neptune aspect is just the ticket for letting your creativity rip.

Whatever you do, don’t stay home!

"
24 august 2018,scorpio,"You could get quite mouthy today, which could be a good thing….or a bad thing! Brazen Mars is acting up in your communication sector, prompting you to express yourself: verbally, in writing or even through the arts. As a result, use care when it comes to self expression. You need to impress people and get along with them, not make enemies.

"
25 august 2018,scorpio,"You’re in an incredibly strategic spot right now, especially when it comes to meeting the “right people”….whatever that means to you! You could bump into your future spouse, join a volunteer group for a cause that’s close to your heart, or connect with industry people who can help take your career to the next level. The energy is good all weekend and into next week too.

"
26 august 2018,scorpio,"Full moons are famous for shining a high watt spotlight on a particular area of your life, and tonight’s lunation occurs in your house of romance and creativity. A tense Venus-Pluto square indicates that you need to be crystal clear about where people are coming from, whether it’s a lover or someone involved in a work project. Demand answers.

"
27 august 2018,scorpio,"Getting your point across becomes a heck of a lot easier now that Mars is moving direct in your house of communication. Business deals may have been held up, along with discussions involving loved ones. Co-workers may have had their heads stuck in the sand and you may have been at a loss to figure out your next move. It’s all over now, so start telling people what they need to do….and what you want!

"
28 august 2018,scorpio,"With happy-go-lucky Jupiter in your sign, you should be feeling pretty good about the world. But a Mercury-Jupiter square indicates that someone around you could be cranky, to the point of being critical. Honey, that’s their sh**. Don’t let it become yours.

"
29 august 2018,scorpio,"The magic is in the message! If you need to get a point across–to your kids, customers, lover, colleagues or followers–then adjust the way you communicate with them.

"
30 august 2018,scorpio,"Venus is gliding through your house of fantasy and the subconscious mind. This isn’t a problem if it results in a few daydreams here and there, but it is an issue if you are veering off into rainbows-and-unicorns land. Try to keep things real.

"
31 august 2018,scorpio,"It’s one thing to be assertive and another to be aggressive. With volatile Uranus active in your chart, you run the risk of mowing people over with too much attitude or demands. Take a few steps back and remember to be polite!

"
1 september 2018,scorpio,"Someone or something could set you off today, but think twice before you go down the warpath. You may need certain people more than you care to admit. Don’t alienate anyone whose assistance you might need down the road.

"
2 september 2018,scorpio,"It appears that you’ve managed to impress people in positions of authority. The question is—do you really care? From your chart it appears that you may be more interested in doing your own thing. The good news is that you have the ability to impress a multitude of people, and in doing so you can move along your path much faster.

"

Don’t forget that you need some “me” time also.

"

On a social level, this could mean friends or people from charity or volunteer work. On a romantic level it could mean a lover… or someone who you have in mind! Industry contacts can play an important role in your career path, so text them or attend a seminar.

"
12 september 2018,scorpio,"The two most generous and optimistic planets, Jupiter and Venus, are active in your sign today. You have so much charisma that it’s almost shameful! On top of that, you also have the gift of gab. That makes today one of the best times in 2018 to make a big ask, get your point across or promote yourself.

"
13 september 2018,scorpio,"You may love someone dearly, but that doesn’t mean that you should put up with their antics. If you are expecting cooperation, the truth or rational behavior from others, you might be disappointed! Walk away from it today. Then deal with it on Saturday, a much better time for logical talks.

"
14 september 2018,scorpio,"Watch your tongue today, Scorpio! Aggressive Mars is active in your house of communicating, and you could end up biting someone’s head off. Furthermore, people may be acting erratically, which could push your buttons. Keep calm. Tomorrow is a much better day.

"
15 september 2018,scorpio,"You may need to seize the reins in some kind of family or group activity, but that’s OK. Someone’s gotta do it, and right now you’re the person with the best ideas. Let everyone know what their roles and responsibilities are. Once you do that, things can go full speed ahead.

"
16 september 2018,scorpio,"The more, the merrier. The next few days are excellent for connecting with people whom you already know, and also meeting new ones. A lot of your happiness and success over the next few months will result from sharing your time and efforts with others.

"
17 september 2018,scorpio,"You’re in a great position to have your opinions heard. You’ve been developing a lot of wisdom lately, the kind that people need to hear. Others can benefit from what you have to say. Get it out there.

"
18 september 2018,scorpio,"Don’t push it, Scorpio. With aggressive Mars in your house of family and romantic security, you could be in a demanding mood. You run the risk of coming off too strong. Wait until tomorrow, a much better day for communicating to others what you need.

"
19 september 2018,scorpio,"Make a promise to introduce yourself to at least three new people today, Scorpio. You never know where these new connections will take you. You’ve been working hard as of late, and deserve some down time in the company of people you enjoy and admire.

"
20 september 2018,scorpio,"If you need something today, don’t be afraid to ask. Maybe you need a favor. Perhaps you desire someone’s expert opinion. Or maybe you need somebody to lend a hand. Stop trying to do everything yourself.

"
22 september 2018,scorpio,"Having trouble making up your mind? It wouldn’t be surprising under current planetary energy. The Sun has just entered your dreamy, intuitive twelfth house. Yet stern, serious Saturn is telling you to pay attention to the logical left side of your brain. This vibe will continue into next week so don’t even try to make any major decisions!

"
23 september 2018,scorpio,"Your intuition is razor sharp these days, but this doesn’t mean that you should act on it. Let the information flow in. Consider it carefully. You still need more time to make major decisions.

"
24 september 2018,scorpio,"Right now you are being pulled between fact and fantasy, Scorpio. Wise old Saturn is telling you to think logically. But Mercury is dreaming up all sorts of rainbow-and-unicorn type of ideas. Tonight’s full moon is going to snap you out of this mess right quick.

"
25 september 2018,scorpio,"Ideas, opinions and other things that you used to take for granted are changing. That’s because the fiery Sun is illuminating a new set of possibilities to you. Hey, you can resist it all you want, but eventually you’ll find out that El Sol was right!

"
26 september 2018,scorpio,"The cosmos is demanding that you take better care of your health, Scorpio! Don’t worry, you’re not on the verge of a major illness or operation. But you do need to tweak your diet, exercise regimen, and sleeping patterns. Do it now and within a month you’ll be feeling fabulous.

"
28 september 2018,scorpio,"If you’re feeling a little independent these days, don’t be surprised. A Moon-Jupiter opposition is stirring up your desire to do things your way. That may be because you’re in a far more efficient place than they are! Or perhaps you have more focus. Either way, don’t be afraid to do your own thing.

"
29 september 2018,scorpio,"Ah, peace at last. A meeting of the emotional Moon and logical Saturn is perfect for balancing out your thoughts and feelings. Your thinking will be clear and you will be able to get your point across with ease and sincerity.

"
30 september 2018,scorpio,"Getting in touch with your deepest desires is easy thanks to a sultry Neptune aspect. This sounds sexual, and yes, you certainly can get in touch with your sexy side. But what else do you desire out of life? More adventure? More peace of mind? Consider all of your options.

"
1 october 2018,scorpio,"This is not a good time to be reckless in your actions or words. Even if your brain is popping out one fantasy after another, the smart thing to do is to act like a conservative bore on the outside! When Venus starts to retrograde on Friday in your sign, you will have several weeks to think things through.

"
2 october 2018,scorpio,"You know that old saying about trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, right? That’s the kind of energy you’re dealing with today. Trying to push things along so that they fit your agenda or timetable is just not going to work. Furthermore, you could be dealing with hidden resistance from people who don’t want to see you succeed. Slow down. Work alone.

"
3 october 2018,scorpio,"You will absolutely outdo everyone with brilliant ideas today, which could shock even you! Get used to feeling like the smartest person in the room. Once Mercury enters your sign next week, you’ll have even more bright ideas. I almost feel sorry for the people around you.

"
4 october 2018,scorpio,"You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink, Scorpio. No matter how hard you try to open up someone’s eyes, they’ll see what they want to see. And they’ll hear what they want to hear. Don’t waste your time.

"
5 october 2018,scorpio,"Not feeling as sexy and charismatic as usual? Fear not, Scorpio. You haven’t lost your sizzle. It’s just that glamorous Venus is now retrograde in your sign, giving your self-esteem a little hit. This will pass soon.

"
6 october 2018,scorpio,"Keep other people out of your personal business. And keep them out of your decision making too. Right now you need to do things that seem right for you, not others. This feeling will get stronger on Tuesday and will last all month.

"
7 october 2018,scorpio,"If there is someone whose style, career or attitude you’ve admired, don’t get jealous! Instead, figure out what they’re doing right. Take some pages from their playbook and make them your own.

"
8 october 2018,scorpio,"Today’s new Moon is the perfect opportunity to toss out situations (and even people) that aren’t working for you anymore. Clear out the cobwebs from your brain and negative circumstances from your life. Tomorrow clever Mercury enters your sign, and it’s time to get moving with things that are important to you.

"
9 october 2018,scorpio,"It’s time to look out for number one. Yesterday’s new Moon was in your house of closure and transition, encouraging you to dump what’s not working. And today intelligent Mercury enters your sign. Start thinking now about what you’d like to experience in your next birthday year.

"
10 october 2018,scorpio,"You should be feeling good about yourself. Mercury and Venus are both cruising through your sign, dousing you with charisma. So why are people being so freakin’ cranky? And why do they seem determined to burst your bubble? It’s due to a tense Uranus opposition. Not everyone is thrilled that you’ve got it going on; they’re jellin’.

"
11 october 2018,scorpio,"It’s always a good thing when people can express themselves with power and dignity, and that’s what you have going for you today. Tomorrow will be a trickier day for you to express yourself, so take advantage of today’s aspect.

"

"
13 october 2018,scorpio,"Arguments about love or money (or egads, both) could arise today. Wait until tomorrow to clarify things. The Moon will then be in one of the most expressive and practical parts of your chart. Better yet, you’ll feel more powerful and in control.

"
14 october 2018,scorpio,"The next week is perfect for saying what’s on your mind, whether you’re talking to a lover or sending out a press release. Today, a positive Saturn aspect will assist you in making the right kind of  decisions about how to get your message across.

"

"
16 october 2018,scorpio,"They say that “the pen is mightier than the sword”. Your words can cut deeper than any knife. They can also inspire and covey love and sincerity. Today, think about the way you get your message across. It’s time for a change.

"
18 october 2018,scorpio,"Pettiness doesn’t suit you, so don’t go down that path. That could be a hard thing to do with a Mars-Venus square. Others could be whiny and childish as well, so avoid known malcontents and stick with the happy people!

"
19 october 2018,scorpio,"This is a wonderful day for love… provided that you keep your family and friends out of your private business! A juicy Mercury-Neptune trine sets the stage for romance, whether it’s with an existing lover or meeting someone new. Be sure to follow your own heart rather than listening to the advice of others, no matter how well-meaning they may be.

"
20 october 2018,scorpio,"What a wonderful weekend the cosmos has cooked up for you! Beauty conscious Neptune is active in your house of pampering, designer clothing and swag. And entertainment. And having fun. And enjoying lots of romance. As a non-Scorpio, I am jealous. Have fun!

"
21 october 2018,scorpio,"Take a good long look at your life and ask yourself if you’re living authentically. Are you able to express yourself fully? Is your career in line with your values? Do the people around you support you? If not, current cosmic activity is perfect for getting things in alignment.

"
22 october 2018,scorpio,"One of the best gifts you can give yourself this cosmic birthday season is to get things out into the open. Seriously, let people know what you’re thinking and feeling. The faster you do that the quicker you’ll relax and enjoy the next four weeks.

"
23 october 2018,scorpio,"Woo-hoo! The Sun is now in your sign and it’s all about you.  But….maybe it’s too much about you! A difficult Uranus aspect could make you a little pigheaded. Or, it could make someone close demanding and perhaps snarky, ready to burst your birthday balloon. It’s up to you to handle this calmly.

"
25 october 2018,scorpio,"Your words convey strength and conviction, Scorpio. This is a good thing as others need to know where you’re coming from. Some powerful aspects between now and Monday will put you in the driver’s seat. Take advantage of this energy, as it will shape your future for years to come.

"
30 october 2018,scorpio,"No matter how convinced how right you are about something, today is not the time to ram your opinions down someone’s throat. Let them figure things out for themselves for once. They may stumble and fall, but that’s what learning is all about.

"
31 october 2018,scorpio,"Peace of mind is going to become a lot more important to you, especially when it comes to love and money.

"
1 november 2018,scorpio,"Do you feel as though things in life are fate? As though they were destined to be? Pay attention to subtle clues from the cosmos today, Scorpio. The laws of karma are on your side.

"
2 november 2018,scorpio,"Separating fact from fiction could be difficult today, not only from others but in your own mind. Your best bet is to wait until Sunday, when the Moon is in the house of intuition. Logical Mercury will also be in a good angle then, allowing for clarity to seep in.

"
3 november 2018,scorpio,"Don’t be so emo! People could be pushing your buttons today, and you could react dramatically. This isn’t worth it, not at all. By the middle of next week you will have forgotten all about this and you’ll be having fun again.

Between now and next May you can develop momentum and witness success in many areas! That rebellious Uranus retrogrades into your house of efficiency today, demanding that you get your act together first.

"
7 november 2018,scorpio,"Yasss!!!! Today’s new Moon occurs in your sign, and it opens up a six month period in which you can chase after any dream of your choosing. Pluto happens to be in a fabulous aspect from your house of communication and self expression. So don’t be shy…let everyone know who you are and what you want.

"
8 november 2018,scorpio,"It’s official… abundant Jupiter has moved out of your sign and is now in Sagittarius. But there is no need for tears. The gas giant is in your sector of earning and saving more money, a place that hasn’t been in over a decade. If you’re smart you’ll start hustling right now. The last week of November could bring some big changes.

"
9 november 2018,scorpio,"Issues or tensions that were bubbling behind the scenes may come to the surface today, but this is a good thing. A productive Mars aspect will help you deal with them calmly and completely. This is especially true when it comes to family or love matters.

"
10 november 2018,scorpio,"There is no reason to play by the rules! Especially since the rules are always made up by other people. You are your own unique individual, and you don’t need to fit in. There’s nothing wrong with being a true original.

"
11 november 2018,scorpio,"Say what you mean and mean what you say! With powerful Pluto in your house of communication, now is the time to get your point across. This is an excellent time for developing your brand and getting a message out there too.

"
12 november 2018,scorpio,"You know best what is right for you. So why is everyone butting into your business? Put a smile on your face, thank people for their advice and do things your way. Then have a good laugh later on when things work out and they’re in a state of shock.

"
13 november 2018,scorpio,"Now that abundant Jupiter is in your house and earning income, you should be focused on seeing more of the green stuff.

"
16 november 2018,scorpio,"The holidays are coming, but that doesn’t mean that you should spend, spend, spend. With Mercury retrograde in your house of income and savings, you need to be careful with your money, more careful than usual. Over the next few weeks job offers and raises could get stalled. Things will start to open up around December 10th.

"
17 november 2018,scorpio,"If you want to get somebody’s attention, sometimes it’s better just to whisper. Going loud and proud of is not always the smartest move. Now that Venus is direct in the most secretive part of your chart, you can gain more ground by being subtle.

"
18 november 2018,scorpio,"This is no time to be wasteful with your money. You could be attracted by all sorts of shiny, sparkly things these days. But with a full moon arriving in your house of net worth, you are being encouraged to save for a rainy day.

"
19 november 2018,scorpio,"Can stability and excitement coexist? That’s the question posed by today’s Mars-Jupiter square. Jupiter wants stability, whereas Mars wants drama. If you can find a way to temper the two, you’ll be in a good place.

"
21 november 2018,scorpio,"Today is the kind of day when you need to suck it up and act like a team member, even if you don’t feel like it. Don’t worry, this won’t last forever. By the time Neptune goes direct this Saturday, you can go back to doing your own thing.

"
22 november 2018,scorpio,"Cool your jets, Scorpio! Tonight’s full moon occurs in one of the most emotional parts of your chart. You may want answers, and you may want commitment. You may want peace of mind. But aggressive Mars is pushing you to demand things to happen NOW. Watch out that you don’t offend people.

"
24 november 2018,scorpio,"If you’ve been ignoring problems within a lover or child, it’s time to wake up! Confusing Neptune has been retrograde in the sector that deals with loved ones, but today it stations direct. Things could still be a bit bumpy next week–especially on Tuesday—but the planets are conspiring to bring you stability and sanity.

"
26 november 2018,scorpio,"Ka-ching!!!! We all love that sound, don’t we. But Scorpios are going to get to hear it more than others over the next year. That’s because abundant Jupiter meets up with the fiery Sun today in your house of income and savings. The next 12 months could be the most potent you’ve ever had for pulling in more cash. It’s up to you to make it happen. One word of warning from the cosmos: don’t spend it all on swag and entertainment, a possibility with Mars in a tense angle.

"
27 november 2018,scorpio,"It’s time to talk turkey. No, not the Thanksgiving kind. I’m referring to money, cash, greenbacks, the almighty dollar. With verbal Mercury meeting up with abundant Jupiter in your house of income, this is no time to be shy. Put yourself out there and grab your share!

"
28 november 2018,scorpio,"Romance gets a huge boost from a Mars-Saturn aspect. Lusty Mars is barreling through your house of flirtation and fun, which could  make you rather footloose. But long term Saturn is on the job, interested in cementing a serious relationship. Singles, this is a good time to meet someone new.

"
29 november 2018,scorpio,"Get other people to pitch in and help you get a job done, Scorpio. If you’re sitting there saying, “Yeah, right, who the hell is going to help me?” you may be pleasantly surprised. If you don’t ask, you don’t get.

"
30 november 2018,scorpio,"A sudden health situation could arise. Nothing major…..but it could make you aware that you need to take much better care of yourself. If you’ve been avoiding diet, fitness and wellness, it’s time to get serious about them.

"
1 december 2018,scorpio,"What big plans did you have for 2018 that you never got around to? Mercury retrogrades into your sign today for a brief period that ends on the 6th. Go back and visit ideas that were brewing in that brain of yours earlier in the year. Then get ready to move forward with some of them on the 12th, when the messenger planet resumes direct motion.

"
2 december 2018,scorpio,"Get ready to be the center of attention. Venus glides into your sign today, ramping up your charisma! It ain’t easy being sexy and gorgeous, but somebody’s got to do it. Just don’t get too full of yourself, a possibility with hot blooded Mars in your house of flirtation and fun.

"
3 december 2018,scorpio,"Magnetic Venus is in your sign and this could drum up drama! But make sure it’s the good kind of drama, not the kind of stuff that belongs in a soap opera. You could become quite emotional due to aggressive Mars charging through Pisces.

"
4 december 2018,scorpio,"Mercury is retrograde in your sign, making you reflect about what you’d like to manifest in the year ahead. You’re capable of achieving much more than you realize. The new Moon on Friday will help you come up with practical ways of pulling off some pretty big challenges.

"
5 december 2018,scorpio,"The Sun is marching bravely through your house of structure and ritual, but pesky Neptune just wants to play around. This could be a day when you’ll be tempted to chuck your responsibilities and call in sick from work. But should you? Probably not!

"
7 december 2018,scorpio,"It’s time to get your money situation squared away. The new moon in Sagittarius is your annual opportunity to start afresh. Create a budget, look for a new job, start a business….do what it takes. But don’t spend the money before you make it. A harsh Neptune angle indicates that you could be swag happy.

"
8 december 2018,scorpio,"Too many options? Way too many people giving you their opinions? If that’s the case, then you may need to pull away from people and get your head straight. Once Mercury enters Sagittarius on Wednesday, you’ll become extremely focused.

"
9 december 2018,scorpio,"You’re capable of so much more than you realize. That’s the message that Chiron, the wounded healer, sends you today. It’s in your house of creativity and talent. If you’re not tapping into that well deeply enough, something needs to change.

"
10 december 2018,scorpio,"With intelligent Mercury in your sign, your brain should be buzzing with ideas. Talk things over with people whom you trust. Get to the bottom of matters. When Mercury changes signs on Wednesday, it’s time to actually do something.

"
11 december 2018,scorpio,"People may actually be willing to cooperate today, as hard as that may be to believe! And you may be motivated to dig in to projects or tasks that have been gathering dust. Get them done now before the holidays reach a fevered pitch.

"
12 december 2018,scorpio,"It’s time to get serious about your future security: the emotional, romantic, and financial kind. Now that Mercury is in the part of your chart that deals with stability, you can buckle down and figure it all out. There was a new moon here recently, so the next two weeks are well aspected for this kind of activity.

"
13 december 2018,scorpio,"Stick to the plan, Scorpio…..whatever that plan may be. This is not the time to try any new routines or ideas. Creativity doesn’t count today; following the rules does.

"
14 december 2018,scorpio,"You might be willing to throw caution to the wind and pursue your desires, Scorpio. The passionate Moon meets up with lusty Mars, encouraging you to live for the moment. But can you afford to do that? If you can, then have fun.

"
15 december 2018,scorpio,"Stand up for yourself, Scorpio. No, really. Your sign isn’t known for being a pushover but from your chart, it appears that you’re putting up with too much guff. Yo can still love someone without being their enabler or doormat.

"
16 december 2018,scorpio,"This is a fabulous week for reworking your image or brand! Get started today, because charismatic Venus is in your sign. Whether you just want to flirt and turn heads, or start a business that takes puts you in the Inc. 500, dive in and keep the momentum going all week.

"
18 december 2018,scorpio,"Whistle while you work! You’re going to have a “Snow White and the 12 Dwarves” moment today as the planets kick you off the sofa and make you get some work done. If you’re trying to finish up your holiday shopping or projects at the office, you’ll receive a sudden burst of energy that will help you wrap things up.

"
19 december 2018,scorpio,"Put in extra effort right now if you want to see bigger bucks in 2019. The Sun will only be in your income sector for another few days, and right now is the time to get things started. By Friday of this week you’ll be far more interested in just socializing!

"
20 december 2018,scorpio,"Time is money. Money talks and bullsh** walks. Money doesn’t grow on trees. You’ve heard all of those sayings, and basically, they’re true. If you want to earn more you need to become a heck of a lot more efficient than you currently are. Fortunately, a terrific Sun-Uranus aspect will shake you out of a funk.

"
21 december 2018,scorpio,"Ready to network? I hope so, because the planets are lining up to put you in the midst of a lot of people.

"
23 december 2018,scorpio,"Don’t worry about what other people think. Your ideas have value, and you don’t need to have the approval of others. This will become more apparent in early January, so get ready to shine.

"
24 december 2018,scorpio,"You won’t be having any visions of sugar plums and fairies floating around in your head, not today—even though it is Christmas Eve! Nope, you’re as practical as can be thanks to logical Mercury in your house of stability. Others, however, may be in fantasy land. You may need to being them back down to Earth.

"
25 december 2018,scorpio,"Tradition may be more important to you this Christmas than usual, thanks to the Moon in one of the most sentimental parts of your chart. This is a good year for creating new traditions that you and your family can follow for years to come, so think of a few! They don’t have to cost money. It’s the thought that counts.

"
26 december 2018,scorpio,"New Year’s Day maybe a week away, but you’re getting ready to roll. Energetic Uranus is prompting you to start taking action by getting organized and cleaning up old projects. Take this energy and run with it, because by tomorrow all you will want to do is have fun.

"
29 december 2018,scorpio,"You deserve the best, and you know it! A happy Mars-Moon aspect today tells you to enjoy life to the fullest. It’s not your karma to suffer, babe. Play hard this weekend, because once Mars changes signs on New Year’s Eve you will be in a far more practical mood.

"
30 december 2018,scorpio,"You’re not invincible, Scorpio. Yeah, yeah, we know. Your sign is famous for death and rebirth, as if you can reincarnate any time you damn well please. The cosmos is telling you to slow down and take better care of your health. When Mars enters your house of vitality and fitness tomorrow, you’ll hit the ground running.

"
31 december 2018,scorpio,"Ready to hit the gym tomorrow? Are you eating one last meal of Twinkies and Nutella before the clock strikes midnight? You can run, but you can’t hide! Mars enters your house of fitness today, setting you up for a successful weight loss program. The only thing that you have to watch out for is trying to do too much too soon.

"
8 march 2018,sagittarius,"It’s time to slow down and take stock, archer. Jupiter begins a four month retrograde in the sector that deals with your subconscious mind. Fears, habits, emotions, past memories, intuition: all of these are found here, and all will be affected. The good news is that Jupiter is healing and abundant.

Likewise, don’t allow yourself to be manipulated into doing something that you’re not ready to do.

"
11 march 2018,sagittarius,"Life may feel constricting, archer, as stern Saturn squares changeable Mercury. You may feel like busting out of old roles and circumstances. This will be a theme running throughout the week. Tomorrow is a winner for coming up with creative solutions.
 
 

"
12 march 2018,sagittarius,"Your intuition is strong this week, and you also might have memories form the past coming back to you. This is all part of a learning process from the cosmos. Examine these old memories and glean knowledge from them, so you won’t repeat the same mistakes.

"
13 march 2018,sagittarius,"You just can’t rely on warm and fuzzy feelings to move forward with something, archer. You need facts and they may be hard to come by today. Don’t let anyone use flattery or nebulous language with you. Demand answers and accountability.

"
14 march 2018,sagittarius,"Ouch! Did somebody say something offensive? Hopefully it wasn’t you, although it’s possible with today’s Moon-Jupiter square. And if the loud mouth was someone else, watch that you’re not overly sensitive to their remarks.

"
15 march 2018,sagittarius,"Get a grip on home-related expenses, Sagittarius. Look for ways you can cut back and then put some money in the bank. The new moon on Saturday falls in your domestic sector, indicating that home decorating projects or moving could be on the agenda. But you’ll need some cash to pull this off, even if it takes a few years to save.

"
16 march 2018,sagittarius,"Time to trawl the design blogs and magazines, Sagittarius! Whether your style is midcentury modern or Victorian antiques, think about ways you can update your home. Tomorrow’s new moon is the best time all year to start redecorating.

"
17 march 2018,sagittarius,"It’s time to get your “house” in order, Sagittarius! This literally means your home, as a new moon occurs in that sector. But you need to get your financial house in order too, which can happen now that Mars is in your house of income, budgeting and saving. Be careful, though—Mars can make you overspend when it’s here, and you need to develop a bigger nest egg.

"
18 march 2018,sagittarius,"It’s not your role in life to play the family consigliere, doormat or enabler. Nor is it your karma to carry around guilt, anger or shame for anything that happened in your childhood. Let it go, as a brighter, happier period is about to begin.

"
19 march 2018,sagittarius,"You’ve spent too many weeks trying to keep other people happy, Sagittarius. The Sun will be moving on tomorrow to a much more festive spot, so get ready to cut loose. Tell people that you’re done taking care of their problems and to take them somewhere else.

"
20 march 2018,sagittarius,"How deep is your love? Now that the Sun is in your house of romance, this is the big question. Don’t try to push your lover for any kind of answer, though: Mercury will retrograde here on Thursday. You can certainly ask questions but don’t twist someone’s arm.

"
21 march 2018,sagittarius,"Your closest connections are under the watchful gaze of the cosmos, archer. Who’s true blue? Do they share the same values as you? The approaching full moon on the 31st could represent a break point with people whom you may have outgrown. That said, some exciting new faces could come into your life.

"
22 march 2018,sagittarius,"Deep emotions could start bubbling to the surface thanks to Mercury going retrograde in your dramatic fifth house. Hissy fits and sulking are the order of the day, either on your part or the part of other people. If you’re not interested in your life turning into a soap opera, then maintain some dignity and tune out the whiners.

"
23 march 2018,sagittarius,"From your chart it’s clear that you need to get a grip on your finances, but there could be factors getting in the way. Maybe it’s your own desire to spend on swag and fun. Perhaps it’s a child who’s guilting you into buying expensive new kicks or tech gadgets. A lover might be more interested in spending than saving. You need to pull it together, stat.

"
24 march 2018,sagittarius,"It’s your emotions versus logic as Mars battles it out with the Sun. This duel could be raging in your own head or between you and somebody else. The next week could be a bumpy road with this, so try to keep calm and carry on.

"
25 march 2018,sagittarius,"Generosity matters, and if you can find it in your heart to be kind to others who are in need, you’ll be creating good karma! Whether you give your time, advice or consolation to someone, you’ll be making this world a better place.

"
26 march 2018,sagittarius,"Steer clear of anyone who pokes fun at your ideas or dreams, archer. You’re in a highly creative phase and your ideas have merit. If others lack vision, that’s simply not your problem.

"
27 march 2018,sagittarius,"Recent lunar activity may find you doubting whether or not you have what it takes to achieve certain things. Living an interesting, rewarding life is  possible, but you’re so overburdened that you can’t see it. A sparkling Uranus aspect tomorrow will set you on the right track.

28 march 2018,sagittarius,"Don’t be surprised if you feel like jazzing up your life with a fresh look, a new hobby or juicier romantic encounters! Spunky Uranus is pushing you to break free from doing things the same old way. What are you waiting for?

"
29 march 2018,sagittarius,"Trying to talk sense into other people isn’t worth it, archer, at least not with today’s cosmic energy. Sometimes people just have to figure things out for themselves. Let them.

"
30 march 2018,sagittarius,"Let others know, without any shadow of a doubt, that you’re not their problem solver. It’s one thing to be of help, but another to get taken advantage of. Besides, some of the people around you need to grow up. That will never happen if you keep riding to the rescue.

"
31 march 2018,sagittarius,"Getting on the same page with people becomes a heck of a lot easier thanks to the full moon in your house of teamwork.

"
3 april 2018,sagittarius,"You’re never one to hold back your opinion, and you generally put all of your cards on the table for the world to see. Not today, archer. Keep your thoughts and plans to yourself. Knowledge is power and you need all the power you can get.

"
4 april 2018,sagittarius,"It’s time to get serious about putting more money in your savings account. Spending cash on entertainment, clothing and electronic toys may be tempting, but the planets urge you to be more conservative. And don’t let anyone guilt you into spending either!

"
5 april 2018,sagittarius,"With lively Mercury in the most fun-loving part of your chart, you may entitled to kick back and have some fun. And so be it! But others may be hell bent on pointing out your responsibilities to you, or want you to play by the rules. Screw it! Do things your way.

"
9 april 2018,sagittarius,"Teamwork may be hard to come by today, and the problem is that you may become overly emotional about it. Take a deep breath, count to ten and wait for Wednesday to arrive, when the cosmic skies are clearer.

"
11 april 2018,sagittarius,"Your sign is optimistic by nature, but sometimes you need to get your feet planted firmly on the ground. If people around you are causing too much drama, or you’re putting them on a pedestal, it’s time to get real. This is especially true within your family or love life. Sometimes “boring” is a good thing.

"
12 april 2018,sagittarius,"Whether you believe in feng shui or not really doesn’t matter. But the planets are  telling you to simplify, simplify, simplify. This is true both at home and at work, so start creating a more organized, streamlined environment at both locations. Then get to work beautifying it, as glam Venus is on the case.

"
13 april 2018,sagittarius,"Ancient astrologers were wise enough to dedicate a house to the subconscious mind and all of the activity that goes on there. Healing Jupiter happens to be in this house for your sign almost all year, and today it sends shimmering beams through the heavens.

Tomorrow’s new moon in this area could bring about a 180 degree turn.

"
16 april 2018,sagittarius,"Your annual new moon in the romance sector occurs today and it’s a honey!

Disciplined Saturn begins to retrograde in your house of income and savings, demanding that you get a clear picture of your cash flow. You can earn more if you’re willing to put in the effort. Fortunately the Sun enters your efficiency zone in a few days, turning you into a dynamo.

"
19 april 2018,sagittarius,"Just how much freedom do you need in your closest relationships, archer? Your sign is famous for being independent but under current cosmic conditions, stability is looking more attractive. There is  a way to balance both; you just have to find it.

"

Pluto, the planet of personal power, begins to retrograde today in your income sector. If you’re not getting paid what you’re worth, or there’s a business idea inside of you that’s dying to come out, start taking action to improve your lot in life.

"
23 april 2018,sagittarius,"Breaking the rules is looking pretty appetizing with a spunky lunar aspect! Of course, this is standard operating procedure for your sign. The good news is that stern, logical Saturn will help you develop some new rules that are well thought out….after you break the others!

"
24 april 2018,sagittarius,"It will pay to be diplomatic over the next few weeks, archer. No matter how badly you may desire to work independently or even pull away from the madding crowd, you still need to act the part of a team player. This will last for about three weeks, so slap a smile on your face and pretend.

"
25 april 2018,sagittarius,"Good luck trying to get your feelings or ideas expressed to people today, be they loved ones or co-workers. People are too wrapped up in their own issues to listen to what you have to say. Sunday and Monday are much better for teamwork and sharing.

It’s time to take charge of your financial destiny and start living the lifestyle of your choosing. But with a full moon coming in your hush-hush zone on Monday, keep your ideas to yourself.

"

"
29 april 2018,sagittarius,"Tomorrow’s full moon occurs in a sector that deals with wellness, surgery, nutrition and any modality required to keep you in tip top shape (such as physical therapy). Today a Sun-Saturn trine makes it easy to create new healthy habits and stick with them. It’s the perfect time to end a habit like smoking, or to begin a diet.

"
30 april 2018,sagittarius,"The full moon in Scorpio is all about closing out iffy, unstable situations and replacing them with solid deals (and people) that you can count on. Respecting yourself and not allowing drama and negativity in your life is a critical part of your journey. Get real and make some serious, life-changing decisions.

"
1 may 2018,sagittarius,"The recent full moon in Scorpio fell in your house of closure, healing and transition. The next two weeks are some of the best in 2018 for releasing things that are no longer helping you on your journey. Naturally, this requires a lot of reflection. But Uranus is howling from your house of having fun, demanding that you just chuck the inner work and party. Ask yourself this: which is most important right now?

"
2 may 2018,sagittarius,"With the Moon in your sign it’s only natural that you’re itching to do your own thing.

"
7 may 2018,sagittarius,"Loved ones could be difficult to read today, or worse–they could be downright cranky!

Don’t give in or give up.

"
8 may 2018,sagittarius,"Snap out of it! The Sun is going to give you a wakeup call if you’re spending too much time in dreamland. Fantasies and unrealistic thinking could take you down the rabbit hole like Alice in Wonderland. Avoid the mushrooms and drink a strong cup of coffee.

"

"
10 may 2018,sagittarius,"Aaawwww!! This is one heck of a sentimental day. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself reminiscing about the past. Or you’re digging through old photos. Why not honor your ancestors and deceased pets by creating a little shrine to them at home?

"
11 may 2018,sagittarius,"Get your affairs in order, archer. The two most authoritative planets in the solar system, Pluto and the Sun, are working overtime in the houses of efficiency and income.

"
12 may 2018,sagittarius,"Unless you’re living in a cloister or monastery, we all want the good things in life.

"

"
16 may 2018,sagittarius,"Uranus moved into your efficiency zone yesterday and things are taking off quickly.

"
21 june 2018,sagittarius,"Money will be on your mind in a big way now that the Sun is in your house of net worth! But don’t get carried away too quickly by jumping into new investments or business deals. Impatient Mars could make you hot to trot, not a good thing if there are contracts that need to be signed.

"
22 june 2018,sagittarius,"Something could happen at work that, if you’re smart and take advantage of it, could end up putting more money in your pocket.

With Pluto in a demanding position, it’s critical that you size up every move you’re going to make….and what other people are doing too. It would also help to say as little as possible.

"
24 june 2018,sagittarius,"It may be difficult to figure out which is more reliable–your intuition or your logical left brain. That’s because they’re both operating equally well, so play it smart….rely on both!

"
25 june 2018,sagittarius,"You may be getting hit with a crisis of confidence today, and this may rattle you a bit. Don’t worry–it’s just a Venus-Jupiter square that’s temporarily throwing you off.

"
26 june 2018,sagittarius,"Your social life may slow down a bit now that Mars is retrograde, but that’s OK–you have some important business to take care of. Thursday’s full moon in your money sector recommends that you spend more time on developing a higher income.

"
27 june 2018,sagittarius,"You don’t want to come off as being too emotional today, but it’s not smart to appear cold or controlled either. Find a happy balance between the two. You’ll be able to do your own thing once Mercury changes signs on Friday.

Go for it.

"
30 june 2018,sagittarius,"Trying to run from problems isn’t going to work, archer. Plunging yourself into work or partying may make you feel as though you don’t have to deal with the issue, but you do. Face it head on and get it over with.

4 july 2018,sagittarius,"You’re in more of a nesting mood these days. Planetary activity in your domestic sector is encouraging you to enjoy good times at home and in the company of loved ones, rather than whooping it up at a bar.

5 july 2018,sagittarius,"Getting in touch with your deepest feelings becomes so much easier with the Sun in an illuminating position. Process those old emotions and dramas; let them go. This won’t happen overnight but it can take far less time than you might expect.

"
6 july 2018,sagittarius,"People may simply not get what you’re all about and what you’re trying to say, archer. Which means that they could come at you verbally or in writing. Don’t sweat it; it’s not your job to explain the world or yourself to lesser minds!

"
8 july 2018,sagittarius,"As Dorothy said in The Wizard of Oz, there’s no place like home. And that rings true today with Neptune being active in your domestic sector. This is a wonderful time to redecorate, remodel or look for new crib. Better yet is that the Sun is in a good place to find you some good deals.

Keep your standards high.

Slow down, find new hacks that will help you, and take your time getting your home and office lives pulled together.

"
9 august 2018,sagittarius,"“Group think” just isn’t going to cut it for you, archer. If people are pushing you to do things their way, think before you dive in. With Saturday’s solar eclipse arriving in the most independent part of your chart, you are going to want to blaze your own path.

This energy occurs again this coming Saturday, so get ready to do some socializing.

"
15 august 2018,sagittarius,"Do an assessment of the people who surround you, archer. There may be people in your circle are primarily concerned with their own agenda. You weren’t put on this planet to be a pawn in someone else’s game. Go on away and leave them behind.

"
16 august 2018,sagittarius,"No matter how much you may want to slack off, it’s time to get caught up with your work! This is true both at home and at the office. Get the grunt work done today, because tomorrow the Moon and Jupiter want you to reward yourself with some pampering and relaxation.

20 august 2018,sagittarius,"This is a big day for making changes to your living situation, archer. Positive changes that will make you feel a lot more content. Maybe you’ll move in with a lover.

"
23 august 2018,sagittarius,"The Sun is now in Virgo, your tenth house of ambition and success. This year will be different from years past in that high octane Mars happens to be in your income sector, pushing you to go after mo’ money. The red planet is retrograde til Monday, so do some homework between now and then.

"
24 august 2018,sagittarius,"Watch out for emotional spending today. Aggressive Mars could be pushing the “spend” button. Likewise, you might be anxious to grab a job offer or start a business. There’s nothing wrong with either option, but wait until Mars goes direct on Monday.

"
25 august 2018,sagittarius,"It’s best to take a conservative approach when it comes to going after your goals.

Well, tonight’s full moon will push you off that fence! With so much planetary activity in your house of stability, you’ll be taking carefully thought out baby steps rather than diving in to the deep end of the pool.

And you may have been questioning your job status as well, thanks to Mars being retrograde in your house of security. Well, the red planet is now direct and things should become clearer.

"
29 august 2018,sagittarius,"Your mind is spilling over with terrific ideas but you run the risk of spreading yourself too thin….and then not completing anything of value. Choose one or two of the most compelling ideas and see them through to completion before starting in on the others.

"
30 august 2018,sagittarius,"Don’t feel badly if you decide to tell people that you’re not going to go along with their latest idea or scheme. Nor do you have to buy the things they like or live your lifestyle like theirs. You’re an individual with your own unique taste and creativity.

Some of this action could go on behind the scenes though, so be aware that some positive hidden forces are at work.

There is a highly practical energy about this, so pay attention to your thoughts and gut hunches.

"
13 september 2018,sagittarius,"You have places to go and people to meet, so why are others being so difficult? Maybe they sense that you have purpose and direction. And maybe they’re little jealous or confused. However, that’s their problem. Keep on doing what you’re doing.

Lucky, abundant Jupiter is working behind the scenes to bring you more money and responsibility. This Wednesday is especially well aspect for making progress, so be prepared!

"
17 september 2018,sagittarius,"Think carefully before you enter into a moneymaking proposition. Mature Saturn is in an analytical position today, anxious to look things over. It’s not that anyone is trying to deceive you. Saturn is the planet of making intelligent long-term decisions, and like a wise old grandfather, he has your back.

"
18 september 2018,sagittarius,"Ouch! Tempers could be frayed at the office, thanks to a Mars-Uranus square. It’s also possible that you may deal with some nasty customer service people who have no interest in serving a customer. You maybe tempted to let them have it, but this is not wise.

This may sound a bit calculated, putting your friends under a microscope and all, but it needs to be done. The cosmos is encouraging you to stick with people who support you 100%. No pretenders need apply. Don’t be afraid to pull away if need be.

"
23 september 2018,sagittarius,"In life there are two kinds of people: anchors and motors. Anchors are the kind of people who hold you back, who keep you in one place. Motors are the type of people who want to zip ahead and have enough a lot of fun. From your chart it appears that you need to cut loose from anchor-type people. Life is way too short!

"
24 september 2018,sagittarius,"It’s make or break time when it comes to romance. Tonight’s full moon occurs in this part of your chart. Should you stay? Should you go? If you’re single, should you take yourself off the market…or dive back into it? Even if you’re happily settled into a romance, you need to get clear about your finances and values. This may take some time but it’s worth it.

"
26 september 2018,sagittarius,"You may not feel like being flamboyant today. Heck, you may just want to blend into the wallpaper! There’s nothing wrong with a little solitude, archer. If you need to pull away and do a little reflecting about life, so be it.

"
28 september 2018,sagittarius,"The right (creative) side of your brain is battling the left (logical) side today.

"
29 september 2018,sagittarius,"If you feel as though people have been trampling all over you, it’s time to put into it. No screaming or yelling will be necessary, however. With logical Saturn at your side, you can set boundaries and set people straight with a quiet kind of authority.

"
30 september 2018,sagittarius,"Who knew that a Sagittarius could be so sentimental? You could be wallowing in nostalgia today, thinking back about the good old days. This is especially true when it comes to your family and friends. There’s nothing wrong with this, by the way. Why not go through old photographs today, or create a little shrine to your ancestors? Many cultures honor their elders this way.

"
1 october 2018,sagittarius,"Keep focused, and keep moving forward. Your emotions could get the better of you today, and you might be thinking about throwing in the towel. Hang in there. Wednesday is a much better day, a time when things will become more clear.

"
2 october 2018,sagittarius,"Trying to get people to cooperate could be next to impossible today, archer. And trying to strong-arm them into doing their jobs will backfire. This energy will proceed for the rest of the week, but once the new moon arrives next Monday, you’re good to go.

"
3 october 2018,sagittarius,"Ggrrrr!!!! Someone’s feeling sexy today. That’s because the vibey Moon is winking at amorous Venus. Go ahead, act on your fantasies and libido. Just get a room.

"
5 october 2018,sagittarius,"You run the risk of letting your fears get the better of you over the next few weeks. Venus is retrograding through the most psychological part of your chart, stirring up your fears, dreams and old dramas.

"
5 april 2018,capricorn,"It’s time for other people to start making some damn sense if you’re going to continue to cooperate with them. Demand answers, Capricorn. If people can’t explain things clearly in a few short sentences, pull away until they figure out how to do that.

What are you waiting for?

"
12 april 2018,capricorn,"This is no time to hold back your feelings, especially with the people (and creatures!) who are closest to you.

This year is all about transitioning into a new lifestyle.

"
21 april 2018,capricorn,"Needy people are going to have to get on line and take a number as far as you’re concerned, Capricorn. And whether you decide to “wait on” them is another issue!

Over the next few months you’re going to plumb the depths of your psyche, goals and image. You’ll figure out where you’re giving your power away and what you need to do to be more calm and centered. It may not always be an easy ride, but the end result will be worth it.

"
23 april 2018,capricorn,"It’s time to get your emotions under control, Capricorn. Yeah, I know, you always keep your cool. The problem is that you tend to keep things bottled up, and then there’s a raging storm going on in your mind. That’s not helpful, especially when it comes to feeling serene and centered.

"
27 april 2018,capricorn,"Your common sense is strong right now, but is that exactly news for a Capricorn? Too bad others can’t seem to operate at the same intelligent level as you. The saying “Why am I always surrounded by idiots?” could be your mantra over the next 24 hours. Why, why, WHY?

"
28 april 2018,capricorn,"You’re no longer a child, so there’s no reason to let someone treat you like one. If anyone around you has a condescending, know-it-all attitude, give ‘em that famous Capricorn cold shoulder. Then keeping marching up to the summit, a place where you belong.

"
29 april 2018,capricorn,"People are pulling upon you, Capricorn, and you may need to take a time out. This is true even of a lover or kids, if you have them. There’s only so much of you to go around.

You’re currently in a strong, creative place too–there will be no shortage of ideas.

"
1 may 2018,capricorn,"Being selective about the people you associate with is critical under current planetary conditions. This isn’t about being a snooty snob, or a brown noser who’s trying to kiss up to VIPs.  Rather, it’s about surrounding yourself with supportive people who add to your life rather than take things away from it, like your peace of mind and joy.

"
2 may 2018,capricorn,"Give ‘em an inch and they’ll take a mile! Yup, it’s one of those days when the nicer and more helpful you are, the more you’ll get dumped on.

"
4 may 2018,capricorn,"Making the most of your talents is what the cosmos is encouraging you to do, Capricorn. If there’s a class that would help you, sign up for it.

"
5 may 2018,capricorn,"Anyone who tries to play you for a fool is making a mistake, Capricorn! You mean business these days and people are crazy if they don’t acknowledge it. There’s no need to rub their noses in it, though. Your confident demeanor speaks for itself.

"

"
7 may 2018,capricorn,"Insecurities could get the better of you today, so try to view everything through a logical lens. People are definitely acting weird but you don’t have to let it throw you off balance. Besides, you have more power and control in your little finger than they have collectively. Remember who’s boss!

"
8 may 2018,capricorn,"It’s your life, Capricorn, and you deserve to live it your way. So don’t let other people tell you what to do. Likewise, stop comparing yourself to your friends or the social media stars who seem to have it all. You’re a unique creature. Break away from the pack.

"
9 may 2018,capricorn,"You tend to be straight forward and tell it like it is, kind of like Spock on Star Trek.  But today it might be fun (and useful!) to add some passion to your words, whether they’re the spoken or written kind. The Moon is in a wonderful spot for letting your words flow with color and pizzazz.

"
10 may 2018,capricorn,"Some creative ideas could pop into your mind today, and if you’re smart you’ll take action on them. Maybe it’s an idea for a book or a blog.

Most Capricorns alive today have never experienced this placement, and it’s well overdue! You need to lighten up, stop and smell the flowers and take in life’s sweeter pleasures. A different kind of lover could come your way between now and 2026. Your talents will skyrocket as you take a chance on doing things that others can’t even imagine. Kudos!

"
16 may 2018,capricorn,"A sparkling new moon occurs in your house of creativity, helping you dig deep into that well of talent you possess.

Inspiration may strike you when you least expect it, so keep a notepad or your cell notepad handy.

"
17 may 2018,capricorn,"Assertive Mars is tearing through your money house which could create a “spend, spend, spend” mentality. It might be coming from someone else, like a kid or a lover who is demanding that you pull out your wallet and buy them things. Don’t go there. You need to start earning and saving more first.

"
18 may 2018,capricorn,"Your ruler, Saturn, is now in your sign and couldn’t be happier. Today the ringed planet forms a fabulous trine with Mercury in your house of creativity, romance and fun.

19 may 2018,capricorn,"You tend to be a lone warrior, even feeling that way in love sometimes. Fortunately cooperative Venus enters your house of partnering, making it easier to gain cooperation from others—which includes lovers! Single sea goats could meet someone quite unexpectedly thanks to wild card Uranus stirring things up.

"
20 may 2018,capricorn,"Your sign is famous for its discipline but over the next four weeks you’re going to be even more regimented than usual. That’s because the Sun enters the most productive part of your chart today. But don’t try to do it all alone! With Venus in your partnership sector you should be reaching out to people who can help you.

"
21 may 2018,capricorn,"Yogis refer to “monkey mind”, that state in which our mind can’t stay focused on one thing and hops around like mad. A strong lunar aspect helps you work on this mental state so that you can chill out and focus like a laser beam.

"
22 may 2018,capricorn,"Try a little tenderness! Verbal Mercury is in a good place today to help you express yourself, especially to people you love. Don’t hold back. Kids, parents, friends, a lover and even your pets should all know just how much you treasure them.

"
24 may 2018,capricorn,"From your chart it looks like you need to cut back on some of your commitments, Capricorn. There are only 24 hours in a day and you can only do so much. Fortunately a beneficial Mars-Sun trine helps you prioritize what’s important—which may include some much needed down time.

"
25 may 2018,capricorn,"You’re so often looked up to as being an expert that it may not occur to you to seek wisdom elsewhere. But you should.

You might become an influencer yourself.

"
26 may 2018,capricorn,"From your chart it appears that although you want to have fun with people, you don’t want to be tied down. This could be on a romantic level but in other relationships as well. Not only that, you need to spend more time with folks who truly know how to live—abundantly, creatively.

"
27 may 2018,capricorn,"There is no place in your life for empty promises and flattery. If someone tries to tempt you with sugar coated words, they’re likely to get a taste of your candid thoughts on the subject. Considering that a full moon arrives on Tuesday in your house of endings, they may even get cut off!

"
28 may 2018,capricorn,"A tense lunar aspect indicates that you should stick to your own views on life rather than relying on the opinions of other people. Tomorrow’s full moon in Sagittarius will help you put an end to circumstances in your life that are outdated or toxic, and you need to have clarity to do so. Your own wisdom should work just fine.

"
29 may 2018,capricorn,"Out with the old, in with the new! No, it’s not New Year’s Eve.

Fortunately wise Mercury enters your house of habits too, making it easier to stick to your decisions.

"
30 may 2018,capricorn,"Your intuition is in overdrive today, but that doesn’t mean that it’s accurate! People may be gossiping or making remarks that have no substance behind them.

"
31 may 2018,capricorn,"A new kind of determination is building inside of you, a kind that you may not have experienced before. You’re starting to understand that there is a different way of viewing life, one that involves simplifying things enormously. It’s a Zen kind of a vibe.

"
4 june 2018,capricorn,"There may be only one sensible person in the room these days, Capricorn, and what a surprise….it’s you! Sure, you may be saying to yourself, my sign is the most rational one of the twelve. But it’s really due to a no-nonsense Sun-Mercury aspect going on in the heavens right now. Just keep plugging away and ignore the crazy rants of others.

"
5 june 2018,capricorn,"You’re in no mood today to tolerate fools who have no clue what’s going on. Nor should you! But is it really necessary to get into a debate with them about their stupidity? Don’t waste your precious time.

"
6 june 2018,capricorn,"Conforming to traditions is a stereotype for your sign, but people don’t really know that you’re quite capable of blazing your own trail.

"
7 june 2018,capricorn,"Teamwork could be hard to come by today, so don’t expect others to do their fair share. It’s possible that they are simply confused about their role or the tasks in front of them. If that’s the case, you may need to be the person who straighten things out for them. Otherwise, they’re slacking!

"
8 june 2018,capricorn,"The weekend’s planetary energy is just right for relaxing at home. That is, of course, if your home is a happy one! Parents or siblings could get on your nerves, even if they’re not living under your roof. Turn off your phone and don’t check your e-mails.

"
10 june 2018,capricorn,"Some new people could be entering your life over the next few weeks, people whom you’d actually want  to team up with!

"
11 june 2018,capricorn,"You’re sure of yourself, especially your values, and no one will be able to make you see differently. But that doesn’t mean that others won’t try! Just ignore them and move on. You’re on the right track.

"
14 june 2018,capricorn,"You usually keep your cool but a tense Venus-Uranus aspect could cook your last nerve. An emotional outburst may result, and hopefully not at your end.

"
23 june 2018,capricorn,"Is it time for a personal makeover, Capricorn? Why not? It seems as though you have some outdated opinions of yourself. It’s time to see yourself in a brand new light, without giving a care to what anyone else thinks of you.

"
24 august 2018,capricorn,"The Navy SEALs training is considered to be the toughest regimen on earth. Very few make it through. They call it “the crucible”: a place where you get ground down emotionally until you emerge victorious, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

"
25 august 2018,capricorn,"Your sign is famous for being on the traditional, conservative side, but right now you’re willing to push past that stereotype. You’re in a highly creative, free-thinking mood, and the best part is that some of your more outre ideas could actually go somewhere.

"
4 september 2018,capricorn,"You’re ruler, Saturn, is retrograde in your sign. This means you’re probably rethinking all sorts of things, including your closest relationships. If anyone in your world creating too much drama, chances are you’re going to set them straight—or cut them loose.

"
5 september 2018,capricorn,"Feeling the urge to learn more? It could happen now that mental Mercury is in your house of mind expansion. You might go back to college and get another degree. Or perhaps you’ll take a class that will help you get a license for your trade. Maybe you’ll just take a class for the heck of it, like art or a foreign language. This energy continues for most of the month, so take it seriously.

"
6 september 2018,capricorn,"Have you been feeling a little bit off? If so, you can blame it on Saturn which has been retrograde in your sign for several months.

"
15 september 2018,capricorn,"Did you ever watch Star Trek? Remember that line, “to boldly go where no man has gone before”? That’s kind of the position that you’re in right now.

"
16 september 2018,capricorn,"You’ve got the big picture in mind, and this is a good thing. You are usually so focused and determined that you can forget to see the overall scheme of things. More adventurous options are available to you; keep your eyes open for them.

Follow the path that allows you to be authentic.

"
25 september 2018,capricorn,"Right now I’m reading a book by a former Navy SEAL. These guys were taught how to focus like a laser beam on whatever challenge they had ahead of them.

"
28 september 2018,capricorn,"Playing it too safe? From your chart it looks like you could add some spice to your life. This isn’t so much about your career as it is your appearance. Or your hobbies.

"
29 september 2018,capricorn,"It’s time to shore up your health, Capricorn. You’ve been pushing yourself very hard and your vitality may be low.

12 october 2018,capricorn,"Slap a smile on your face and act like a team player, Capricorn. If you try to go up against the system or authority figures it will work against you. Besides, you’re on the right track with your life. And you’ll end up having the last laugh as a result.

"
13 october 2018,capricorn,"It seems like your mind could benefit from a good cobweb sweeping. Seriously, you’ve got to get the mental kaka out of the way. Study mindfulness. Journal.

"
16 october 2018,capricorn,"Start doing a better job of looking out for yourself, Capricorn. This isn’t about being selfish. It’s about protecting yourself from the daily onslaught of deadlines and crazy people and BS. If you don’t start pulling away, you’ll become so spent that there will be nothing left.

"
17 october 2018,capricorn,"You need to develop some stronger foundations in your life, Capricorn. Flying by the seat of your pants just isn’t going to cut it any longer. Do what you have to do to pull it together. This may mean changing some major parts of your life, but if you don’t, you’ll just keep dealing with the same old garbage.

"
18 october 2018,capricorn,"Selling your soul to make a buck? If that’s the case you need a wakeup call. Take a good long look at your values. Do they match up with what you’re doing for a living? You CAN make money and be authentic too.

"
19 october 2018,capricorn,"Things need to be kept fluid or flexible when it comes to group activities. This is true at the office, with your friends and other teams you may be part of, such as volunteer organizations. Creative Neptune is inspiring you to brainstorm and strategize. But leave role assignment and budgeting to another date.

"
20 october 2018,capricorn,"You’re known for being a straight talker, but this weekend you might want to try a little charm instead. Watery Neptune is in your communicating sector, suggesting a softer touch. Of course, you could use this energy to spout out pure BS. But why bother? You’re not desperate!

"
21 october 2018,capricorn,"Your confidence speaks for itself. You know that you’re on the right path, but you could also inspire others. So if a friend or a team could use the boost, don’t hold back. Share your wisdom, honesty and enthusiasm.

"
22 october 2018,capricorn,"Keep personal information just that: personal. The Sun is getting ready to enter one of the most social parts of your chart, but that doesn’t mean that everyone you meet needs to get the 411. Choose your confidantes carefully.

"
23 october 2018,capricorn,"Teamwork and technology are both highlighted now that the Sun is in your house of networking. Over the next four weeks you can benefit enormously by spending time with the tribe, as well as movers and shakers in your industry. Tech ventures are also well aspected, so update your systems and crush it on social media.

"
24 october 2018,capricorn,"A sizzling chapter in love can open up–or come to a close! With the full moon in your house of romance, many sea goats will find new love or seal the deal with an existing lover. I have to say, if you don’t share the same dreams and values with your amour, there could be tension. But it can be worked out.

"
25 october 2018,capricorn,"You’re in desperate need of having some fun, which does NOT include watching Netflix. With the Moon in the most artistic and cultured part of your chart you should plan museum visits, go to concerts or take in a play. Why not make this a regular habit?

"
26 october 2018,capricorn,"The next few days are awesome for hanging out with friends and making new connections, whether they’re in your personal or professional life.

"
27 october 2018,capricorn,"You know what you want. You have a plan. So what’s holding you back? Even the fearless goat can be unsure from time to time about where they’re heading. If you need advice, seek it. Mentors are out there waiting to provide you with the guidance you need.

"
28 october 2018,capricorn,"There are only so many hours in a day, and from your chart, it appears that you’ve been burning the candle at both ends. Take some time to relax today, especially with friends. The entire week ahead is wonderful for getting together with existing friends and people you don’t even know yet!

"
30 october 2018,capricorn,"Over the next few days you may feel as though you have one nerve left and everyone is working it! Seriously, why do people have to be so annoying? Pull away from them if you need to. You simply can’t afford to deal with the negativity right now.

"
31 october 2018,capricorn,"Sshhhh!!!! It’s time to go undercover. Now that shrewd Mercury is in the most secretive part of your chart, you can do your best work alone. Maybe you need to get rid of some bad habits. Or maybe you’re planning on moving on from an unhappy relationship. Perhaps it’s time to leave a soul sucking job. Do you have to do, and do it quietly.

"
1 november 2018,capricorn,"You don’t have to play by other peoples’ rules, Capricorn. So if anyone tries to coerce you into doing things their way, forget it. While you’re at it, why don’t you buck the system too!

"
2 november 2018,capricorn,"Keep your on the big picture, Capricorn. Right now you run the risk of focusing on things that aren’t important in the grand scheme of life. The little stuff is never going to go away, so why bother even thinking about it?

"
5 november 2018,capricorn,"You need to be around people who inspire you, Capricorn. This doesn’t mean that you have to dump your existing circle of friends and colleagues.

"
6 november 2018,capricorn,"You are on the verge of entering one of the most cathartic periods of your entire life.

"
7 november 2018,capricorn,"Making an impact on the world becomes a heck of a lot easier thanks to today’s new Moon in your house of networking. Between now and May you can make new friends, find a mentor or crush it on social media. This house also governs technology, so if you are tech dependent this is a wonderful aspect.

"
8 november 2018,capricorn,"The saying “out with the old, in with the new” is usually reserved for New Year’s Eve. But Jupiter’s move into your house of closure and transition marks a life turning point. Over the next year, you can do some much-needed inner work. Healing your body and your mind are quite possible. Keep things on the down low. Research your options and make plans to move onto a much higher level of existence.

"
9 november 2018,capricorn,"There’s nothing wrong with looking out for yourself, Capricorn. But this isn’t about being selfish. With Mars and Venus in the most ambitious parts of your chart, you really do need to look out for number one these days. Things that you set in motion right now can stand the test of time.

"
10 november 2018,capricorn,"You’re so used to being in control of your thoughts and your emotions. This is admirable, but sometimes you can lose sight as to what’s really going on around you. Don’t assume that you got everything figured out. Open up your eyes to some new possibilities.

"
12 november 2018,capricorn,"Now that Jupiter is in the most psychological part of your chart, you should be clearing out mental junk from your mind.

"
13 november 2018,capricorn,"Your attitude is improving, especially when it comes to situations that have been dragging you down.

"
15 november 2018,capricorn,"Watch what you say! Mega mouth Mars is now in your house of communication. The problem is that Mercury retrogrades tomorrow in your house of confidentiality, which could throw off your judgment. If in doubt, and don’t say it…and don’t write it.

"
16 november 2018,capricorn,"You’re in an interesting spot, Capricorn. Mercury is now spinning backward in your house of confidentiality. You really need to keep a lid on things. But aggressive Mars is now in your house of communicating too! As a result, you’re going to have to choose your message very carefully. Just say the bare minimum over the next three weeks.

"
17 november 2018,capricorn,"Important goals may have been held up over the past few weeks, but now momentum starts to build. You’re in a wonderful position to start making things happen. But you may need to narrow down your options. Don’t go chasing after every shiny new thing that catches your attention.

"
18 november 2018,capricorn,"You are such a sturdy soul, so full of confidence, that you often don’t bother to protect your own back. But you can’t afford to do that right now. Not everyone shares your high set of values and morals. Keep an eye out for bottom feeders!

"
19 november 2018,capricorn,"Resentment could be bubbling not too far below the surface, either on your part or the part of someone else. If you are the one dealing with this, the smartest thing that you can do is to find a safe way to release your frustration. Don’t let anything fester inside your mind or heart.

"
21 november 2018,capricorn,"You know what needs to be done, so get on with it already. You know that you’re going to face roadblocks. Naturally you have fears or concerns. But nothing is going to stop you, and that knowledge should be enough.

"
22 november 2018,capricorn,"On the outside, you may appear friendly and charming. But on the inside, there’s a lot going on in the brain of yours. The Sun is now in Sagittarius, the most psychological part of your chart. Over the next four weeks you’ll be processing a lot of stuff from your past, stuff that needs to go bye-bye.

"
23 november 2018,capricorn,"From your chart it appears that your mental health could use a strong “vitamin shot”! Make sure that you get some R and R this weekend. Sit down with a good book and a cup of tea. Or book a massage at the spa. Pull away from the insane Black Friday crowds, please, I beg of you!

"
24 november 2018,capricorn,"Your brain has been going all over the place lately, with fears and dramas and negative emotions tearing through it. Fortunately Neptune goes direct in your house of thinking, easing up some of this storminess. Next week promises to be one of the most cathartic times you’ve ever had. Get ready for transformation.

"
25 november 2018,capricorn,"You are ready to do things that are out of the ordinary. Kudos! But not everyone in your world will agree with or support your plans. Screw ’em. Surge forward. If you have to keep things to yourself, so be it.

"
26 november 2018,capricorn,"Today may be the best time in your entire life to let things go. This may sound like a bold statement. But the Sun and Jupiter are forming a conjunction in your house of closure and transition, the best possible aspect in astrology. Seriously, it’s time. Do the inner work necessary. Mars is a wonky angle, though, so don’t tell everyone what you’re up to.

"
27 november 2018,capricorn,"You are going through a period of extreme mental cleansing. Yesterday’s Jupiter-Sun aspect was designed to help you close out the past and things that aren’t working. Today intelligent Mercury gets into the act, bringing things in to clear focus. Confusion begone.

"
28 november 2018,capricorn,"You have a lot of planetary action going on in your house of secrecy, which means that you should be keeping most things below the radar. But today there is an exception. A strong Saturn-Mars aspect encourages you to get things out into the open, either verbally or in writing. Just be highly selective about what it is that you reveal.

"
29 november 2018,capricorn,"Been thinking about starting a home based business or a side hustle? A Moon-Uranus trine makes now the perfect time to do so. Be aware that this “little business idea” of yours could turn into something big, really big. But Steve Jobs got started in his garage, and we all know how that story goes!

"
30 november 2018,capricorn,"If your life has been out of balance in any way, you’ll certainly feel it today. The cosmos will deliver a wakeup call. It shouldn’t be anything real serious, but enough to make you realize that you need some down time.

"
1 december 2018,capricorn,"We’re all known by the company we keep, and in the upcoming week you should be paying attention to the people in your world. Mercury retrogrades into your house of friends and networking, placing close ties under a microscope. If you have any doubts about a friendship or a group you’re associated with, then you may end up making a decision about them by the 6th.

"
3 december 2018,capricorn,"Don’t be a stranger, Capricorn! From your chart it appears that you may have pulled away from people little bit. But with magnetic Venus in your house of networking and friendship, you should be out there mingling more. Besides, you never know who you might meet.

"
5 december 2018,capricorn,"If something seems off, it probably is. Your intuition is running high these days, but don’t be too quick to act on it. You need more intel, which will only come over time. Patience.

"
7 december 2018,capricorn,"A highly cathartic new moon is taking place today, and if you’re wise you’ll take advantage of its healing energy. It’s perfect for releasing baggage that has been holding you back. Over the next six months you can make lots of progress, provided you’re willing to do the inner work.

"
8 december 2018,capricorn,"Use this weekend to recharge your batteries, Capricorn. From your chart it appears that you’ve been doing way too much thinking, talking and working. Did you know that your brain uses more of your energy than any other part of your body? It does, and you need to chill out for a little while.

"
9 december 2018,capricorn,"It’s a good day to confide in a trusted friend. Likewise, if you need a mentor, one should be right around the corner. This includes someone you could find on the Internet, a person with smarts who has a podcast or blog that can help you.

"
10 december 2018,capricorn,"Things that have bothered you a lot in the past are going to start to fade away. It’s not that they’re going to disappear. Rather, you’re developing a brand-new viewpoint. Peace of mind is a beautiful thing!

"
11 december 2018,capricorn,"You need to strike a good balance between your personal down time and the time you spend with friends. Sure, you can have fun with the tribe, but it’s also wise to tuck yourself away fro some quiet time. Once Mercury changes signs tomorrow, you’re going to crave more peaceful moments.

"
12 december 2018,capricorn,"From your chart it looks like you have a lot of things to sort out. Fortunately clever Mercury glides into the most secretive, psychological part of your chart. Don’t explain anything to anyone; just work things out in your head behind the scenes.

"
13 december 2018,capricorn,"Keep things to yourself, no matter how much you’re dying to talk. Yes, you’re under a lot of pressure but you can’t trust everyone, sad to say. Learn new ways to cope with the stress. Mindfulness, journaling, aerobic workouts–do whatever it takes.

"
14 december 2018,capricorn,"You need to make changes in the way you think, Capricorn. “Bullsh**”, I can hear you saying. “I’m the most mature and hardest working sign of the zodiac.”  True…..but that doesn’t mean that your thought processes are perfect. It’s time for some inner work. The faster you accept that the better off you’ll be.

"
15 december 2018,capricorn,"Neurologists have discovered that the human brain is “plastic”, meaning that we’re not stuck dealing with rigid old behaviors and thought patterns. The brain can be reprogrammed with practice. A powerful lunar aspect enables you to start positive reprogramming now. Consider meditation as a good place to start.

"
16 december 2018,capricorn,"Your official birthday season starts this coming Friday, but today you get a jumpstart. That’s because Venus and Saturn are forming an auspicious aspect in the heavens. It’s time to consider your values, and the kinds of things you’d like to manifest in the year ahead. Tomorrow is a good day to seek advice from other people. You won’t be traveling down this path alone.

"
17 december 2018,capricorn,"Feeling feistier? As though you’re coming out of a slumber and you’re ready to tackle the world again? True, the Sun is getting ready to glide into your sign on Friday. But today subterranean Pluto is active, high fiving motivator Mars across the heavens. It;s time to start kicking butt and feeling like your old indomitable self again.

"
18 december 2018,capricorn,"You don’t have to put up with bad behavior from others, Capricorn. Enough is enough. But with planets gliding through the most hush-hush part of your chart, you don’t need to make a big production of this. Sometimes giving people the silent treatment–or subtly pulling away–is a smarter move than getting in their faces.

"
19 december 2018,capricorn,"You’re starting to realize that some big changes need to be made, and they need to happen NOW. Which is perfect timing, considering that your birthday season begins on Friday. That’s your New Year’s Day, so get ready for it.

"
21 december 2018,capricorn,"Yay!! The Sun is now in your sign, crowning you the celestial favorite for the next four weeks. But chances are that you won’t be in showy mood, trying to impress others. Right now you’re in secret agent mode, doing things behind the scenes….and waiting for the big, stunning reveal.

"
22 december 2018,capricorn,"Just how, exactly, do other people fit into your life right now? That’s the question raised behind tonight’s full moon in your partnership sector. Yesterday the Sun entered Capricorn, placing your needs and wants on center stage. So if anyone is trying to pull you away from who you are or what you want to achieve, it may be time to set some boundaries.

"
23 december 2018,capricorn,"You manage to accomplish more in one day than most people can do in a week. But that doesn’t mean that you should! Slow down a little bit and take it easy. You need to recharge the batteries before you burn out.

"
24 december 2018,capricorn,"You may be confused about which way to go in a certain situation. From your chart it appears that your brain is a little cooked! No wonder you’re a bit mixed up. You need to some down time to let your mind and soul truly relax. Stop pushing yourself so hard.

"
28 december 2018,capricorn,"It appears that you have some very lofty ambitions for 2019. Chances are you’ll succeed, too! But the smartest way to go is to pick the brains of movers and shakers.

"
29 december 2018,capricorn,"You are a unique individual, and your opinion counts. So stop trying to fit in with the rest of the crowd! As a matter of fact, if you’ve been thinking about presenting a brand-new self image to the world, now is the time. You don’t need to stay stuck in the past.

"
30 december 2018,capricorn,"Do something different today, something that pushes you past previous boundaries. We all have comfort zones that keep us in check. The cosmos is encouraging you to take just a teeny little baby step, if that’s what makes you feel comfortable.

"
31 december 2018,capricorn,"This hasn’t been an easy year for you and I’m sure you ready to see it go. Now that Mars is in your house of domestic matters, it’s time to clear out issues dealing with your family or residence. Actually, 2019 is going to be a big year for clearing out the past. Might as well start here first.

"
28 january 2018,aquarius,"
Anxiety may be building, and you are in the mood to vent. But be careful what you say and to whom. You run the risk of alienating people who are decision makers, or whose favor you need. Tomorrow is a much better time to express yourself.

"
8 march 2018,aquarius,"Slow down there Aquarius! Are you on the right path, be it in your career or love life? Heck….is there any path at all? If you’re just drifting, or you’re not living an authentic life, you’ll have the next four months to figure things out. That’s because Jupiter goes retrograde today in your house of ambition and success. Take your time and make smart changes.

"
9 march 2018,aquarius,"Tread carefully with friends and team members today, Aquarius. A Moon-Mars meeting could provoke you to lash out at a slacker colleague or a person whom you suspect to be a frenemy. On the flip side, you could also have a blast partying with the tribe and meeting new people. Mars is a double edged sword; handle with care.

"
10 march 2018,aquarius,"Your intuition could be off today, so think before you speak or act. From your chart it appears that you need more intel. The entire second half of March is a great time to do some snooping and digging.

"
11 march 2018,aquarius,"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer! That old saying rings true today and Tuesday, Aquarius. If you need to schmooze someone whom you don’t trust, do so with the knowledge that you’re protecting your backside.

"
12 march 2018,aquarius,"The next few days are auspicious for creating new routines that will add to your feeling of serenity. Maybe it’s mindfulness meditation or taking a daily walk in nature.

"
13 march 2018,aquarius,"Your sign isn’t known for being woo-woo, that’s for sure. And with logical Saturn in the house of your subconscious mind, your intuition is as sharp as a surgeon’s scalpel.

"
14 march 2018,aquarius,"Your optimism may be dimmed today as you wonder if you really have what it takes to do something important.

But current planetary aspects promise that if you put in the legwork and follow solid routines, that you’ll start seeing results over the next six months.

"
16 march 2018,aquarius,"Solid and stable doesn’t mean boring. A sweet Moon-Neptune aspect could make your love life sizzle yet maintain security. Singles who are looking, remember that the “quiet ones” are often tigers. Just sayin’.

"
17 march 2018,aquarius,"A sparkling new moon in your income sector opens up a six month period in which you can find a new gig, score a raise or beef up revenues. If you’re thinking about starting a business or changing jobs, you might want to keep it on the downlow though.

"
19 march 2018,aquarius,"“Where is this relationship going?” If you’re in need of having that kind of conversation, today’s a good day to have one.

"
20 march 2018,aquarius,"Loose lips sink ships, Aquarius! The mighty Sun is now in your house of communicating, which should  be a good thing. But Mercury goes retrograde here on Thursday. The bottom line? If you have something to say, present, negotiate or write, do it before Thursday. After that, work on revisions.

"
21 march 2018,aquarius,"The full moon on the 31st could bring something wonderful to a happy conclusion. But before you pop open that champagne bottle, make sure that all of the finer details have been taken care of. Keep your mouth shut too: planets in your house of confidentiality are warning you against saying too much too soon.

"
22 march 2018,aquarius,"Ok, it’s here–Mercury is retrograde in your communicating sector! Needless to say, you have to watch your words, whether they’re written or spoken. People may be hard to read (or trust) so take your time and let them show their hand.

"
23 march 2018,aquarius,"Expressing yourself well may be a struggle over the next few days. Pluto and Mars are active in the house of your subconscious mind, trying to help you release your emotions and thoughts. But finding the words may be difficult. Don’t worry—they’ll come, but not until around the 31st.

"

"
27 march 2018,aquarius,"It’s time to be open with the people closest to you and let them know how you feel. Suffering in silence for eons never did any good for anyone. Sure, sometimes you need to be discreet, but don’t let others think that they have to be mind readers to understand you.

"
28 march 2018,aquarius,"You could blurt your feelings out today, but is that such a bad thing? Tell someone that you love them. Call a friend and have a joint bitch session. Start journaling or blogging. Write that book that’s been in your mind for years.

"
29 march 2018,aquarius,"Read between the lines, Aquarius. Things won’t be obvious. People could be holding back. Circumstances could be fuzzy. Take your time and use your gut.

1 april 2018,aquarius,"Making connections is what it’s all about over the next 48 hours! Reach out to mentors, make new friends or flirt with that hot thang you’ve been lusting after. Chatty Mercury is in an awesome spot to show you off in only the best light.

"
2 april 2018,aquarius,"You may be anxious to put an end to things that are annoying or troubling you, but don’t be too hasty. Your decisions will carry way into the future and it’s imperative that you are using logic as well as your intuition.

"
3 april 2018,aquarius,"Support may come from people you wouldn’t expect, Aquarius. It seems that you’ve managed to impress others and now they’ll out in a good word for you. Hard work and character can really pay off.

"
4 april 2018,aquarius,"No matter how polite or sensible you may be, you can’t count on others to be the same way! Resistance could be strong today but it could be the hidden kind. Steer clear of known malcontents and those whom you suspect to be closet trolls.

"
5 april 2018,aquarius,"Your inner “self talk” appears to need an upgrade. It’s time to quit blaming, fretting and obsessing. Furthermore, you need to shut that brain of yours down  and give it a rest! Why not start a meditating, journaling or mindfulness practice?

"
6 april 2018,aquarius,"Getting along better with family members is in the stars! No one can push our buttons better or faster than family, but these days progress can be made. It will require teamwork, but that’s better than trying to do everything on your own.

"
7 april 2018,aquarius,"It’s Saturday and you may usually go out on the town, but today’s cosmic activity suggests a quiet night at home! Canoodle with your honey behind closed doors. Or if there’s no honey in sight, pamper yourself instead. A spa visit may be in order too.

"
9 april 2018,aquarius,"Mercury is retrograde in your third house of thinking, strategizing and expression, so your opinions could be changing frequently. There’s nothing wrong with that as it will help you sort out your thoughts. Clarity returns around the 15th and 16th, so keep on pondering til then.

"
10 april 2018,aquarius,"It’s a waste of time to get others to do things your way, especially when they feel entitled to their behavior. You’re better off doing things your own way for now. Once Mercury goes direct on the 15th you’ll be able to communicate with them more directly.

"
11 april 2018,aquarius,"Feeling comfortable in your closest relationships is what it’s all about today. After all, if you’re not at ease within your friendships, love life or family situation, how happy can you be? A wonderful Venus-Mars trine helps you work things out and create deeper bonds.

"
12 april 2018,aquarius,"Your sign is famous for its outgoing, independent attitude but right now you may be craving warm and fuzzy moments at home. The next few days are well aspected for relaxing chez vous  rather than partying on the town. So start baking some mac and cheese, get a hot cup of tea and turn on Netflix.

"
13 april 2018,aquarius,"It may seem that others have the upper hand in career and other matters, but this is a temporary situation. Keep calm and carry on. Your perseverance will be noted and rewarded in the not so distant future.

"
14 april 2018,aquarius,"What a day for a daydream! Misty Neptune is swirling up activity in your subconscious mind, and the best part is that these daydreams could actually become reality. All the more reason to pay close attention to them, and the kinds of visions you have while you sleep too.

"
15 april 2018,aquarius,"OK, the coast is clear. You can now open your mouth and say what you want. Well, maybe not everything! Mercury goes direct today in your house of communicating. And tomorrow a new moon takes place in this sector, enabling you to go loud and proud with whatever message you want to get out there.

"
16 april 2018,aquarius,"There’s a new moon today in your house of thinking and self-expression which could encourage you to speak up and get your name and ideas out there. But Saturn and Pluto will retrograde next week in your house of secrecy, indicating that you need to only reveal what’s necessary.

"
17 april 2018,aquarius,"You’re entering a thoughtful time, a period in which you may change your mind about many things. Saturn begins a months long retrograde in the house of the subconscious mind, urging you to do a mental detox! Pluto will retrograde here too within a few days time, exposing all of the times and places where you’re giving away your power.

"
18 april 2018,aquarius,"Seems like everyone wants their ideas and image to go viral these days, but how many people actually succeed? You’re the most likely sign to be seen and heard thanks to a dazzling Sun-Uranus meet up today in your house of communication. Work it!

"
19 april 2018,aquarius,"With so much planetary activity going on in the most emotional and mental part of your chart, you may be feeling more cautious than usual. This is actually a good place to be, as you won’t be likely to make mistakes by jumping in to things too quickly. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have any fun either!

"
20 april 2018,aquarius,"Domestic and family matters come to the fore now that the Sun is in Taurus. Your relationships with your kids, lover and parents may need be revised. Creating a beautiful, comfortable home is also important, whether you’re single or attached. Living in a serene environment—and carrying that peace of mind with you all day—is the goal!

"
21 april 2018,aquarius,"Old habits are hard to break, but break them you must. Wise Saturn is now retrograde in your house of mental health and routines, and Pluto begins to spin backward there tomorrow. Be honest with yourself, dig deep and determine what needs to be changed.

"
22 april 2018,aquarius,"It’s time to purge your psyche of toxic trash, Aquarius. Subterranean Pluto has gone retrograde in your house of dramas, emotions and the past. The next few months could be revolutionary, changing your life and attitude in ways that you simply can’t imagine right now. Seek help if you need it or do your own inner work.

"
23 april 2018,aquarius,"There’s an awful lot of energy right now asking you to focus on your goals, which is a good thing as you may need to readjust your vision. And lucky you, the Moon is in the most creative part of your chart! So take some time to think outside the box. How can you add more pizzazz to your life while you go after your heart’s desire?

"
24 april 2018,aquarius,"Lucky Aquarius! Amorous Venus enters your house of romance today, setting up a three week period in which you could enjoy the attention of a lover (and that includes a new flame!). With next week’s full moon occurring in your house of goals, chances are you’ll be thinking long term when it comes to love.

"
25 april 2018,aquarius,"Keep your mouth shut and just plow ahead today, Aquarius. Stern Saturn in your house of confidentiality recommends the silent treatment. Anything you say could be used against you later on, so don’t give the trolls and naysayers any ammunition.

"
26 april 2018,aquarius,"Sshhh!!! A top secret meeting of Mars and Pluto turns you into either super spy James Bond, psychic John Edward or the Wizard of Oz (“pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!”). Seriously, your ability to get things done behind the scenes is unparalleled today. Dig deep. Solve mysteries. Uncover amazing solutions. Use your imagination, wisdom and intuition.

"
27 april 2018,aquarius,"You’re saying the right things, but do you have the right audience? Make sure that you’re not wasting your time talking to people who aren’t going to get it. This is just as true in your personal life as it is in your professional one. Either hone your message or find a different crowd.

"
28 april 2018,aquarius,"Pushing past our own personal boundaries can be scary sometimes. Fear sets in, along with worries about what will happen next. Will we succeed? Are loved ones going to support us in our quest? Those kinds of thoughts may go through your head today. Fortunately the full moon on Monday will make them go bye-bye.

"
29 april 2018,aquarius,"It’s time to make some major decisions about the direction your life is heading in, Aquarius. Tomorrow’s full moon demands it! Today you might find yourself in quite a reflective mood, assessing what should stay and what needs to go. Your serenity depends upon it.

"
30 april 2018,aquarius,"The annual full moon in your ambition and success sector is a winner! If you’re looking to make more money, know that inspirational Neptune is in a terrific angle to the moon. So is Mars, and they’re both in houses that govern intuition and logical thought too. Use your gut to come up with ideas for scoring more dinero.

"
1 may 2018,aquarius,"The full moon yesterday set up a two-week period in which you can make amazing progress toward all of your major goals. The problem is that your thinking may not be clear due to wonky Uranus acting up in your house of mental activity. You also run the risk of blurting out your ideas to people who shouldn’t know about them. Slow down….and shut up!

"
2 may 2018,aquarius,"You may decide to keep people at arm’s length today as petty behavior could erupt among friends or lovers. Likewise, you need to make sure that you’re not acting snarky or jealous. Tomorrow is a smart time to study your thoughts and ask yourself if you’re being the best person you can be. Also, are your friends true blue?

"
3 may 2018,aquarius,"Your dream state could be especially active these days so pay close attention to what flows in! Once red hots Mars moves into your sign on the 16th you can start acting on gut hunches.

"
4 may 2018,aquarius,"It’s a great day for balancing both the right and left side of your brain. Logic and emotions can work hand in hand instead of doing battle, so take this positive energy and run with it.

"
5 may 2018,aquarius,"There will be a lot of activity going on in your subconscious mind this weekend. Don’t be surprised if your dream state becomes more active, or gut hunches keep popping up. Pay attention to these valuable nuggets of wisdom.

"
6 may 2018,aquarius,"Who says that stability can’t be sexy? It can be, thanks to a yummy Sun-Neptune connection. Torrid romances might make for great books and movies, but not so much in real life.

"
7 may 2018,aquarius,"It will be easy to get swept away today….too  easy. Murky Neptune and Venus are stuck in a fantasy-fueled opium den of delusion. Therefore, don’t kid yourself about anyone or anything. Clarity should return by Friday.

"
8 may 2018,aquarius,"From your chart it appears that you desperately need some “me” time. Family members, pets and lovers may also be crying out for more attention. The problem is that your job responsibilities or other worries may be wearing you down….all the more reason to take good care of yourself and the ones you love.

"
9 may 2018,aquarius,"Get out of my way! Your determination rises thanks to a potent Moon-Saturn aspect. Other people may not notice your new attitude at first, but that’s OK. They’ll figure it out soon enough.

"
10 may 2018,aquarius,"Keep your wits about you where money is concerned. It’s not that smarmy snake oil salesmen are going to try to rip you off. It’s more like unrealistic thinking on your part about where money is going to come from or how expensive things will be. Tomorrow is a better day for budgeting.

"
11 may 2018,aquarius,"Feeling emo? It’s not surprising considering that the Sun and Pluto are active in the most personal, stability-centered parts of your chart. But don’t feel guilty about sharing what’s going on in your heart and your mind. This is one of the best days all year to open up.

"
12 may 2018,aquarius,"Your intuition could be way off base today, so don’t say or do anything based on what your gut is telling you. Likewise your mind could be dreaming up worst case scenarios that have nothing to do with reality. Keep it real.

"
13 may 2018,aquarius,"Get on top of family squabbles and housing matters over the next three weeks. Practical, smooth-talking Mercury is now in your domestic sector, and there will be a new moon here on Tuesday as well. You may have to get a little pushy but do what it takes to straighten things out.

"
14 may 2018,aquarius,"The sudden desire to expand your mind could hit you out of the blue today, Aquarius. This could involve signing up for a class, studying a new philosophy or networking with people who have a bigger view of the world. It’s all good, and you may be surprised at what you discover.

"
15 may 2018,aquarius,"Home is where the heart is, and over the next eight years your domestic life will get a complete makeover. Uranus, planet of rapid change, is now in your home and family sector until 2026. Relocating, having kids, helping your parents, buying your first place, developing greater inward contentment—all of these are possible.

"
16 may 2018,aquarius,"Feeling comfortable in your own skin is what it’s all about, thanks to Uranus entering your house of family, home and security. A new moon has just taken place here too, opening up a six month period in which you’re going to demand more quality time with the ones you love. Career matters will just have to wait. While you’re at it, make sure to devote some much needed time and attention to your own self care.

"
17 may 2018,aquarius,"Mars is in your house, making you feisty as all get out. And you won’t take kindly to anyone who gets in your face and tries to push their agenda. A Mars-Uranus square could make this happen, so keep your cool. The weekend is a good time to set boundaries, which may simply mean quietly pulling away from malcontents.

"
18 may 2018,aquarius,"Your ability to find serenity and contentment skyrockets with an amazing Mercury-Saturn trine—no woo-woo stuff involved! Nope, this is all about being logical and real. Calmly figure out what’s throwing you off balance and resolve to fix it.

"
19 may 2018,aquarius,"Teamwork will count for a lot over the next few weeks, now that diplomatic Venus is in your house of getting things done. Stop being the go-to person. Quit thinking that you’re the only one who’s smart enough to do the task. You might be, but isn’t it getting tiresome to be the dependable one?

"
20 may 2018,aquarius,"In the mood for love? You should be now that the Sun is in your house of romance. But you won’t be in an airy-fairy place. On the contrary! Practicality rules and you are going to want a lover who is a team player. There’s a strong physical vibe going on right now so you and your amour should be engaged in sports– both inside and outside the bedroom.

"
21 may 2018,aquarius,"Are you an open book? Sometimes it’s smart to be that way, other times it’s not…which is something that ancient astrologers were keenly aware of. Today is a good time to think about just how much information you put out there about yourself. If in doubt, don’t say it.

"
22 may 2018,aquarius,"If you’ve been considering a side hustle (or you’ve already got one going) today is a good time for taking things to the next level. Home based businesses are especially strong for Aquarians these days, and this includes a day job that enables you to work out of the house a few days a week.

"
23 may 2018,aquarius,"Wishful thinking isn’t going to get you anywhere, Aquarius. You may have some interesting day dreams going on, but a well structured life is built on a strong foundation. Build that first, then go after the extras.

"
24 may 2018,aquarius,"You’ve got charisma in spades, so work it, Aquarius! Now’s the perfect time to show off your image, ideas and talent. Don’t worry about what others think; with next week’s full moon occurring in your house of networking, the time is ripe for impressing other people. 

"
25 may 2018,aquarius,"Balancing logic and creativity are a snap thanks to an unusual Jupiter-Neptune trine. The best part is that you can harness this energy to make more money, always a blessing. They say that fortune favors the bold, but with this aspect it also favors those who can think out of the box.

"
26 may 2018,aquarius,"Keep your personal business to yourself, Aquarius. Romantic matters, family issues and housing decisions don’t need to be discussed with everyone out there. Your own personal wisdom is strong—don’t be afraid to tap into it.

"
27 may 2018,aquarius,"It’s the weekend and you may want to play, but your chart suggests that you need to get caught up on some grunt work. You can justify procrastinating in all sorts of ways, but in the end the chores will still be there. So why not get it over and done with now?

"
28 may 2018,aquarius,"Your sign is known for its friendly spirit, and today’s full moon falls in your house of networking and meeting new people! No matter how much you love your tribe, the cosmos is telling you to shake things up a bit. Seek out people who enjoy the same hobbies or sports that you do and start sharing experiences with them too.

"
29 may 2018,aquarius,"Aligning yourself with people who share your values and dreams becomes easier with today’s full moon in the most friendly part of your chart! It’s also a great time to plan some networking events and parties, or to attend some interesting soirees. Your life could use a reboot: find people with a sense of adventure.

"
30 may 2018,aquarius,"Just because someone is a friend or treated colleague doesn’t mean that they need to hear all the details about your life. Nor do you need to go in with them on their latest escapade. Pull away if you need to and wait for this to pass.

"
31 may 2018,aquarius,"It should be easier to get to the bottom of what’s bothering you as a cathartic Saturn-Moon aspect is in the heavens. Your relationships with other people are a big focus these days, and wise Saturn will help you smooth things over.

"
2 june 2018,aquarius,"Give yourself a break, Aquarius! According to your chart you’ve been pushing yourself too hard. With gentle Venus in the house of health care, it’s time for some overdue pampering. True, you probably should eat better and exercise, but this weekend it’s all about taking things easy.

"
3 june 2018,aquarius,"Anyone who thinks they can talk their way around you is in for a big surprise! You’re the one with the gift of gab, creative expression and outright flirting. So work it, because the cosmos is dousing you with magnetism.

"
4 june 2018,aquarius,"Love and family matters can often be confusing, but today your vision is 20/20 when it comes to these topics. A highly practical Sun-Mercury aspect is just the ticket for seeing what’s really going on. Wait until Tuesday the 16th to start laying down some new rules.

"
5 june 2018,aquarius,"Aquarians are famous for being team players, but that goes out the window today with a stinky Venus-Pluto opposition. Every cell in your body may rebel against going along with the crowd or cooperating in some way. Whether you can afford to do this or not is a other story!

"
6 june 2018,aquarius,"Creative people like to brag about how they love to break the rules. But sometimes you can tap into your talents much better if you follow a certain discipline, something that the cosmos is telling you right now. First figure out how to do things the right way—then  break the rules.

"
7 june 2018,aquarius,"Spending on swag and entertainment may sound like a good idea, but the cosmos warns against it. Do you really need a $15 martini or a $1000 It Bag? Hold off on spending for now. More spending days lie ahead; save for now.

"
8 june 2018,aquarius,"Feeling like a social butterfly? You should be with the Moon in your house of partying! But don’t feel too free and easy, telling everyone your private business. Subterranean Pluto warns that you could spill too much intel.

"
9 june 2018,aquarius,"Your sign is so open and free that you don’t stoop to passive-aggressive games. But others do, and you need to protect yourself from their machinations. Steer clear of anyone who gives you a funny vibe.

"
10 june 2018,aquarius,"It’s a good day to get your house in order, Aquarius, so spend some time decluttering. Once energetic Mercury enters the most productive part of your chart on Tuesday, you’ll be even more determined to live a more streamlined life. The less mess, the less stress….and the more serenity you’ll enjoy.

"
11 june 2018,aquarius,"Nervous much? From your chart it appears that you’re worried about what others think of you, especially bosses, parents, key clients or people in positions of authority. But this is just your imagination. They actually have a high opinion of you, so stop being so paranoid!

"
12 june 2018,aquarius,"Your productivity goes through the roof now that Mercury is in your house of getting things done! Over the next few weeks you should be actively searching for hacks and better systems that will streamline your life, both at home and at work. This is also an awesome time to get in shape by creating new diet and fitness habits….and sticking with them.

"
13 june 2018,aquarius,"Tonight’s new moon has a double dose of good luck, Aquarius! It occurs in your house of romance (finding new love, enhancing an existing relationship). And at the same time, amorous Venus glides into your house of commitment. Can you say “I do”? The next few months are fabulous for matters of the heart.

"
14 june 2018,aquarius,"A loved one may act out today, catching you off guard. Unpredictable Uranus is in a snit and making people somewhat defensive and argumentative. Fortunately, peacemaker Venus is in the most diplomatic part of your chart, so you should be able to sail through this tempest in a teapot.

"
15 june 2018,aquarius,"What people say and what they mean may be two different things today, Aquarius. It’s not that they’re trying to deceive you; they actually think that their ideas are on point. But they may not have thought things through well enough, something that your razor sharp intuition will pick up on.

"
16 june 2018,aquarius,"Getting your financial life in order is on the cosmos’ agenda for your sign, and from the looks of it you need to develop better habits. Start going through your statements now, and while you’re at it consider new ways to earn more. A side hustle could be the way to go.

"
17 june 2018,aquarius,"There is no room in your life for bad habits and inefficient systems and people. The planets are asking you to clean up your own act, and then take a look at other people in your world who are creating too much chaos. Pull it together now–or deal with the drama and stress later.

"
18 june 2018,aquarius,"Over the next few months it’s critical to be on top of your finances, now that murky Neptune is retrograde in your house of income and budgeting. Start be developing better saving habits, then start considering new ways of earning more.

"
19 june 2018,aquarius,"Get outta my way! That’s the Aquarius battle cry as practical Mercury puts you in a mood to get things done. There’s no room in your life for slackers or inefficient systems. You can make a lot of progress, so create a short list of things (or people!) who are holding you back.

"
20 june 2018,aquarius,"Getting a handle on your health and fitness is a snap with today’s Mercury-Neptune connection. Mercury is all about doing things the smart way, and glamorous Neptune is in the wellness sector. Creating better habits (and sticking to them) is a real possibility, so even if you fell off the wagon before, you can get back on it.

"
21 june 2018,aquarius,"Just how good are your habits and systems, Aquarius? If they need improvement you now have the chance to take care of things. That’s because the Sun just entered your house of efficiency, the place where we clean up our acts—at the office, at home and also with our bodies! That’s right, getting fit will be the name of the game over the next 4 weeks. Home gyms are favored in your chart, so consider one.

"
22 june 2018,aquarius,"Family members may be surprisingly cooperative over the next few days, so now’s a good time to rope them in to getting things done around the house! It’s also an auspicious moment for settling battles. With next week’s full moon arriving in your house of closure, you’re in the mood for putting things behind you.

"
23 june 2018,aquarius,"Your logical mind is battling your intuition today–which one will win? From the looks of your chart, I’d say to pay closer attention to your gut than your mind. This energy will repeat itself on Wednesday, so be prepared to operate on a vibey level.

"
24 june 2018,aquarius,"Sometimes we have to take a good long look at what we’ve got going on in our lives and assess them. If anything or anyone is simply too much effort or trouble, then it may be time to move on. You can only focus on so many things at a time.

"
25 june 2018,aquarius,"From your chart it appears that you just want some peace and quiet in a relationship, dammit! And a sense of stability wouldn’t hurt either. However, the people around you may not be coming from a chill or diplomatic place. Once Mercury changes signs on Friday you’ll be able to communicate your needs to them.

"
26 june 2018,aquarius,"What’s most important to you,  Aquarius? With energetic Mars now retrograding in your sign, it’s time to stop traveling at warp speed and take a breather. The full moon on Thursday is the best time in 2018 for you to do some serious thinking in solitude.

"
27 june 2018,aquarius,"You have certain standards that you don’t want to bend, but don’t make a big deal about it. As a matter of fact you’re better off keeping that information to yourself. If others know where you’re coming from they might try to sway you to their way of thinking.

"
28 june 2018,aquarius,"You may have completely had it with playing by the rules, and tonight’s full moon could make that painfully obvious. But it also appears that you could benefit from creating some better habits and routines. Create your own rules and live by them—you can’t go wrong that way.

"
29 june 2018,aquarius,"You’re currently in a bit of a weird place astrologically speaking: on the one hand, you’re craving solitude, and on the other hand you need to mix with people. Mercury just entered one of the most diplomatic, cooperative parts of your chart. Balance “me” time with “people” time and you’ll be fine.

"
30 june 2018,aquarius,"Feeling like the only logical person in your family? From your chart it sure looks that way! They could be more than ready to push your buttons, so if you want a quiet weekend, pull away from them if possible. Your best bet is to let them figure things out for themselves.

"
1 july 2018,aquarius,"You’re on the right track and you know what you’re doing. So don’t pay attention to people who are trying to tell you otherwise, no matter how well meaning they are. That said, you still need to cooperate, so do your own thing and say little about it.

"
3 july 2018,aquarius,"Your career is picking up steam, thanks to generous Jupiter creating some terrific aspects now and through next week. Practicality and logic count more than crazy ideas, so think creatively yet rationally.

"
4 july 2018,aquarius,"Big plans of yours are going to start to develop momentum next week, so if you’re smart you’ll start recharging your batteries right now. The problem is that you can’t seem to walk away from your responsibilities. Don’t worry, the world won’t collapse if you take a day off.

"
5 july 2018,aquarius,"Impressing higher-ups is a snap thanks to a positive Sun-Jupiter aspect. Also, if you’re planning on moving forward with a big plan start doing the grunt work on it now. Things will take pff rapidly due to next week’s solar eclipse.

"
6 july 2018,aquarius,"Assertive Mars is in your sign, possible making you fierce and independent—perhaps too much so for other people. Be careful to not offend people whose help you may need in the future.

"
7 july 2018,aquarius,"Need to hide from your family today? That could be the case with erratic Uranus acting up in your domestic sector. Of course, if someone needs your help you should be there for them. But otherwise, steer clear of known divas and malcontents. With so much activity in your goals sector you really need to look out for number one.

"
8 july 2018,aquarius,"Everyone knows that Aquarians are true team players. The problem, of course, is not everyone else wants to be part of a team! Fortunately a potent Neptune aspect today helps you rally people around. You may need to create new roles for people and change the rules of the game a bit, but everything should work out well.

"
9 july 2018,aquarius,"Ready to score some serious dinero? In astrology, there are two planets that govern profitability. One is Venus, which enters your net worth sector today. The other is Jupiter, which goes direct in your ambition sector tomorrow. This is one of the best times all year to start earning more, so start hustling.

"
10 july 2018,aquarius,"Your life is about to take a quantum leap forward, Aquarius. Jupiter, which has been retrograde in your house of goals, finally resumes direct motion. This is wonderful news for those of you whose plans have been stalled. But even more energy arrives on Friday, when a solar eclipse occurs in your house of efficiency and getting things done. Hope you’re well rested!

"
11 july 2018,aquarius,"Something unexpected yet appreciated could occur in your personal life today, Aquarius. This is especially true on the home front. A family member may offer you help. Perhaps a domestic argument is settled. You could also find the house of your dreams. A lover may ask you to move in with them or to get married. You’re in a practical mood these days, so any decisions that you make should be sound ones.

"
12 july 2018,aquarius,"Breaking away from old ways of doing thing can be difficult, Aquarius. But that’s exactly what the cosmos is asking you to do right now. Tomorrow solar eclipse occurs in your house of habits and routines. This is one of the best times in 2018 to make changes. Just how badly do you want to hold onto the past, and the crummy habits that went along with it?

"
13 july 2018,aquarius,"It’s not enough to have #goals; you need the right habits and strategies to make them happen. Fortunately a solar eclipse in your house of efficiency will help you get there. But old habits die hard, and fears can get in your way. No problem. Just take one small step at a time and the momentum will build.

"

Things that you thought would never happen, or ideas that you thought were fantasies may actually have the chance to manifest.

"
15 july 2018,aquarius,"Got a lot of emotions building up inside of you? Then today’s a smart time to let them out. Spontaneous Uranus is active in your house of contentment and security. Holding things in won’t serve anyone, especially you.

"
16 july 2018,aquarius,"Psychologists say that there is a difference between happiness and contentment. Happiness is a state that comes from external things coming your way. Contentment, on the other hand, is an internal feeling that travels with you no matter what is going on in your life. Today is the perfect time to examine just what makes you happy and what you need to be truly content.

"
17 july 2018,aquarius,"Stop beating yourself up, Aquarius! From your chart it appears that you’re being self-critical about the things that you say and how you present yourself. This passes quickly. By the time the weekend rolls around, the Moon will be in a much better place to make you feel authoritative again.

"
18 july 2018,aquarius,"You’ll be able to accomplish more over the next few days than you’ve been able to do all year, if you choose to! The remainder of this week is the perfect time to chase after personal goals and ambitions. Once the Sun rolls into Leo on Sunday, you’re going to have to cooperate with others more closely.

"
19 july 2018,aquarius,"People around you are paying attention to your skills and how you get things done. You’re in a great spot to impress decision-makers, so don’t start to fall back and get comfortable. Once the Sun enters Leo on Sunday, it’s quite possible that people may ask to partner up with you.

"

"
21 july 2018,aquarius,"With a lunar eclipse occurring in one week’s time in your sign, you should be wrapping up initiatives that are important to you. Fortunately the two luckiest planets in the solar system, Venus and Jupiter, are in talks today to bring you more money. More career prestige is also in the stars.

"
22 july 2018,aquarius,"Whose life is it, anyway? Are you your own person, or do you have to answer to the demands of others? That’s the question as the Sun enters Leo today, your house of diplomacy and relationships. But the upcoming lunar eclipse in Aquarius this Friday is lighting a fire under you to have things done your way.

"
23 july 2018,aquarius,"How you spend your time and energy is important, Aquarius. So is who you spend it with. Don’t waste your precious life and emotions on people or situations that don’t fill you with joy. This Friday’s eclipse is the perfect time to close out things from the past.

"
24 july 2018,aquarius,"A fool and their money are soon parted, Aquarius. That’s an old saying but it certainly applies to you today. Luxe-loving Venus and deceptive Neptune are at war today in financial houses. Don’t succumb to the allure of putting everything on plastic. Save your money for a rainy day.

"
25 july 2018,aquarius,"Ignoring problems won’t make them go away, Aquarius. You may suddenly realize today that you have to take action on some of these issues. Your personal serenity and comfort depend upon it.

"
26 july 2018,aquarius,"Are you surrounded by the right kind of people, Aquarius? That’s the question that the cosmos asks of you as Mercury begins to retrograde in Leo. Friday’s lunar eclipse occurs in your sign, making you all the more aware of your own needs. It’s one thing to be diplomatic and cooperative; it’s another to give up who you are for other people.
 

"
27 july 2018,aquarius,"Go ahead and take a bow, Aquarius! Today’s lunar eclipse occurs in your sign. Something that is very important to you may come to a successful conclusion, either over the next few days or over the next few months. Patience matters right now. Aggressive Mars is tearing through your sign, making you want everything immediately. Give things time to manifest.

"
28 july 2018,aquarius,"Yum! It’s time to dive into some of your most secretive fantasies thanks to a delicious Venus-Pluto aspect. This is a wonderful time naturally for romance, the kind that takes place behind closed doors. But if you’re single and looking, chances are you can find a sexy soulmate.

"
29 july 2018,aquarius,"You need to use more logic and less emotions when it comes to resolving issues with loved ones. This may not be easy as the Moon in your sign is stirring up your heart. But give other people a chance. Furthermore, give yourself a chance to calm down and think things through rationally.

"
30 july 2018,aquarius,"You are in a great position to impress people in positions of authority, Aquarius. Don’t forget–– your hard work and talents are worth money. Don’t be afraid to ask for it!

"
31 july 2018,aquarius,"It’s time to stop being so practical! Yes, you need to get things done and yes, you’re not in the mood for doing anything foolish. But why not loosen up a little bit with all of these rules you have about how your life should be run?

"
1 august 2018,aquarius,"People could push your buttons today, and chances are you won’t be too happy about it.With aggressive Mars in your sign, you could lash out against anyone who goes up against you. This is especially true if you perceive that your security is being threatened. But is it really? By Saturday you’ll be feeling a heck of a lot better.

"
2 august 2018,aquarius,"This is a good day to show decision-makers that you have what it takes, Aquarius. You are able to juggle a lot at one time, something that has been noticed. Your ability to multitask could result in a new position and higher pay.

"
3 august 2018,aquarius,"Do what you can to avoid petty arguments today. This may not be easy, with the Moon in the most emotional part of your chart. And people may be trying to push your buttons. But your peace of mind is not worth it.

"
4 august 2018,aquarius,"Something unexpected could happen today when it comes to a domestic situation. Maybe you find the house or apartment of your dreams. Perhaps your lover asks you to move in with him! Or maybe a family battle is finally settled. At the very least, you should be feeling more content and relaxed at the end of the day.

"
5 august 2018,aquarius,"If there seem to be hidden under currents in relationships, you can blame it on Pluto. This mysterious planet is active today, helping you though. Your intuition will be sharp and you’ll be able to figure out what is going on behind the scenes.

"
6 august 2018,aquarius,"First the good news: Venus is now in the most freethinking, optimistic part of your chart. You are ready for some new adventures, which could include travel, study or entrepreneurship. Now for the less exciting part: people around you may feel like clipping your wings. Are you going to allow them to do that? Hell, no!

"
7 august 2018,aquarius,"Over the past few months you may have felt confined by the expectations of people in your world. This is especially true of family members and a lover. Now that independent Uranus is spinning backwards in your domestic sector, you will be feeling less rebellious. But this doesn’t mean that you’re going to give in to the demands of others! You’ll just be less annoyed about it.

"
9 august 2018,aquarius,"Just how much independence do you need… and how much comfort? That’s the question today as Venus is pitted against Saturn. If you’re smart, you’ll find a good balance between the two.

"
10 august 2018,aquarius,"You need to do a lot of thinking about the people you are partnering with. This is true in your personal life as well as your business one. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse occurs in your house of long-term relationships. You need team players, not someone who is going to boss you around. Passive-aggressive behavior also has to go if you are being subjected to it.

"
11 august 2018,aquarius,"Developing stronger relationships with others will be the focus of the next six months, Aquarius. Today’s solar eclipse highlights deeper bonds in romance and your business life. Just don’t be too anxious to give away your power. A difficult Jupiter aspect warns that you need balance in these unions.

"
12 august 2018,aquarius,"It looks like you need to do some serious reflecting, Aquarius. Mars is now retrograding through one of the most psychological parts of your chart. Issues from the past may bubble up to the surface of your mind, demanding to be resolved. If you’re smart you will deal with them and move on. This retrograde period ends on the 27th, so you have about two weeks to do some important work.

"
13 august 2018,aquarius,"Just because something glitters doesn’t mean that it’s made of gold! This holds true of people, job offers and anything else that may catch your fancy today. If something or someone appeals to you, wait twenty-four hours before you make your move.

"
14 august 2018,aquarius,"Sometimes you have to push real hard to get things done… other times you don’t. A positive Venus aspect today indicates that you can move mountains without breaking a sweat. Consider how you can simplify things and take a much easier road than killing yourself all the time.

"
15 august 2018,aquarius,"Stick up for yourself today, Aquarius. Your opinions and ideas have value. Someone may try to denigrate them, either to your face or behind the scenes.

"

"
23 august 2018,aquarius,"Your love life should start to get on a more even keel now that the Sun is in practical Virgo. As a matter of fact, the upcoming weekend is auspicious for deep talks about the future and opening up about your feelings. If you’re saying, “What love life?” know that you’re now in an excellent spot to meet someone. However, it’s critical to be selective. Don’t sell yourself short.

"
24 august 2018,aquarius,"Your intuition should be working overtime, thanks to the Moon and Mars blasting through the house of your subconscious mind. But this doesn’t mean that you should say what you’re picking up. Nor should you take action. Wait until the full moon on Sunday before you do anything.

"
25 august 2018,aquarius,"With the brilliant Sun moving through one of the most emotional parts of your chart, you should be able to recognize things that have been troubling you. There could be an “aha” moment when everything becomes crystal clear. And with wise Saturn in your house of healing, now’s the time to let this stuff go.
 

"
26 august 2018,aquarius,"Ready to cash in? The full moon in Pisces could bring a new job offer, promotion or revenue stream your way. But it’s imperative that you carefully vet any promises made, such as bonuses or commission dollars. If you’re self-employed double check your projections. Take your time before making decisions and don’t let anyone push you into anything that you’re not sure about.

"
27 august 2018,aquarius,"Your imagination is a fertile playground, thanks to a bevy of planets touring the house of your subconscious mind. And it’s going to become a lot more active over the next few weeks. If you’re smart you’ll pay close attention to your dreams and gut hunches, as they can provide important keys.

"
28 august 2018,aquarius,"My way or the highway? People could be in that kind of mood today, and that includes you. Try to be as diplomatic as possible, even if others aren’t. Let them develop a reputation for being pig headed!

"
29 august 2018,aquarius,"Need to gain greater control of a situation? Then the best way to pull that off is by pulling back. Work behind the scenes. Say little. Don’t show all of your cards. And don’t let anyone tell you that this is sneaky; this is cosmos-approved smart strategy.

"
30 august 2018,aquarius,"Trying to talk sense to people probably will go nowhere due to a Moon-Venus opposition. And so will trying to explain the bigger picture or a grand vision. You’re better off keeping your opinions to yourself and let others figure things out on their own.

"
31 august 2018,aquarius,"A solution to a personal problem may appear from out of the blue, and if you’re smart, you’ll run with it. This is especially true of family matters or a situation within a love relationship. You may need to bend a little bit, but the end result will be worth it.

"
1 september 2018,aquarius,"Steer clear of people who try to pull you into schemes or relationships that you know are not right for you. But from your chart it appears that there will be plenty of people around you who can bring you joy, so the moral of the story is to be selective.

"
2 september 2018,aquarius,"You’re an independent soul, but these days you may need people more than you’d care to admit. Let’s face it, you don’t have all the answers. You could learn a lot from others, so let them into your world.

"
3 september 2018,aquarius,"It appears that you need a break from the same-old, same-old. And with Venus in your house of adventure and travel, you should start planning some trips and night out on the town. Signing up for a class is also in the stars—something just for the fun of it!

"
4 september 2018,aquarius,"There is no room for passive aggressive behavior today, Aquarius. Whether it’s coming from you or from someone else, it’s completely unnecessary—-and unwanted. Make sure that you’re not the perp. Once Saturn goes direct on Thursday you’ll be able to handle difficult people much more easily.

"
5 september 2018,aquarius,"Details count, whether you’re trying to finesse a situation at work or make your home more beautiful. They count when you’re trying to let a lover know how much you care about them. Now that verbal mercury is in Virgo, you have the opportunity to pour attention into everything that you do.

"
6 september 2018,aquarius,"You have been going through a period of deep inner healing, Aquarius. Subterranean Pluto an mature Saturn have both been retrograde in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. As a result you may have been releasing a lot of mental junk that you no longer need. The good news is that Saturn goes direct today, and any good habits and thought patterns that you created should stick.

"
7 september 2018,aquarius,"Your prospects are improving on the two fronts that people tend to care about the most: love and money! Shrewd Mercury will help you uncover some wise investments or business deals. Independent Uranus will let you express yourself freely in matters of the heart, or to find someone new. There is a surprise aspect to this, and a long term one too.

"
8 september 2018,aquarius,"People might take desperate measures to get their way. They might also not be upfront about it. And from your chart, it appears that you’re getting tired of taking the high road all the time. You’re nobody’s fool, something that you can start letting people know once Venus changes signs tomorrow.

"
10 september 2018,aquarius,"Ready to do things your way? I thought so. You’ll be happy to know that ambitious Mars has just entered Aquarius, highlighting your needs and desires. Things heat up later this week when it comes to your love life and finances, so get ready to dive in.

You can create a deeper bond with a lover, or find a sexy new soulmate. Likewise you could impress muckety mucks who think that you’re the right person for a job. Work, honey.

"
13 september 2018,aquarius,"Finding the right balance between your heart and your head is not going to be easy today. Things could get even more complicated if people are not being direct with you, which is a possibility. Fortunately logical Mercury is in a good position to balance out your emotions. Don’t make any major decisions; wait for the weekend.

"
14 september 2018,aquarius,"You may be sensing an undercurrent today, Aquarius. Even though things seem lively and OK on the outside, your subconscious mind is trying to figure out what’s really going on. But the fact is that your brain maybe coming up with fears and concerns that aren’t based on reality. Try to remain objective.

"
15 september 2018,aquarius,"You will be able to dig deep into reservoirs of strength that you didn’t even realize you had. Behind the scenes you are changing in ways that you haven’t experienced before. That’s what transformation is all about, and over the next two weeks there will be even more changes.

"
16 september 2018,aquarius,"A happy, sexy vibe exists today thanks to abundant Jupiter. It is  possible to have a calm romance that still sizzles and smolders. Singles, it’s time to dump the bad boys and the divas. If you’re already in a relationship, think about what needs to be done to bring more peace and libido into your union.

"
18 september 2018,aquarius,"Don’t fall prey to somebody else’s tantrums or guilt trips, Aquarius. With assertive Mars in your sign, you may be tempted to blast them with both barrels. But you don’t need to fire a cannon to kill a mosquito, as they say. Just tell them calmly to find somebody else to dump on.

"
19 september 2018,aquarius,"A lady has to have some mystery about her, and that goes for you guys as well. Well, you are oozing a certain je ne sais quoi  today! Don’t be surprised if people are chasing you down, interested in getting to know your better. This goes for your professional life as well as your personal one.

"
20 september 2018,aquarius,"There’s no point in hiding your feelings. As a matter of fact, this is one of the best days all month to let people know what you’re thinking. It’s a smart time too, considering that the Sun will be moving on as of Saturday. Once that happens you’ll be too busy having adventures to sit around and vent!

"
21 september 2018,aquarius,"Don’t bite off more than you can chew, Aquarius. Over the next 24 hours both the Sun AND Mercury are heading into the most optimistic part of your chart. You run the risk of burning out. You also don’t want to over promise and under deliver. Patience is the key.

"
22 september 2018,aquarius,"Yee-ha! The Sun is now in the most adventurous part of your chart, joining strategic Mercury. The only problem you’ll have to face is figuring out which juicy idea (or person!) to pursue first. Once you get going , it’s possible that fears or concerns will pop up. Are they something to pay attention to, or are they figments of your (overexcited) imagination?

"
23 september 2018,aquarius,"Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously said, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” And the cosmos has the same message for you today. Irrational concerns and worries seem to be getting your way. Sweep them aside and go for it!

"
24 september 2018,aquarius,"Projects that you’ve been working on may finally get a green light! Tonight’s full moon occurs in the part of your chart that deals with the way you think and express yourself. Networking with other people, brainstorming and promoting are all very strong right now. Just be careful about the people you align with, as there could be some trolls in your midst.

"
25 september 2018,aquarius,"You might be ready to set off on a brand-new adventure, but from your chart it looks like you need to do more homework. That said, you shouldn’t get so stuck in details that you can’t get this idea or plan off the ground. Find a balance. Put one foot in front of the other and start moving.

"
26 september 2018,aquarius,"Your brain is as sharp as a tack these days, so use it to your advantage! With abundant Jupiter active in your house goals and dreams, you may have plenty of ideas. Pick the top three and figure out what to do next with them.

"
2 october 2018,aquarius,"They say that knowledge is power. And I would have to agree that that is a true statement. But the smart Aquarius keeps their knowledge to themselves today. A Mercury-Pluto square indicates that people will either be unwilling to listen to your wisdom, or they may steal your ideas and run with them. Neither scenario is a good one, so quietly blend into the background.

"
3 october 2018,aquarius,"Sexy meets practical today with a Moon-Venus meet-up. Your confidence is rising, so don’t be afraid to ask for what you want. No whiny wimps allowed here! Confidence is alluring, and you’ve got it in spades.

"
4 october 2018,aquarius,"Family members and loved ones could act out over the next week, and the “fun” starts today. Rebellious Uranus is in a snit, making people sulky and uncooperative. Make the decision now to not get annoyed. Otherwise, you’re looking at a lot of aggravation.

"
5 october 2018,aquarius,"Career plans could get stalled over the next few weeks now that profit-conscious Venus is retrograde. But that doesn’t mean that you should kick back and relax.

"
6 october 2018,aquarius,"This weekend you might feel like chucking all of your responsibilities and just have a good time. But the cosmos warns that you have to get some  of the grunt work done! Balance leisure time with your errands, so that you’ll free productive and relaxed too.

"
8 october 2018,aquarius,"The annual new Moon in your house of taking risks and breaking past old boundaries occurs today. But Uranus is in a harsh aspect from your house of comfort and security. Either you, or people around you, may be telling you not to fly to far too fast. With motivator Mars in your sign, however, you are going to go for it.

"
30 october 2018,aquarius,"Don’t be too hard on yourself if you feel as though it’s hard to stick with good habits these days! The Moon is in a funky spot, encouraging you to kick back and ignore the “rules”. That’s OK as long as you don’t let this become a regular routine!

"
31 october 2018,aquarius,"Over the next two weeks you may end up leaning on your friends more than you might expect. But hey—what are friends for? From your chart it appears that you’re on the verge of taking some interesting risks. Run them past your BFFs  before you make your decisions.

"
14 november 2018,aquarius,"Some surprising news could come your way, something that’ll put a smile on your face. With Mars in your sign, you’re open to new ideas and challenges. You don’t have to wait for New Year’s Eve to get started either.

"
15 november 2018,aquarius,"You need to be careful with your finances, Aquarius. Aggressive Mars is now in your house of income and savings, which could make you spend way too much.

"
19 november 2018,aquarius,"You need to stick to your guns, Aquarius. Other people maybe hellbent on getting you to do things their way. But “group think” is just not your thing. It’s one thing to cooperate with others; it’s another to sell your soul.

"

"
23 november 2018,aquarius,"Keep your friends and loved ones in the loop……sort of! They don’t need to know everything that you’re doing. Too many chefs spoil the sauce, as they say.

"
24 november 2018,aquarius,"You know what they say: “Money talks and bullsh** talks.” If you have felt that your financial situation has been murky, it could be because foggy Neptune was retrograde in your financial sector. It starts to move forward today, but you could still deal with some confusion early next week. Take things slow.

"
25 november 2018,aquarius,"The planets are in a very friendly place, encouraging you to socialize your little heart out. But that doesn’t mean that you should share your plans with everyone on the planet. Some things need to be kept private.

"
30 november 2018,aquarius,"Someone could say or do something today that will throw you off a bit. Chances are it will be petty nonsense, and as long as you realize that you’ll be fine. You’re in a pretty expansive place these days; don’t get caught up in other peoples’ dramas.

"
1 december 2018,aquarius,"Sometimes you hear people say that when they stopped doing so much, that they actually achieved more. That’s the kind of vibe you’ve got going on in the week ahead.

It looks like you should cut back on some activities or ideas and get laser focused on just a few,

"
2 december 2018,aquarius,"There is a lot of activity in the part of your chart that deals with career and ambition. The problem is that you may be surrounded by people who are too interested in giving their opinions. Yes, it’s wise to seek advice. But in the end you have to make your own decisions.

"
3 december 2018,aquarius,"“Everybody’s talking at me, I can’t hear word they’re saying”. Those words are from an old Harry Nilsson song, and they sure do apply to you this week.

"
5 december 2018,aquarius,"The holidays are coming and people are in a partying mood. From your chart it looks like people may be trying to pull you into their adventures. But is this wise? Make sure that you also take care of business while you’re running around having fun.

"
10 december 2018,aquarius,"Do you believe that you create your own reality? You don’t have to be a victim, you know. Cosmic activity in the most authoritative part of your chart is encouraging you to seize the reins. Don’t wait for fate to dump goodies in your lap.

"
12 december 2018,aquarius,"A new year is arriving: what is important to you, and what isn’t? Now that Mercury is in your house of values, you should be focused on what really counts. While you’re at it, ask yourself if people close to you share these values too.

"
13 december 2018,aquarius,"It’s one thing to help a friend or colleague and another to overdo it. People need to know that they’re responsible for their own work and problems. Help but don’t enable.

"
14 december 2018,aquarius,"Who wants to follow the crowd? Not you, not today. You’re in a mindset where you want to stick with what makes you  comfortable. Forget about what others want and do your own thing.

"
15 december 2018,aquarius,"Is one of your 2019 resolutions to make (and save) more money? If that’s the case, then perhaps you should do some deep thinking this weekend about why you may not have enough of it right now. The past is gone. You’re not stuck earning a lousy income.

17 december 2018,aquarius,"Anyone who has been underestimating you is a fool, Aquarius! You’re getting into fighting shape behind the scenes, and by this I mean mentally and emotionally. Keep ’em in the dark. Eventually they’ll figure things out, and you’ll enjoy the look of shock on their faces.

"
18 december 2018,aquarius,"Brilliant minds think alike! Spend some time today with people who think like you. Better yet, hang out with those who have ideas that force you to stretch the boundaries of your own mind. Yes, you can  become a visionary.

"
19 december 2018,aquarius,"There are only so many hours in a day, and it appears that you’re trying to take advantage of every blessed one. Which means that you may be on the verge of burning out. You have until Friday to hustle, because after that its time for some much needed R and R.

"
21 december 2018,aquarius,"The planets are suggesting that you slow down the pace of life a little, not easy to do. People want to hang out with you and work is calling. But now that the Sun is in Capricorn, it’s time to rest and recharge your batteries. Until it’s YOUR birthday season, that is.

"
22 december 2018,aquarius,"Try to wrap up everything that needs to be finished for 2018.

The next few weeks are perfect for some much-needed rest and relaxation. Start pampering yourself as soon as you can.

"
23 december 2018,aquarius,"Let everyone else run around in hysterics. You’ll manage to stay cool, calm and collected regardless as to what is going on. Sometimes having that 30,000 foot view is a great advantage!

"
24 december 2018,aquarius,"People may not be able to agree on things. And it’s possible that they want to change their roles in a relationship or group effort. Let this go until Friday, when there are better aspects for making things work. Besides, you’ll be in control by then!

"
25 december 2018,aquarius,"Merry Christmas, Aquarius! The moon is in your opposite sign, Leo, which is your house of relationships. As a result, all close relationships are featured today. Neptune is inspiring you to have serious conversations about the future. To get the best results, switch up your approach.

"
26 december 2018,aquarius,"Someone whom you haven’t heard from in a long time may reach out to you today. Or maybe you’re thinking about people from your past. Either way, a happy Uranus aspect is just the ticket for reconnecting with old friends. It’s also a great time for opening up the lines of communication with a lover.

"
27 december 2018,aquarius,"With stubborn Mars in your house of ritual and routine, people may think that you are very set in your ways. Perhaps you are! Who cares? It’s people like you who know how to get things done.

"
28 december 2018,aquarius,"You could be lost in thought today, but this is not a bad thing. Actually it’s advisable.

"
29 december 2018,aquarius,"You may have a come-to-Jesus moment when it comes to your finances. The reality may hit you that you have a lot of work to do and a long way to go. That’s okay. With Mars getting ready to enter your house of self-promotion, you should be prepared to hustle and let the world know that you exist.

"
30 december 2018,aquarius,"There could be some unexpected news today, or someone may say something surprising. You may be tempted to give your opinion, but don’t. Allow several days to suss out the situation before you weigh in.

"
31 december 2018,aquarius,"It’s New Year’s Eve… do you feel like partying? I sure hope so, because Mars has just entered your house of socializing.

"
2 january 2018,pisces,"Who count you count on the most, Pisces? That’s the question posed by stern Saturn and the independent Sun as they meet up in your house of friends and networking.

"
8 march 2018,pisces,"While this is one of the best years in over a decade for you to put yourself out there and try new things, it would be wise to spend the next four months carefully thinking things through before you launch. No, Mercury isn’t retrograde but Jupiter is! This gas giant may have been making you overly confident about pulling things off. Now that it’s retrograde it’s time to slow down and proceed more slowly.

"
9 march 2018,pisces,"It’s your birthday season and no doubt you have new plans you’d like to dive into. A Moon-Mars aspect today is auspicious for career matters, so use this energy to your benefit.

"
10 march 2018,pisces,"Setting boundaries with people may not be your strong suit, Pisces, but it may be necessary over the next few days.  Others need to know their roles and responsibilities. The more easy going you are, the less likely it is that they’ll comply. Toughen up.

"
11 march 2018,pisces,"Trying to work well with others may be a fruitless task this week, Pisces, starting today. A Mercury-Saturn standoff indicates that people won’t be in the mood to cooperate, so why waste your time trying?

"
12 march 2018,pisces,"Pay close attention to your values, Pisces. Are they still in sync with the person you have become? The same goes for the people you hang out with, your choice of occupation and all the other details that make up your life. Now is an excellent time for change.

"
13 march 2018,pisces,"Stern Saturn is in the house that governs your most cherished dreams, many of which cost money. The problem is that luxury-loving Venus feels like spending on swag and other goodies. Saturn’s gonna win this battle, so put the credit cards away and be sensible.

19 march 2018,pisces,"Why is it so much easier to love someone else than it is to love yourself? So often we’re hard on ourselves, tougher than anyone else would ever be. The cosmos asks you to indulge in some sweet self-love today. Then why not make it a daily habit?

"
20 march 2018,pisces,"Show me the money? With the Sun now in your income sector, you could be mighty interested in earning more. Start doing research, but let your own personal values and wisdom be your guide. Other people may be way too interested in seeing you do things their way.

"
21 march 2018,pisces,"No matter how much you may want others to go along with your plans, you may face resistance. But trying to use force, flattery, guilt or any other manipulative tactic will backfire. Just worry about yourself for now.

"
22 march 2018,pisces,"Business deals and job offers might slow down thanks to Mercury now swimming backward in your income zone.

"
23 march 2018,pisces,"Finding common ground with a lover or friend could prove to be difficult over the next few days, Pisces. You’re coming from a practical place—are they? And they may be mighty stubborn too. Don’t give in; stick to your values and dreams.

"
24 march 2018,pisces,"If you feel like going off and hiding from the world today, no one would blame you! A tense Mars-Sun faceoff could make friends, family or co-workers act out or not play like team members. It’s up to you whether you decide to join the fray or not. My advice? Stay away!

"
25 march 2018,pisces,"You should be proud of your achievements, and the good news is that there are more to come! Your creativity is high today thanks to the Moon in the house of talent, so apply your skills to what matters the most to you.

"
26 march 2018,pisces,"You need to walk the walk and talk the talk, Pisces. If you don’t then other people will be happy to point out your failings. Be honest with yourself. Are you saying one thing then doing another?

"
27 march 2018,pisces,"Quit being so nitpicky and get on with it already. From your chart it appears that you’re so stuck on details and small stuff that you’re losing momentum. Try to take a 30,000 foot view of your life in order to get a clearer perspective.

"
28 march 2018,pisces,"If you want more stability in your life and less chaos, start with yourself. After all, you can’t control what other people do. The ancient Taoists believed that the true masters were people who had finessed this skill. Remain in the center of the storm and let things take their natural course.

"
29 march 2018,pisces,"Getting everyone to agree or work as a team could be frustrating. You  may be willing to pitch in and do your share, but others may not be. Save yourself a lot of anxiety and resentment and do your own thing.

"
4 april 2018,pisces,"Egos could spiral out of control, especially within a group or team. Trying to talk sense to people could be useless, so don’t waste your time. You’re not their therapist or whipping boy/girl.

"
5 april 2018,pisces,"As our circumstances change in life, so do our values. Why continue to go through your days with a set of values or dreams that no longer suits who you’ve become? From your chart it appears that you may decide to simplify by cutting back on commitments and connections.

"
6 april 2018,pisces,"What really motivates you, Pisces? You might be surprised what your true desires are, if you dig deep enough. What other people think about your ideas is meaningless. Become obsessed with your dreams if that’s what it takes.

"
7 april 2018,pisces,"Being a team player is important over the next few weeks, but that doesn’t mean that you have to sell out at the same time. Stick to your principles, speak your mind and honor the ideas that others espouse.

"
10 april 2018,pisces,"Give ’em an inch and they’ll take a mile! Unless you want everyone dumping their duties and problems on you, you’ll need to set some boundaries. Don’t feel guilty about it either; it’s not your job in life to be their enabler.

"
11 april 2018,pisces,"Men are from Mars and women are from Venus, so they say, but today those two planets are in a fabulous angle. Which means that you could meet a new flame, get on the same page with a lover or enjoy a fabulous night out on the town.

Over the next few months you can make some big changes in your career or business, pulling in more cash and saving it.

21 april 2018,pisces,"FOMO and other little pangs of jealousy could erupt today, either at your end or on the part of a friend or lover. Jealousy is a completely useless emotion, only creating unhappiness within the person experiencing it. Step away from people who area acting snippy, and keep that green eyed monster under control in your mind too.

"
22 april 2018,pisces,"Aligning yourself with movers and shakers is in the cosmos’ agenda for you, Pisces! No one’s telling you to dump old friends or colleagues who are true blue, but it appears that your contact list could use some updating. Do some digging over the next few months. Put yourself in places where you will be seen.

"
23 april 2018,pisces,"The dynamics of a group may need to be adjusted, whether it’s within your family, friends or a team at the office. Just don’t push too hard, a possibility with aggressive Mars in your house of networking. But stress the need to operate as a team and for everyone to do their fair share.

"
24 april 2018,pisces,"The comforts of home will be calling your name now that Venus is in your house of nesting. But a full moon is coming in your house of long distance travel, too! Who says that you can’t do both?

"
25 april 2018,pisces,"People may not be thinking rationally, which could create turmoil within a group’s dynamics. Trying to talk sense to them won’t work, so don’t bother. Not today, anyhow. Tomorrow is a much better day to get everyone back in agreement, although you may need to be cracking the whip!

"
26 april 2018,pisces,"Remember that old corny saying, “there is no ‘I’ in the word “team’”? Keep it in mind over the next few days, as you run the risk of being way too pushy in group efforts. This may not be a bad thing if you need to whip a team into shape. But otherwise you might make enemies if you come on too strong.

"
27 april 2018,pisces,"Sometimes it gets pretty boring and conservative doing everything by the book, but hey, it’s often the smartest way to go. And today is one of those days. No matter how much you feel like rebelling against the man, the machine, the system or anyone else who’s annoying you, just remember the fable about the tortoise and the hare.

"
28 april 2018,pisces,"Your life is about to take some interesting, positive turns over the next few weeks, thanks to Monday’s full moon in the most expansive part of your chart. But this could bring out the green-eyed monster in others. TFB! If they want life’s goodies, it’s up to them to pursue them.

"
29 april 2018,pisces,"The planets are encouraging you to take more chances in life, and that includes making new connections. But don’t be too quick to join forces with someone just because they show up in your environment. Make sure that these people think the way you do, like the same kinds of activities and know how to have a good time! If you’re the shy type, seek out friends who will pull you out of your shell.

"
30 april 2018,pisces,"If your gut has been telling you to take a chance, there’s a good reason! Tonight’s full moon in your optimistic, free wheeling house of adventure is spurring you to break out of an old routine. You won’t have any trouble either in finding people who want to join you on your escapades.

"
1 may 2018,pisces,"The full moon in Scorpio yesterday is lighting a fire under you to bust out of an old groove and take some chances. But Uranus is freaking out from your house of stability and income. The message is this: don’t take any chances that could put your financial situation at risk. Finding new friends, making yourself over, and studying different philosophies or religions are all non-risky chances to take!

"
2 may 2018,pisces,"Family members and close connections could get a little pushy today, and you may simply not have the energy to deal with it. Giving in isn’t a smart plan, nor is fighting back. A stellar lunar aspect tomorrow suggests that you hang out with trusted friends, people who aren’t trying to get their way.

"
3 may 2018,pisces,"If there’s a book, blog, screenplay or piece of graphic art that’s been floating around in your head, start working on it. Then get ready to launch with the new moon on May 15th. Your words and ideas have power, the kind that can bring in cash.

"
4 may 2018,pisces,"You may need to get a little tough with a friend or colleague but it’s necessary. They may need direction due to confusion in their lives . Or perhaps they’re overstepping their bounds in your relationship. There’s no need for drama though: this can be resolved calmly.

"
5 may 2018,pisces,"Your sign is not known for kissing up, but a little flattery could get you everywhere. From your chart it appears that you could connect with movers and shakers, people who can help you travel faster on your journey. Find them, introduce yourself and develop relationships with them.

"
6 may 2018,pisces,"People often accuse your sign of being indirect or downright flaky, but they don’t really get you, do they? Today is perfect for getting your point across without being demanding. Actually, you can be downright slick!

"
7 may 2018,pisces,"The flatterers and connivers will be out in force, so keep your hand on your wallet and your ego in check. Otherwise you’ll be easy prey for those who are only looking out for their own selfish agendas.

"
8 may 2018,pisces,"Be a straight shooter today, Pisces. Don’t leave any doubt in someone’s mind what you’re thinking or planning to do. This means being realistic about your emotions and plans that you have for the future. People aren’t mind readers: they need to know where you’re coming from.

"
9 may 2018,pisces,"A stellar Moon-Saturn aspect is helpful for meeting new people who could make a big difference in your life. This entire year is well aspected for expanding your contact list, but there are special days when it’s even easier. Today is one of them. Enjoy!

"
10 may 2018,pisces,"People often accuse your sign of being too day dreamy, but what the hell do they know? A luscious lunar aspect gives you permission to dream big. Tomorrow you might want to share your ideas with others, as Pluto is in an excellent spot from your house of friends and teamwork.

"
11 may 2018,pisces,"Start surrounding yourself with movers and shakers, Pisces. The company you keep will be ultra-important over the next eight years. Today a stellar Sun-Pluto aspect can introduce you to people who can open up some pretty interesting doors.

"
12 may 2018,pisces,"Avoid group think today, as the tribe could lead you astray. It’s wiser to march to the beat of your own drum, Pisces. With shrewd Mercury in a logical place, you’ll know what’s right and what is wrong.

"
13 may 2018,pisces,"Uranus spends one last day in your income sector, and it’s not coming back for another 84 years! This doesn’t mean that you won’t have the chance to earn more; you will. But Uranus sends you one last blast on inspiration today before it moves on. If you hit upon a idea, make sure you take action on it.

"
14 may 2018,pisces,"Ready to rebrand your company or shake up your image? Then start thinking about where you want to go with this. Some major planetary events over the next few days will give you the opportunity to get this in motion.

"
15 may 2018,pisces,"Anyone who thinks you’re the airy-fairy, woo-woo type is in for a ration of whoop ass, Pisces! Brilliant Uranus is now in your house of self-expression, making your sign the one to listen to. Between now and 2026 you can start a blog, write a screenplay (and see it turned into a movie), become a teacher, socialize like crazy, develop your artistic talents or hit the public speaking circuit. Don’t hold back!

"
16 may 2018,pisces,"Now that bold Uranus is in the most outspoken part of your chart, chances are you’ll want to go loud and proud. And a new moon is only adding fuel to this fire. But Mars enters your hush-hush house of confidentiality tomorrow, warning that you keep some things to yourself.

"
17 may 2018,pisces,"Ouch! Don’t speak your mind today as the backlash could be intense. Yes, you’re entitled to your opinions and yes, you may be smarter than others. But revealing too much could end up harming you. Sometimes silence is the best way to operate.

"
18 may 2018,pisces,"It’s time to tell your tribe what’s on your mind, Pisces. This could be your family, friends, a department at work or some other team that you’re part of. You may need to be the voice of reason within the group and the glue that holds it together. But you’ve got the chops to pull this off, so don’t hold back.

"
19 may 2018,pisces,"Got love on your mind? You should now that Venus is in the most heartfelt part of your chart! Show your love not only to a romantic partner, but also your kids and pets. Over the next three weeks you should be spending as much quality time with them as possible.

"
20 may 2018,pisces,"Your family and love life will be your focus for the next 4 weeks now that the Sun is in your warm and fuzzy domestic sector. Moving, redecorating, gardening and de-cluttering are also on the menu. Take a break from chores and cut back on work-related stress so that you can give loved ones your very best.

"
21 may 2018,pisces,"There are always smarter ways to do things and there is always someone out there who knows how to do it. Pick the brain of an expert, whether you’re trying to become a better parent, learn a foreign language or stick to your diet. Podcasts, websites, blogs and books are all good sources under this cosmic energy.

"
22 may 2018,pisces,"You can charm the birds from the trees with a winning Mercury-Neptune combo, so start schmoozing….and don’t feel guilty about it! No one is telling you to brown nose, but hey, a little flattery might get you somewhere.

"
23 may 2018,pisces,"Look before you leap, Pisces! Temptation is strong to jump into something new, but intelligent Mercury is telling you to slow down and consider what might happen. The full moon on Tuesday the 29th is in one of the most logical parts of your chart, so wait until then to make your next move.

"
24 may 2018,pisces,"This is one of the best days all year to find serenity, Pisces. The other eleven signs think that you have this down pat, but the reality is that you struggle with fears and negative emotions just like everyone else. Find a modality that works for you: journaling, therapy, mindfulness, sports, hobbies—whatever gets you centered and feeling at ease.

"
25 may 2018,pisces,"Yowza! What an amazing day to take what seems (to others) to be a crazy-ass idea, and to do something amazing with it! With profitable Jupiter in the sector that deals with entrepreneurship, the news media and global reach, you shouldn’t hesitate to boldly head off in a new direction. Let people say that you’re nuts; you’ll end up having the last laugh.

"
26 may 2018,pisces,"Gotta love it when the weekend is here and the planets are telling you to get out there and socialize. And that’s exactly what’s happening as chatty Mercury winks at Pluto in your house of networking. So get out there and schmooze, because you never know whom you might meet. 

"
27 may 2018,pisces,"Wishful thinking might take over, especially when it comes to your personal relationships. Make sure that you’re not putting someone on a pedestal or trusting them too much. This goes for friends as well as a lover or people you know from group activities. Remain logical….and wary.

"
28 may 2018,pisces,"The full moon is in your house of ambition, suggesting that a goal or wish could come to pass within the next few weeks. But before you embark on any new courses of action, make sure that you’re on a solid footing. Crazy ass dreams just don’t cut it these days.

"
29 may 2018,pisces,"Your career and other big goals get a boost from tonight’s full moon in your ambition sector. Over the next two weeks you may happily discover that some of the things you’ve been working on will come to pass. Make sure you celebrate your wins.

"
30 may 2018,pisces,"The full moon just fell in your house of ambition…so why are you sitting there, afraid to make a fresh move? Blame it on a Moon-Neptune aspect that is undermining your confidence. One of the smartest things that you can do is talk to a trusted mentor or friend.

"
31 may 2018,pisces,"Your idea as to what’s important is changing, Pisces. Values that may have seemed so important just a short time ago are now up for review. Feeling comfortable in your own skin and within your relationships is what it’s all about right now.

"
1 june 2018,pisces,"People always need someone to look up to, and right now you’re the one with the answers. And if you feel as though you don’t have the answers, you are blessed with a calm wisdom that and confidence that people will look up to. It’s time to help others who need some direction.

"
2 june 2018,pisces,"They say that “if you can dream it, you can do it”—but is that really true? From your chart it certainly looks that way! A winning trine between Venus and Neptune provides you with tons of creative inspiration. Don’t worry right now if your ideas seem crazy. You’ll have time to vet them.

"
3 june 2018,pisces,"You’re a vibey soul and today’s cosmic energy is going to increase your mental mojo. Mars and the Moon are hard at work, stirring up your psyche. Pay close attention to gut hunches, seemingly crazy ideas (they may not be!) and your dreams too.

"
4 june 2018,pisces,"No one can push our buttons like family and loved ones, right? But you’re nobody’s fool, not with a shrewd meet-up of the Sun and Mercury in the domestic part of your chart. Call people out on their behavior. They may put up resistance, but too bad. When you’re right, you’re right!

"
5 june 2018,pisces,"Finger pointing could be all around you as a Pluto-Venus opposition stirs up drama and jealousy. Do you really want to be a part of this scene? If not, hibernate over the next 48 hours until the pissy people calm down.

"
6 june 2018,pisces,"Family and loved ones working your nerves? That could be the case with a strenuous Mercury-Neptune aspect. If you can, pull away from their dramas for the next few days. The new moon next Wednesday is a much better time to get started afresh with them, as this lunation occurs in your domestic sector.

"
7 june 2018,pisces,"You could be feeling quite sensitive due to today’s Sun-Neptune square. But are the things you’re worrying about really true? When the Moon enters the most intuitive part of your chart tomorrow, you’ll be able to see things more clearly.

"
8 june 2018,pisces,"Keep your opinions to yourself this weekend, Pisces. With the Moon in the most perceptive part of your chart you could pick up a lot of hidden clues, but that doesn’t mean that you should voice what you’re thinking.

"
9 june 2018,pisces,"People may be anxious for you to go along with their plans, but should you? You’re coming from a far more rational place than they are! March to the beat of your own drum, Pisces.

"
10 june 2018,pisces,"This entire week will be a thoughtful one for you, Pisces, so don’t be surprised if you find yourself lost in contemplation. You will be be especially focused on your love and family lives, ready to smooth things over and start afresh with people.

"
11 june 2018,pisces,"Same old, same old! The planets are urging you to shake up your routine, and one of the best ways to do so is to take a trip out of town. Ancient astrologers knew that when we travel, our minds are expanded–which is why they placed philosophy, education and foreign travel in the same sector.

"
12 june 2018,pisces,"Which is ruling your world—your heart or your head? That’s going to be the big question over the next few weeks, Pisces. Today logical Mercury glides into your house of romance, and tomorrow touchy-feely Venus enters your house of practicality. Fortunately this won’t be a raging battle but a gentle tug-of-war.

"
13 june 2018,pisces,"Getting your life in order is what you should be thinking about these days, Pisces. The new moon takes place in your domestic sector, encouraging you to beautify and organize your home. Venus enters your efficiency sector too, adding to the Martha Stewart vibe. But don’t do this all by yourself–enlist the help of others. Who cares if they’re not Pisces people, they need to do their share.

"
14 june 2018,pisces,"Avoid control freaks today as they will be in the mood for trying to boss everyone around. This could be at the office or within your personal life, so head for cover. Over the weekend a friend or lover could be acting this way: ignore them, as next Tuesday brings happier energy.

"
15 june 2018,pisces,"Don’t feel as though you have to play by other peoples’ rules, Pisces. Others may be trying to force their opinions or values on you, which will only make you rebel. When your ruler, Neptune, goes retrograde next week you’ll have the chance to consider what’s truly important to you.

"
16 june 2018,pisces,"Enjoying life more is the name of the game with the Sun getting ready to enter the most fun-filled part of your chart. But don’t wait for El Sol to make its move on Thursday: the action can start today as the passionate Moon tells you to get in touch with your frisky side.

"
17 june 2018,pisces,"Your ruler, Neptune, is about to go retrograde, which means that now is a good time to get clear on anything that has been troubling you. If you can’t get a handle on things quickly, don’t worry. Once the Sun enters Cancer on Thursday creative solutions will appear.

"
18 june 2018,pisces,"Neptune goes retrograde today, and considering that this watery planet is your ruler, things may start to slow down in most parts of your life. But romance is cooking along quite nicely, so take a chance on love! It’s time for fun, flirting and great sex.

"
19 june 2018,pisces,"Ready to take a chance in love? The cosmos sure is! Lucky Jupiter (in your house of adventure) is winking at Mercury (in the romance zone). Go ahead….do it! Tell someone that you love them. Ask that person out. Try a new type. Schedule a romantic vacation with your amour. Life’s too short to do things the old, comfortable way.

"
20 june 2018,pisces,"Neptune has just retrograded in your sign, making you question all of the areas of your life. Today the watery planet forms a helpful aspect with intelligent Mercury in your house of romance. Consider what you need to make your love life happier, steamier and more fun. It takes two to tango, of course, but are you tangoing with the right person?

"
21 june 2018,pisces,"Dramatic scenes might ensue now that the Sun is in the most flamboyant part of your chart. Love could become a lot friskier and enjoyable too, as long as you don’t let jealousy and other useless emotions run the show. The next four weeks are also super for creative types, so put in some time at the studio.

"
22 june 2018,pisces,"What a wonderful day (and weekend) to be spontaneous! Lively Uranus, planet of the unpredictable, is in one heck of a good mood. It’s time to forget about your responsibilities and have a good time. Besides, you never know whom you might meet while you’re out there circulating.

"
23 june 2018,pisces,"Pleasing everyone could be a difficult task this weekend…so why bother? The people who truly appreciate you won’t go against you, but others might. That’s OK! The full moon next week falls in your house of friends, so if anyone is too much of a problem, just say adios.

"
24 june 2018,pisces,"Knowing whom you can really trust isn’t always easy, but a helpful lunar aspect puts you in a circle of people who have your back. There could be new people coming in to your life too, folks who know how to have a good time and think creatively.

"
25 june 2018,pisces,"Nitpicky much? Either you or someone else could be hell bent on finding fault or focusing on stuff that doesn’t matter. With Mars about to retrograde in your house of the subconscious mind, you’ll be able to take a good long look at whoever is doing this and figure out why it’s going on. If you’re the culprit, it’s time for some inner work.

"
26 june 2018,pisces,"Your subconscious mind is now in overdrive, thanks to Mars going retrograde in this part of your chart. But that doesn’t mean that your intuition is on target. On the contrary…you may be dreaming up scenarios that are completely off base. Think before you speak or act.

"
27 june 2018,pisces,"The entire free world doesn’t need to know what you’re up to, so keep some things to yourself. Otherwise friends or colleagues could start meddling way too much in your affairs. It may also be time to meet some new people, so be open to folks who are more worldly and wise.

"
28 june 2018,pisces,"Some kind of group activity could come to a successful finale thanks to tonights full moon in Capricorn. This also happens to be your tech sector, so wrap up a website launch, coding an app, or a social media campaign. There could be people around you who are being too dramatic or troublesome. Don’t let them spoil the success of whatever it is you’re working on.

"
29 june 2018,pisces,"Neptune, your ruler, may be retrograde in your sign but that’s not going to stop you! Sharp-as-a-tack Mercury is in the most productive part of your chart. Over the next few weeks you’ll be able to move mountains, leaving people dumb struck at how efficient and talented you are.

"
30 june 2018,pisces,"Someone may try to upset your carefully laid out plans, but don’t give them that opportunity. Perhaps they disagree with your approach. Or maybe they fear that you’ll succeed. Either way, keep calm and carry on.

"
1 july 2018,pisces,"It’s always helpful when people share the same dreams and values as you, and from your chart it appears that greater cooperation is on the way. This is true in both your personal and professional lives, so extend the olive branch and expect others to do the same.

"
3 july 2018,pisces,"So what’s your point? Don’t be afraid of speaking your mind today, even if you think that your ideas may be a little “out there”. Some of your crazy notions might actually be quite workable, so give them the time and attention they deserve.

"
4 july 2018,pisces,"Nurturing yourself is one of the smartest things you could do right now, Pisces. A meeting of the Moon and Neptune is just the ticket for some R and R. Besides, life is going to become more adventurous as of next Tuesday, so rest while you can!

"
5 july 2018,pisces,"Don’t be surprised if your brain starts operating at warp speed today, and in the weeks to come. You are entering into one of the most liberating, optimistic and creative periods you’ve had in a long time. Make the most of it!

"
6 july 2018,pisces,"You may need to set some boundaries with someone who’s pushing it, Pisces. The issue is that this person may be acting behind the scenes or in a passive-aggressive way. Confronting them probably won’t work, but you can figure out a more subtle way for dealing with their nonsense.

"
7 july 2018,pisces,"Both your mind and your mouth could be quite active today, Pisces! This means that you need to think before you speak. That said, you can have a great time chatting with friends and socializing. This is the perfect weekend to be spontaneous, which also includes going on a quick getaway.

"
8 july 2018,pisces,"If you’ve got it, flaunt it, Pisces! A stellar Neptune aspect ramps up your charisma. This is also wonderful day to switch up your look, such as changing your hairstyle or trying a new fashion look. Once Jupiter goes direct on Tuesday you are going to be in the public eye a lot more,  so you might as well look devastating in the process.

"
9 july 2018,pisces,"It’s a close relationship has been stuck, it’s about to develop momentum. That’s because Venus enters your house of committed relationships today. This includes professional as well as personal unions. Over the next three weeks, you can resolve problems from the past and move on to a much more liberated and optimistic place.

"
10 july 2018,pisces,"People who think that you are the dreamy, quiet type are in for big surprise, Pisces. Jupiter resumes direct motion in your house of adventure today, opening doors to some exciting new possibilities! And then on Friday there is a solar eclipse in your house of creativity, drama and fun. There’s going to be no holding you back. Expect people to be sitting on the job on the sidelines with their jaws hanging open.

"
11 july 2018,pisces,"Can we talk? The lines of communication open wide as spontaneous Uranus is in the mood for conversation. You can especially make progress in some of your closest connections. Don’t be afraid to verbalize some of your deepest thoughts.

"
12 july 2018,pisces,"First, the good news. Tomorrow’s a solar eclipse occurs in your house of romance and fun! Now for the disclaimer. Pluto is in a stinky mood from the other side of the heavens. Friends, colleagues or mentors may not be on board with some of the fun ideas that you have in mind. It’s one thing to take advice from these people; it’s another to let them control your life.

"
13 july 2018,pisces,"Sweet! A sizzling solar eclipse kicks open doors in your romance department. More fun, flirting and creativity lie ahead over the next six months. But it’s imperative that you do your own thing. Friends, colleagues and mentors may have a problem with some of the ideas that are popping in your brain. Remember, it’s your life and you deserve to live it your way.

"
14 july 2018,pisces,"A spirit of greater cooperation fills the air with a helpful Venus aspect. Now is the time to open up and let people know exactly what you’re thinking. Long term plans depend on it.

"
15 july 2018,pisces,"You’re in quite an outspoken mood these days, Pisces. In the week ahead there are good days for speaking out, and days that aren’t so great. Fortunately, today is auspicious for speaking your mind. To your surprise people may be very interested in what you have to say, and willing to work with you.

"
17 july 2018,pisces,"It’s not your karma and life to stay stuck in a job that you can’t stand, or to earn less than what you deserve. When the Sun enters Leo on Sunday, a four week period opens in which you can make changes to your employment status. A new gig may seem like a lateral move at first, but it actually holds promise.

"
18 july 2018,pisces,"You may already be feeling the effects of the lunar eclipse that is arriving on July 27th. It falls in your house of closure, and today is a smart time to make an assessment of things and people in your life that need to go. You’re going to be quite practical about this, not worrying about the fallout.

"
19 july 2018,pisces,"You’re in the mood to take some risks, but do you really need to tell everybody about it? It’s smarter to ponder your next move without broadcasting your ideas to everyone. Next week’s lunar eclipse will be a great moment to silently go after your dreams.

"
20 july 2018,pisces,"You may be cautious by nature, but now you’re ready to test some of your more outrageous ideas. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you to hold back. When the Sun enters Leo on Sunday, your practical side will kick in…and you’ll know exactly what to do next.

"
21 july 2018,pisces,"It’s time to bust out of a romantic rut, Pisces. If you’re single and looking, you should be hunting for someone who is a break from the previous types. If you’re unhappily attached, it’s time to head for the door! And if you’re happily involved with someone, you should still be looking for ways to shake things up in the romance department.

"
22 july 2018,pisces,"Snap to it! Get your sorry ass off the sofa and start getting organized. The Sun is now in Leo, your sixth house of efficiency. It’s time to pull your life together both at home and at the office. Mercury is scheduled to retrograde in this sector on Thursday, pointing out the areas that you need to address first.

"
23 july 2018,pisces,"You know what you want and how to get it… or do you? Some mixed vibes coming from the cosmos could confuse you about the direction you’re heading in. It seems to be a problem of too much choice. Create a short list and go from there.

"
24 july 2018,pisces,"You want to get along with other people, truly you do. But a Venus-Neptune opposition is going to make that damn difficult today! The problem is that people will not be direct, possibly resorting to passive aggressive tactics. With the Sun in the most practical part of your chart you need to demand clarity.

"
25 july 2018,pisces,"You may need to be the voice of reason today, as other people seem hell bent on wallowing in chaos. The situation may be getting a little old, but if you don’t take command things could go right off the rails. The full moon on Friday is a good time to separate yourself from all of this drama.

"
26 july 2018,pisces,"Your habits and routines appear to need a complete overhaul, Pisces. Intelligent Mercury goes retrograde today in your house of efficiency. This smart little planet will point out areas in your life that could use some improvement. With Friday’s lunar eclipse in your house of closure, you’ll be able to completely switch over to a new way of doing things.

"
27 july 2018,pisces,"It’s time to get your act together, Pisces. A no-nonsense lunar eclipse is taking place in your house of closure. From your chart, it appears that you need much better habits and systems. You also need to close out chronic health problems. If you’re willing to put in the grunt work, you can make amazing headway over the next six months.

"
28 july 2018,pisces,"This is an excellent weekend for hanging out with both friends and a lover, Pisces. A happy Venus Pluto aspect is just the ticket for socializing with the people who mean the most to you. You may learn things about each other that you never knew before, deepening your bonds.

"
29 july 2018,pisces,"From your chart it appears that your energy levels are down, Pisces. With intelligent Mercury in your house of wellness, you should be researching healthy diet choices and exercise regimens. It’s time to get rid of bad habits that are holding you back from living a vivacious, happy existence.

"
30 july 2018,pisces,"People tend to under estimate your tolerance for taking risk. You are a far more daring person than many people realize, and today is the perfect time to act on some of your wildest dreams. The recent lunar eclipse told you to close out things in your life that are holding you back. Do that and then stepped into a brand-new tomorrow!

"
31 july 2018,pisces,"You may not be in the mood for following the rules today and that’s okay. Your ruler, Neptune is inspiring you to do something a little bit different. Not off the wall; just something that takes you past your comfort zone.

"
1 august 2018,pisces,"Your intuition and logical mind will be at battle today….which is why you shouldn’t make any major decisions! Unreasonable fears could also get the better of you. Wait until Saturday, when things calm down and clarity returns.

"
2 august 2018,pisces,"Start freeing up more time for the more exciting things of life. You simply have to stop working so hard! You need a break, and the only way it’s going to happen is that if you make the decision to cut back on work hours.

"
3 august 2018,pisces,"Watch what you say to people at the office or in a group setting. With the Sun in the most practical part of your chart, you are coming from an intelligent place. But that doesn’t mean that others want to hear your opinions. Let them figure things out for themselves.

"
4 august 2018,pisces,"With unpredictable Uranus acting up in your house of communication, you could say or do just about anything! Whether that’s a good thing or not is another issue. But it’s high time that you expressed yourself. Don’t hold back.

"
5 august 2018,pisces,"You need to stop getting caught up in details, and do some more of a “group think” kind of a thing. Right now some of the people around you have some pretty interesting thoughts. They’re willing to share them, and if you’re smart you will be listening. You can learn a lot from other people.

"
6 august 2018,pisces,"Romantic Venus has just entered your house of sex and intimacy, setting the stage for a few steamy weeks ahead. But with so much planetary energy in the practical part of your chart, your head won’t be lost in the clouds. Singles, you’ll be looking for a team player, the kind of person who knows how to give as well as take.

"
7 august 2018,pisces,"If you find that you’re pulling away from people, you can blame it on the planet Uranus. Today it goes retrograde in your house of socializing. This doesn’t mean that you’re going to become a recluse. Rather, you may decide to work independently and do your own thing.

"
9 august 2018,pisces,"Come out of your shell, Pisces! Venus could be stirring up your emotions, perhaps eroding your self esteem. The best remedy for this is to socialize with people who put a smile on your face. It’s also a good time to make some new connections.

"
10 august 2018,pisces,"People around you may have some big ideas, but do they have the common sense to accomplish them? Make sure that you don’t get pulled into someone else’s crazy ass scheme. Tomorrow solar eclipse occurs in your house of efficiency, turning you into a dynamo. You don’t want to get stuck doing the grunt work that is someone else’s responsibility.

"
11 august 2018,pisces,"It’s time to get down to brass tacks, Pisces. With Jupiter cruising through your optimistic house of big plans and adventures, no doubt you’re ready to take on some exciting new challenges. But today’s solar eclipse falls in the most practical, detail-oriented part of your chart. It’s time to get a handle on the small stuff, as unglamorous as that may sound. Do that and you’ll be ready to take on the world.

"
12 august 2018,pisces,"Friendships and team endeavors are up for revision right now. That’s because red hot Mars is retrograding through the sector that governs them. Are you surrounded by people who support you, and who make you feel appreciated and alive? Or are they weighing you down like an anchor? If it’s the latter, it’s time to make some changes.

"
13 august 2018,pisces,"Misty Neptune is your ruler, which can be a good thing as well as a bad thing! It’s good when it stirs up your intuition and creativity. But it can be difficult when it makes you want to resist other people, which is what is happening today. Wait until tomorrow, a much better time for communicating and getting along with others.

"
14 august 2018,pisces,"Focus on the good in others today, even if it’s tough to do! Nitpicking about others’ faults doesn’t help you and it doesn’t help them. The recent solar eclipse fell in your house of teamwork and getting things done; it will be a heck of a lot easier if you give people credit for their good side.

"
15 august 2018,pisces,"This is no time to think like the rest of the crowd. The problem is, people around you may want you to do things their way. Avoid this if you can. By Friday, the Moon will be in the most freethinking part of your chart, and you’ll be able to strike out on your own.

"
16 august 2018,pisces,"Your ideas and opinions may be brilliant and right on point, but that doesn’t mean that others will agree with them. As a matter of fact, someone could react quite erratically to what you have to say. Let this little storm pass. You don’t have to explain yourself to anyone.

"
17 august 2018,pisces,"Getting motivated today becomes a lot easier thanks to abundant Jupiter in action! If there is something that has been on your bucket list for a long time, now’s the moment to go after it. The good news is that Mercury goes direct in the most practical part of your chart on Sunday. This will help you pursue your dreams in a realistic way.

"
18 august 2018,pisces,"A healthy body is a sexy body, and it’s time to tone up yours. With romantic Venus in your house of libido, and Mercury in the house of fitness, it’s all about glowing….with good health and, uh, the kind of glow you get from a boudoir workout.

"
19 august 2018,pisces,"Screw ups and dramas at the office should start to go bye-bye. Mercury has been retrograde in this part of your chart, but thank heavens it goes direct today. Even if you’re the only person on the job who has their act together, that will be good enough for you!

"
20 august 2018,pisces,"What a day for busting out of an old, tired groove! The two most optimistic planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Neptune, are in a great mood. They’re both pushing you to think out-of-the-box and to take a chance. With the Sun in the most practical part of your chart, you don’t run the risk of doing something foolish either.

"
21 august 2018,pisces,"Today’s cosmic energy is excellent for forging long-term connections with people: friends, a new mentor, people involved in charities or volunteer groups, or business associates. You may be used to going it alone, but over the next four weeks you are encouraged to team up with other people. Besides, you never know whom you might meet!

"
22 august 2018,pisces,"You’re in a position to meet new people who have depth, Pisces. From your chart it appears that you need to be around people who bring a lot to the table, who have your back. Don’t shy away from making new connections.

"
23 august 2018,pisces,"There’s a full moon arriving in your sign this Sunday, and it’s putting your needs front and center. Interesting timing considering that the Sun enters Virgo today, focusing on your most serious relationships. The trick will be about how to balance the two. Don’t make any fast decisions; wait at least two weeks before making any major decisions.

"
24 august 2018,pisces,"It’s a great weekend for partying with your friends thanks to a Moon-Mars merger. It’s also an auspicious time for meeting new people, and some of them could be in your life for a long time to come. Get out of your shell and mingle.

"
25 august 2018,pisces,"Getting along with other people becomes a snap thanks to two fabulous trines today. Friends, lovers, business connections, siblings, neighbors—these specific relationships are highlighted by the cosmic activity. Someone could do something spontaneous, or there could be (good) unexpected news coming your way.

"
26 august 2018,pisces,"It’s always a good thing when a full moon takes place in your sign, and that’s what’s happening tonight! Things that you’ve been working on since your birthday may finally come to pass. This is a time for doing things your  way, so remember that. Others may be interested in pushing their own agenda, but don’t give them a chance.

"
27 august 2018,pisces,"From your chart it appears that you need to meet new people and circulate more, and red hot Mars is in the perfect position to help you do that. No matter how independent you’ve been feeling it’s time to expand your contact list.

"
28 august 2018,pisces,"Keep things on point and don’t go off on tangents. No matter how grand an idea may sound, nothing’s going to happen unless the details are taken care of. Remain practical and get the grunt work done.

"
29 august 2018,pisces,"It’s important right now to be a team player, even if you don’t feel like it! The recent full moon fell in your sign, making you more motivated to pursue your own agenda. But if you come off as being too self-involved, people will get turned off. Play nice and do your own thing behind the scenes.

"
30 august 2018,pisces,"It could be easy to be lulled into a false sense of security today, or even complacency. The world is changing rapidly though, and you need to change with the times. Find a balance between tradition and doing things in a futuristic way.

"
31 august 2018,pisces,"Toss out your daily to-do list. Forget about your routine. A sparkling Moon-Uranus aspect tells you to do something totally spontaneous and fun. If you can get away this weekend on a quick trip, even better.

"
1 september 2018,pisces,"The trolls and the naysayers could be out there, but who cares? Why should you pay any attention to people who don’t know what they’re talking about? Stick to the people who keep things real.

"
2 september 2018,pisces,"Feeling comfortable in your own skin is possible, Pisces. A happy lunar aspect indicates that you should do some inner work, the kind that feeds your soul. Mindfulness meditation might work, or studying Zen Buddhism. The key is to make it a habit.

"
3 september 2018,pisces,"Romantic relationships get a boost from a happy Venus-Mercury aspect that encourages more cooperation. It’s time to balance logic and passion in a union. Too much of either is not a good thing!

"
4 september 2018,pisces,"Team efforts and friendships can go off the rails today. Someone may want to take the group in a different direction, but this is not a good idea. There is a time for the innovation and creativity, and a time to stick to the original plan. Right now the latter is the most important.

"
5 september 2018,pisces,"You’re entering into a new phase in which communicating and cooperating with others will be of the utmost importance. Mercury has just entered your house of diplomacy. Naturally this can benefit a romantic partnership, but you could also end up being the voice of reason at work and among friends.

"
6 september 2018,pisces,"Great minds think alike, and you need to surround yourself by people who know how to think differently! You also need to be surrounded by people who share your interests and know how to have fun. Fortunately for you, serious Saturn has gone direct in your house of networking. Now you can meet a fresh new crop of friends, lovers and partners in crime.

"
7 september 2018,pisces,"Lively Mercury is in one helluva good mood. This little planet is determined to bring new people into your orbit, and to solidify your existing relationships as well. Be flexible today and over the weekend as things could unfold spontaneously.

"
8 september 2018,pisces,"You may need more freedom than you’d care to admit, Pisces. People may be tugging at you, trying to pull you into their worlds, but right now you want to be your own person. And there’s nothing wrong with that! Be polite and diplomatic about it, but maintain boundaries too.

"
10 september 2018,pisces,"You have a “one step forward, two steps back” kind of energy going on. Yesterday, vivacious Venus entered your house of adventure. But today Mars zips into your house of seclusion, rest and reflection. The smart Pisces takes chances, but only after considering all of the angles first.

"
11 september 2018,pisces,"You may have had differences of opinion with people in the past. But that all changes today, thanks to some wonderful aspects that are designed to bring you together. Teamwork increases, along with optimism. You may have to be the person who spearheads this, but take charge. It will be worth it.

"
13 september 2018,pisces,"What is sense and what is nonsense? Separating one from the other could be a chore. Your logical mind says one thing, and your intuitive brain says another. Don’t make any major decisions today; give things 24 hours so that you can ponder them.

"
14 september 2018,pisces,"You might feel as though you’re stuck in the middle of people who can’t seem to agree. Make sure that you don’t become the dumping ground for their issues. And be careful about taking sides too. This could backfire. Be diplomatic and wait until next Tuesday, when the cosmic energy improves.

"
15 september 2018,pisces,"“Plays well with others.” Remember that comment from your report card? Well, that’s the message that the cosmos has for you today: do your best to work with others. You could form some exciting new partnerships or friendships. It’s a good time to consider lending your energy to a charity or volunteer group. Going it alone isn’t advised right now!

"
16 september 2018,pisces,"If life has been a little dull of late… and that includes your romance… it’s time to jazz things up! Happy go lucky Jupiter is in a good mood, encouraging you to take some chances and live a little. Life is too short to do the same old thing all the time, or to be with people who aren’t visionary.

"
17 september 2018,pisces,"It’s time to cut through the myriad of choices available to you and focus on one or two things that count. This doesn’t mean that you can’t pursue other juicy opportunities. But you won’t get anything accomplished if you’re scattering your energy.

"
18 september 2018,pisces,"You might want to climb a mountain and head to the nearest yogi meditation retreat today! If that’s not possible, shut off your phone and don’t look at your email. That’s because a Mars-Uranus clash could bring out the malcontents in droves today. Unless you want them pooping all over you, avoid them.

"
19 september 2018,pisces,"Is it true that opposites attract? In my opinion, opposites may attract but they don’t necessarily stay together. A happy Moon-Sun aspect today helps you get on the same wavelength with others. This is true in love, in business and with your friendships.

"
20 september 2018,pisces,"Diplomacy counts! Do your best to let people know that you’re willing to be a team player. This is true within your family, your friends and at the office. But this doesn’t mean that you should be walked on. Maintain your dignity and extend the olive branch at the same time

"
21 september 2018,pisces,"It’s time to block out the outside world and focus on what really counts. This could mean your romantic relationship. Maybe it’s your career or your health. Mercury has entered a reflective part of your chart, and the Sun arrives tomorrow. The next four weeks are excellent for getting clear about what is important to you.

"
22 september 2018,pisces,"As the Sun moves into Libra, your focus will turn into two major areas in life: your level of intimacy with a lover and your level of wealth! Yup, ancient astrologers placed these in the same sector. The next weeks are crucial for creating more cash flow, the kind you bank–serious  coin. They’re also well respected for improving your love life, especially in the bedroom.

"
23 september 2018,pisces,"Why the heck are you listening to other people have to say? Why are you worried about what they think? You should be listening to the wisest person of them all: you. Your subconscious mind, that is. There is plenty of wisdom there if you’re willing to tap into it.

"
24 september 2018,pisces,"You’re on the cusp of making a lot more money, Pisces. If you’re willing to hustle, that is. Tonight’s full moon occurs in your earnings sector, and it could bring something important to a profitable conclusion. You may be better off working solo right now. From your chart, it appears that team members could be difficult, egotistical or unwilling to do their share. Don’t let them slow down your momentum.

"
25 september 2018,pisces,"Give an inch, take a mile? It may seem that way today. The more you let people off the hook, the more they decide to take advantage of you. Either stand your ground, or avoid those people who seem to be working on their own personal agenda.

"
26 september 2018,pisces,"You may need to change course today. Or perhaps you have to change some habits or a routine. Take care of this right away and don’t delay. Some wonderful new things are about to open up, and you need to be at the right place at the right time.

"
27 september 2018,pisces,"You are in an open frame of mind today, able to listen to other peoples’ opinions and honor them. It’s important that you express your feelings and opinions too. Things that you thought were problems may start to disappear, thanks to your compassion and consideration.

"
28 september 2018,pisces,"There’s nothing wrong with lofty ideas. But if you want them to take flight, you have to do the requisite planning. From your chart, it appears that your head is in the clouds…and you’re not thinking about what it’s going to take to get things done. Start planning now.

"
29 september 2018,pisces,"It’s time to pay attention to your nearest and dearest, Pisces. Your life can’t be about work all the time, or getting errands done. The people who are closest to you need you, and you need them. Don’t forget that.

"
30 september 2018,pisces,"Anyone who thinks that you’re a sensitive type needs to pay attention, Pisces. Yes, you have feelings just like the rest of us. But you’re also shrewd and logical, something that they may realize today.

"
1 october 2018,pisces,"Trying to fit in with the crowd will backfire today, so don’t even try. You are your own person with your own ideas and dreams. Gaining permission from others to live authentically is not necessary. Wednesday is the perfect time to let your freak flag fly!

"
2 october 2018,pisces,"You know what they say: it takes teamwork to make the dream work. Problem is, teamwork will be in short supply today. Egotistical people may try to take over, or refuse to do their share. Wait until Monday’s new Moon to try to get the situation back on track.

"
3 october 2018,pisces,"You should be feeling daring, optimistic and ready for change…..and there’s nothing wrong with that! So go ahead, take a chance. Put yourself out there. Adventure is calling your name.

"
4 october 2018,pisces,"Make sure that you can deliver what you promise, Pisces. A Moon-Uranus square could prompt you to say things that could be hard to honor later on. Remaining practical and conservative is the smartest thing you can do today.

"
5 october 2018,pisces,"Audacious plans may need to be revised over the next three weeks. Venus has just started spinning backward in your house of travel, education, entrepreneurship and anything that’s big and bold. But this won’t last long; it will be over by the 31st. In the meantime, do your homework on these projects.

"
6 october 2018,pisces,"It won’t be easy to figure out what motives people have this weekend. There will be a lot of opinionated people in your life over the next week, which could make things more complicated. So take your time and don’t make any big decisions.

"
7 october 2018,pisces,"It’s time for an emotional cleansing, Pisces. Tomorrow’s new Moon occurs in one of the most psychological parts of your chart. We all have past traumas and emotions that are holding us back. Dump yours and get ready to move on.

"
8 october 2018,pisces,"There is a new Moon in your house of deep emotion, so why is it so hard to get the words out? It’s because the two most obstinate planets in the solar system, Mars and Uranus, are in wonky positions. That’s okay. You have six months to express yourself. This is an excellent time to do some much needed inner work.

"
9 october 2018,pisces,"Taking intelligent chances is the name of the game now that Mercury is in Scorpio. Over the next three weeks, you can consider new ways of doing things. Don’t dive in to quickly, though. Consider your options, and then get ready to launch on the 23rd.

"
11 october 2018,pisces,"Now that Mercury is in your house of breaking the rules, it’s time to do just that! But this isn’t about being a lone rebel. You should be teaming up with others who know how to think differently, who want to shake things up in a good way.

"
12 october 2018,pisces,"The more the merrier! The cosmos is telling you to get out of the house or the office and boogie down. Actually, next week is looking pretty social too, so get the party started now….and keep it going.

"
13 october 2018,pisces,"You may not feel like doing much this weekend, and that’s OK. You need a break. And the Moon enters into your house of friends and partying, all the more reason to have a good time!

"
14 october 2018,pisces,"If you need to ask a trusted friend for help or advice, now’s the time to do so. People are going to show their true colors this week. Find the ones you can count on.

"
15 october 2018,pisces,"Honey, you are so ready for adventure. A glistening Mercury-Venus conjunction is pushing you to try some new things (which includes people!). Planets in your networking sector are telling you to find partners in crime (in a manner of speaking). It’s time to do a “Thelma and Louise”.

"
16 october 2018,pisces,"You’re known by the company you keep, and the cosmos is telling you to make some changes. This doesn’t mean that you should dump the tribe. But you should consider joining up with new people, the kind that are excited about life and want to savor every moment of it.

"
17 october 2018,pisces,"You’re in a highly intuitive state these days, so use that to your advantage! But even psychics have blind spots. So don’t assume that you’re going to have a 100% success rate. Use some logic too.

"
18 october 2018,pisces,"Your mind could stir up all kinds of dramas today, many of which aren’t based on reality. This is especially true if you’re on the verge of making a big change. Quit worrying and take the plunge!

"
19 october 2018,pisces,"Anyone who thinks that a Pisces isn’t bold and daring ought to take a look at you now! A Neptune-Mercury aspect is bringing out your flamboyant, risk-taking side. There could be dream stealers or trolls in your midst, though. Are you going to pay any attention to them? Hell, no!

"
20 october 2018,pisces,"You’re vibey and intuitive. You’re charming and persuasive. You’re magnetic and fun to be around. Yup, your ruler, Neptune, is placing the cosmic focus on you this weekend. Enjoy.

"
21 october 2018,pisces,"You have a good kind of problem going on, in a way! Benevolent Jupiter is stirring up your mind, helping you come up with all sorts of genius ideas. But which ones to pick? The full moon on Wednesday will help you narrow down your choices.

"
22 october 2018,pisces,"Why do everything by yourself? Today is a smart time to find others to team up with. Don’t work hard, work smart.

"
23 october 2018,pisces,"You’re raring to go now that El Sol is in the most high spirited part of your chart. Just remember, it will be here for four weeks. This is important, because unpredictable Uranus is acting out for the next few days. Don’t rush into new plans too quickly or blab about them. Details count too.

"
24 october 2018,pisces,"Some important news could come your way thanks to the full moon in Taurus.This could be big and it could be unexpected. But it should be good! Over the next two weeks you can see action taking place.

"
25 october 2018,pisces,"Vision boards have been around for awhile. Some people think they’re a waste of time, while others believe that it’s helpful to have a clear picture about where you’re going. Today’s lunar activity suggests that you create some kind of visual road map for yourself. After all, seeing is believing!

"
26 october 2018,pisces,"If you’ve been a little worried about putting yourself out there, forget your cares. A happy Sun-Venus connection will boost your confidence. You’ve got this, and it’s time to show the world that you’re not a shrinking violet. Go ahead, surprise everyone.

They’re on a mission to see that you live a truly authentic life. And when Mercury enters your house of goals on Wednesday, it’s all systems go.

"
30 october 2018,pisces,"You could find yourself in the middle of someone else’s drama. The question is: do you really want to be involved? You may mean well, but this situation may not be worth it. Besides, your values may be quite different than those of the other person. Be of assistance but not too much!

"
31 october 2018,pisces,"It seems that you have a lot of thinking to do when it comes to your future path. Mercury enters your house of success and dream achievement today, but at the same time Venus retrogrades, making you question what to do next. Wait until November 15th before committing to anything or anyone.

"
1 november 2018,pisces,"Come on, live a little! Expansive Jupiter in your house of taking risks is pushing you to be a bit bold. You may shake up the people who know you. But deep down inside, you always knew that you had it going on.

"
2 november 2018,pisces,"You won’t be in the mood today for taking advice from other people. After all, do they really know what’s best for you? A potent Sun-Neptune aspect on Tuesday is better for soliciting advice from people who really know what’s going on.

"
3 november 2018,pisces,"Be true to yourself, Pisces. If you do that then life will fall into place. But if you try to mold yourself into someone that you’re not, especially to please others, you’ll never find contentment.

"
4 november 2018,pisces,"Plans and dreams that have been stuck start to develop momentum this week. This is in part due to your passion.  If you believe in something enough, and apply your passion to it, you will be an unstoppable force.

"
5 november 2018,pisces,"The next six months can be some of the most uplifting in years. A potent Neptune aspect is just the ticket for setting off on a brand new course or way of doing things. By this time next year your life can be extraordinarily different. But it’s all up to you.

"
6 november 2018,pisces,"Money matters from early 2018 may come back to be revisited. That’s because Uranus retrogrades today into your house of cash and savings.

"
7 november 2018,pisces,"Adventure awaits! Today’s new Moon takes place in the most open-minded part of your chart. Be willing to meet new people and take on fresh challenges.

"

"
12 november 2018,pisces,"You need to align yourself with people who share your ideals. If you’re already in that position, it’s a good thing. But if not, make it your business to find people who will push you to grow and enjoy life more.

"
13 november 2018,pisces,"Your skills and talent are worth money, Pisces. So if you want to develop your skill set in order to earn more, today is a good time to research your options: classes, seminars, webinars and working with a mentor are all advised.

"
